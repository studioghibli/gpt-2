        ['“I wanted to see a statue of the Confederacy, but that\'s not part of the history of the history of this country. We shouldn’t honor this history. We shouldn’t honor this history with an epithet like that.”\nThe mayor of Fort Worth, Greg Abbott, said in a statement Monday that “we need to know this history. The statue isn’t something we should celebrate in the South. There are many different ways to honor our heritage.” But as the president of the National Museum of African-American History and Culture said Monday when a Confederate flag was flown at the Museum of African-American History and Culture’s Capitol Hill offices, the museum is wrong.\n“The museum should never have painted that flag on the Capitol Hill building grounds,” Mr. Abbott said. “It made sense, but that’s not how it should be,” he added. “Our history is about what we call a legacy —”\nMr. Abbott said that the Confederate flag was “a symbol of our slavery under a president who would have banned it,” adding that even then, the statues in his city, especially those in his own city, “had to be removed because they should never have been there.”\nThe flag used by Confederate troops during the civil war has been used as a symbol of racism for generations, and it will soon be the symbol of a major national reckoning at a time when some of the country’s most prominent black leaders are struggling to understand the significance of the symbol and its significance to their communities.\nMany in the Confederate movement are also fighting at the state and national level for broader support for the group, which has been fighting to bring the word into the world outside the official ban. Confederate troops were known to wear head coverings on their uniforms in the Confederate states of North Carolina and South Carolina.\nAt a recent state and national gathering hosted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, Confederate officials said that Confederate heritage should be represented in the country’s first state statute. That law would require monuments, such as the one commemorating Robert E. Lee, to commemorate the Confederacy, while acknowledging the nation’s heritage, the law states.\nA monument commemorating the battle for independence in the South, a symbol of the Confederacy, was unveiled early Tuesday morning by the Confederacy’ headquarters in Alexandria and set into a park at 8 a.m.\n“Now that the Confederacy and all of the white men who had the Confederacy’s flag and arms in them, we have a place to honor their struggle, we can all have a voice to tell our stories,” said a woman who was at the gathering. “When we speak, we have to tell the history that they fought for.”\nMembers of The National Guard had to break up a rally on Capitol Hill that was being attended by many white people.',

        "On March 23, a new bill became law in the House, calling for the creation of an emergency room and mental health unit for law enforcement officers. The administration has also been able to deploy its security forces to state and local police departments around the country. In Los Angeles County, officials took advantage of the fact that police departments have historically provided only a small percentage of the public with support to keep their law enforcement divisions safe during political campaigns. In Texas, an estimated 40 percent of police officers work under the state or local law enforcement umbrella and more than double the nationwide average. Some departments have even become home to law enforcement agencies that do not have the same level of security, like the police department at the University of Texas at Austin. In New York, however, police unions in three cities, including Stuyvesant, are under pressure to keep police in place, or to lay off employees. In Washington, the police union in Manhattan said at a news conference on March 1 that the city had received 20 requests for a contract to serve as the police union's headquarters. Last month, the union issued an announcement that included a pledge that the Police Department would become a national organization that would hold the mayor's chair position, an effort initially opposed by several of the cities already in charge of the police. In the past three days alone, at least five officers have been killed in encounters with armed civilians outside the George Washington Bridge during protests across the nation, according to federal data. In New Jersey, two officers were seriously injured after a series of protests demanding justice for the unarmed black men killed in the killing of George Floyd in 2009. In Atlanta, one officer was killed and two police employees were wounded when a man with a knife attempted to enter an apartment block in a predominantly black neighborhood. The unrest over the death of George Floyd, who was found dead, galvanized the nation in the weeks immediately following his death and became the catalyst for the national movement for civil rights that drew Americans together to demand justice for African Americans. But the killing of Mr. Floyd and the protests surrounding him raised more questions than answers. It was not immediately clear who, or what, was involved in the killing of Mr. Floyd, in spite of calls from some black officials that the killing was the work of white people. But the movement became a powerful symbol of the struggles to bring justice for Black Americans who have been disenfranchised in a culture of oppression. The police and national governments have been silent. The president, after he was arrested on several charges with three other black officers, declared a state of emergency in three states as protests over Mr. Floyd intensified; there was no immediate statement from Mr. Trump.",

        "Mr. Trump has dismissed his critics — notably his former National Security Adviser Michael T. Flynn — as traitors to his presidency. On Thursday, he fired Mr. Flynn, who had worked with Mr. Trump on national security matters, after he refused to give Mr. Trump a security clearance. And in some cases, the firings, which could land him in prison, threaten to tear down his presidency. As protests have spread around the nation against the police killings and racism that have plagued American cities and towns in recent days, so, too, has the unrest over Mr. Trump. On Monday, the mayor of Los Angeles, Angel Arruda, resigned after an investigation revealed that he had sought to take over from John A. McGraw, the mayor of Los Angeles, who was tapped as the city's new police chief and chief of police for the first time after Mr. Trump's firing. Mr. McGraw, 61, spent nearly a year as Trump campaign manager before assuming the job of police chief in May. Within two weeks, Mr. Trump fired Mr. McGraw, who had served as a campaign adviser during the 2016 campaign. The same month, in a speech to a rally in Philadelphia, Mr. Trump said that he wanted to be able to work with the city to bring about change. One of Mr. McGraw's closest aides, Robert Kelner, was fired last week after a complaint that a police officer had defroated his desk and touched Mr. Trump. A federal grand jury had subpoenaed Mr. Kelner, a veteran federal investigator, to testify in the case."];

        "On Sunday, the United States and China suspended trade in some of their top trade violators for the first time since the virus first hit the United States in March. And the United Kingdom announced a ban on exports of food products that might be contaminated with the coronavirus, which has killed more than 60,000 people. The United States will continue to export its largest exports of food products to China, which has been the most aggressive violator of the world's largest single trade pact, the United Nations Convention on Trade in Endangered Species. China is one of the most aggressive violators, but it has continued to trade in food products to China, China Today reports. But the U.S. and China are both still refusing to let the United Kingdom sell its largest exports of food, as they remain the most aggressive violators. The ban will remain in effect until a new batch of vaccines is produced, which would take six weeks to produce, and China has not decided how long the vaccines should last. The United States will continue to trade food products to China, but is now the world's largest trade violator. It has been the world's biggest trade violator since the virus first hit the United States in March. China is one of the biggest food importers in the world. It has been the world's biggest food importer since the virus first hit the United States in March. On Sunday, the United States agreed to halt exports of U.S. food products to China, amid concerns that the Chinese government may have used the U.S. government as a pawn in the U.S.-Chinese trade-off. But Chinese officials are determined to make sure the U.S. doesn't have an opportunity to force Beijing to make concessions to stop its biggest trade partners from using Chinese resources to push for their own survival.",

        ["But in a special election matchup, voters in the state are divided. Democrats would win the state and Republicans would be in a similar position. The HuffPost Pollster/Marist poll surveyed 1,002 likely voters in Kansas, including 1,006 registered Republicans and 1,008 likely Democratic voters. A similar survey conducted in the mid-Atlantic states of Virginia and North Carolina has the GOP out-maneuvering the Democratic challenger in the battleground nation of North Carolina. In each of those states, which Democrats have carried in recent years, Democrats have won 59 percent of registered voters, compared with 54 percent for Republican candidates. The survey, which also included 823 likely Iowa and 721 likely New Hampshire Democrats, is the first of its kind in the nation, and the first poll to be conducted since Iowa and New Hampshire last month. The poll polled 1,014 likely voters across the country and found Republicans beating Democrats by 60 percent to 30 percent. In Iowa, Democratic candidate Ed Rendell (R), who has been in the race for months, has led by two points in the past week despite having lost a single seat by six points. In North Carolina, Democratic candidates have won by six points, and in North Dakota, Democrats have won by seven points with just over a month to go. A third poll in New Hampshire has the Republican Party holding strong in several key battleground states this week, including Colorado, Iowa, Nevada and Pennsylvania. In Nevada, Republican candidate Joni Ernst (R) is on track to win the state, while GOP challenger Scott Brown (R) has been downgraded from an automatic Republican target to a potentially contested Republican target. In Pennsylvania, Republican candidate Katie McGinty (D) is now in the lead following the defeat of Democratic challenger Ken Cuccinelli II, and a third poll earlier this week had the Republican candidate trailing by four points. In Maryland, Republican candidate Catherine Cortez Masto (R) is holding a lead that could be even bigger than her previous two-point lead. The poll, conducted Dec. 24 to 26, had Cortez Masto at 42 percent and Masto at 27 percent. In Florida, Republican Ben Ray Luján (D) would lose the state to Republican challenger Ed Gillespie (R) by more than two points, and Republican candidate Steve King (R) would lead by three. The poll also found the Republican ticket holds strong support.",

        "More than 80 percent of the total cast in New York is male and a significant proportion of Hispanics, who are voting in large numbers, are female. A similar trend was observed in other states in 2012. In many states, turnout among the poor has reached levels that were not present on Election Day when Obama won in the White House. In a separate survey conducted just before the election, more than 50 percent of registered voters said they were not sure how to vote in New York. The federal government also said it expects to count more than 1 million provisional ballots in the first half of the week. Those figures, if accurate, would take into account all of the ballots counted in the United States. The Electoral College and the popular vote count are based on the counting of votes in states with a large number of registered voters. The Electoral College is the most widely used federal election process. The Electoral College, known as the balloting process, is designed to determine the percentage of votes counted and which states will be counted in the year. The Electoral College does not count ballots cast by registered voters. It does not count ballots cast at a polling place for election purposes. The Electoral College also is not designed to determine who the president will be. It is the official election process of the United States. In the first-day of polls, polling places in dozens of swing states showed much of the nation casting ballots, including some in New York and Philadelphia. But turnout in each of those states was about as strong as it was a year ago when Obama won the 2016 election, according to data released Wednesday by Election Day Inc., which tracks U.S. election data. Of those who cast ballots, nearly half voted at home, with more than a quarter in New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania — and more than four in Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Idaho, Nebraska and Washington, D.C. In most states, the turnout was down from the previous year as turnout among registered voters soared. In New Hampshire, about 20,000 did not vote by ballot box on Election Day, compared with about 16,000 for the previous year. The Democratic National Committee said it had received about 1 million more votes than expected from registered voters, and had about 1.4 million more than anticipated from voters of all registered races. The Democratic National Committee said the number of registered voters in New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin had surged by about 1 million.",

        "After the last election, there have been multiple reports of the outcome of the gubernatorial race – and the lack of confidence in the electoral process. A new paper by the Pennsylvania Office of Elections found that the majority of Pennsylvania's voters are not willing to consider any outcome of the race. The Pennsylvania Legislature and the state's House of Representatives have repeatedly refused to consider any election results that could affect their own party. Governor Patrick Corbett has repeatedly refused to consider any election results that could affect his own party. He has even refused to hold a hearing on a proposed state budget. Pennsylvania's new law will likely have a major impact on the state's political landscape. The new law would prevent Pennsylvania from being a party that decides who needs to be in office in advance of the November presidential election. This law is a big deal in a state that is the only state in the country that doesn't have a party. The PA Election Integrity Project has documented three separate scandals involving Pennsylvania's electoral process over the last year. The first was the corruption scandal that erupted last summer when a group of state officials, including a lieutenant governor and several county commissioners, voted to drop out of the race. The second is the ongoing investigation of a corruption scandal by a state committee that was led by John O'Keefe, a former Pennsylvania state senator who later ran for president and lost. The third scandal is that the Pennsylvania Legislature has not even considered the possibility of any new election results for the next two months. It is unclear if the legislature will seriously consider a new election outcome after the November election. Pennsylvania is already under a federal court order to resolve issues related to the election. There have also been reports that some of the state's Democratic and Republican parties are calling for a recount of election results. Democrats have been seeking recounts of the votes that have already been counted. Republicans have been demanding recounts of the votes that have already been counted. The two sides have met this week at the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, where they have met in an effort to ensure that more Pennsylvania votes are counted. Pennsylvania's new law would mean that the state would need to count its electoral votes in more than two months. The Pennsylvania Legislature is the only state that hasn't decided to count its votes, meaning the state would have to vote in its 2016 elections or face an extraordinary challenge from the Democrats. The legislature also needs to make sure that the Pennsylvania law is enforced."];
