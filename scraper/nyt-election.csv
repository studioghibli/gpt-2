"In Pennsylvania, Trump Voter Fury Foretells a Nation Still Divided","PITTSBURGH — Like many Trump supporters, Dennis Tippie watched the steady tallying of votes that wiped away the president’s early lead in Pennsylvania, not with a faith that democracy was playing out but with dark and rising anger.

“If he does end up with that number of electoral votes,” he said last week of Joseph R. Biden Jr., as Mr. Biden appeared on his way to winning the state and the White House, “he would have gained them through fraud, deception and simple criminality.’’

No evidence exists of fraud, deception or criminality in the tallying of absentee ballots that piled up during the worst health crisis to hit the nation in a century. The state’s Republican-controlled legislature refused to allow those ballots to be processed as they came in, compounding the delays until the race was called on Saturday, making Mr. Biden the 46th president-elect.

But Mr. Tippie, a retired truck driver who imbibed the president’s words partly through Fox News, agreed with Mr. Trump and his surrogates that the election had been stolen before their eyes. He lives in Nanty Glo, Pa., in the interior of the state that the so-called elites in Philadelphia sometimes call “Pennsyltucky.” To Mr. Tippie, Mr. Biden is “a total fool,” his running mate, Kamala Harris, is “a very scary woman,” and a Biden presidency would be both illegitimate and disastrous.

But, he said, “I’m not resigned to him being president.”

While Mr. Biden pulled off major successes in flipping Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania back to Democrats, and achieved the rare ouster of an incumbent, he did not notch the landslide demolishment of Mr. Trump that many Democrats had yearned for, despite leading in the popular vote by more than four million.

Instead, Mr. Biden will inherit a country where many Americans are already backed into mutually hostile corners. It threatens the president-elect’s most basic campaign pledge: to unite Americans, to move past divisiveness as a governing strategy, to heal the “soul of the nation.”

“I think we’re a long way from unifying the country, and I’m sure that Trump will continue to work on dividing us,” said Catherine Lalonde, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party in Butler County, a blue-collar region in western Pennsylvania.

“I don’t believe his supporters will accept Biden’s win and wouldn’t even if it were a larger margin,” she added. “I have a feeling that all the Trump flags and signs will stay put until they disintegrate.”

Interviews with voters in Pennsylvania, primarily Trump supporters, showed that Pennsylvania mirrored a nation still mired in tribal polarization. The country may be staggering forward as bitterly divided as ever.

Many of the president’s supporters were swayed by his blizzard of disinformation that illegal voting had been rampant and election officials were suppressing a Trump victory. They envision a Democratic White House that would kowtow to leftists, give up the fight against China and embolden rioters and looters.

While Mr. Biden did slightly better in Pennsylvania’s many Trump counties than Hillary Clinton did in 2016, the margins did not tighten as much as Democrats expected or hoped for. With record turnout approaching 7 million in the state, Mr. Biden’s advantage over Mr. Trump was less than 1 percentage point as of Saturday night — a far cry from Barack Obama’s victories of more than 10 points in 2008 and more than five in 2012.

Certainly, there were Trump voters ready to accept the results as fair and to move forward.

Chace Torres, 37, was making grilled-cheese sandwiches for his family in Northampton County on Thursday night. At the time, Mr. Trump’s lead in the state, once close to 700,000, was ebbing away as mailed-in ballots were counted.

“I think the Trump supporters are going to suck it up and move on,” said Mr. Torres, a union railroad worker. “We’re not going to run out tomorrow and loot and riot. We’re going to put our heads down, go to work, feed our children, take care of the country like we always do.""

But others were not swayed by Mr. Biden’s appeals for unity after four divisive years.

Jessica Bell, a Trump voter in suburban Philadelphia, said, “we are locked and loaded” because she sees the country headed for civil disorder.

“I have my TV on the news 24/7,’’ Ms. Bell said. “I have my phone in my hand keeping up with social media. I’ve gotten about six hours of sleep since Monday. I’ve been watching very, very closely.”

She cited reports on social media and Fox News in support of her belief that the election was hijacked: black Sharpies given to Arizona voters made ballots invalid; Republican poll watchers in Philadelphia were not allowed to see the counting; Nancy Pelosi controls the company supplying election machines in Nevada.

Those charges, some raised by the Trump campaign and the president himself, are distortions or outright conspiracies. Arizona election officials, for example, said black Sharpies do not invalidate a ballot, and a judge allowed observers in Philadelphia within six feet of ballot canvassing.

But Ms. Bell, 32, who left a job this summer as an assistant in a doctor’s office, insisted that “Americans are being silenced” and made the baseless charge, “It’s a coup.”

Some Democrats were hopeful that with Mr. Trump out of office, the nation would return to a semblance of normalcy, that sowing division as government policy would end.

In Erie County, which Mr. Trump had won in 2016 after it long voted Democratic, the president had raised expectations and hopes with his promises of restoring industry. But Mr. Trump lost Erie County this year, in part because of his mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic and the chaos he sowed, said Carl Anderson III, a Democrat on the county council.

“His flaws have been exposed,"" Mr. Anderson said. “There are elements of extremists and ideologues who will initially not accept the outcome and perhaps protest, but as the dust settles and reality emerges, normalcy will take over.”

The nature of Mr. Biden’s narrow victory in Pennsylvania underscored the challenges he will now face. His vote count was driven by a surge of suburban voters: He improved on Mrs. Clinton’s 2016 margins in the vote-rich counties surrounding Philadelphia by notable margins, including by more than 7 percentage points in Chester County and nearly five points in Montgomery County, the state’s third most populous.

But in red Pennsylvania — a vast swath from the northeast through the center to the southwest — Mr. Trump gave up very little ground. He won most rural and small-city counties, with their faded industrial economies, by landslides. It suggests that the message behind Trumpism — a combination of a promised industrial restoration and white grievances — has lost none of its appeal.

“The people here still feel forgotten,"" said Rob Gleason, a former chairman of the state Republican Party who lives in Johnstown, once a steel-making center, now bleeding population and struggling. “I can’t tell you how many people are saying Trump’s saying what I’ve been thinking all my life.”

Four years ago, Cambria County, which includes Johnstown, went for Mr. Trump by 37 points. This year, the county favored him by an identical margin.

“The Trump support here in the rural counties and out west, it will linger for two years,’’ Mr. Gleason said.

He predicted that with Mr. Biden in the White House, Republican senators will block him at every turn, with an eye on gaining seats in the 2022 midterms.

“You know the Senate won’t give him an inch,"" he said.

Democrats’ opinions of Trump supporters over the past five years have been driven partly by reporters’ treks to places like Johnstown, once a Democratic stronghold. Many Democrats view the president’s base as being in thrall to an authoritarian, energized by his racism and xenophobia, and unable to separate reality from his endless lies.

Many Trump supporters, in turn, have no more generous view of Biden voters. “Most of them are morons,” said Lois Peters, a retired department store saleswoman in Westmoreland County.

She was baffled that Biden voters could not see what she does, that the former vice president is mentally unfit to lead, and that a permissive, liberal Biden administration would give rise to violence and looting, as in the aftermath of some demonstrations against police shootings and abuse of Black people this spring.

“That V.P. of Biden’s, oh my God, that woman is vicious,"" Ms. Peters said of Ms. Harris. Then she caught herself. “Now I’m sounding vicious,” she said. She continued, “But I feel like that, I do.”

Mary Jo DePalma, 60, who with her husband owns a jewelry store in Westmoreland County, said Democrats “seem to hate the president so bad” that she feared even Mr. Biden’s victory would not end their animosity toward the right. “It’s going to take a miracle to heal the nation,” she said. “I believe this started a long time ago, not just in the past three years.”

“I hope two years from now, I’m dead wrong,"" she added. “I want the country to be united. I want to continue to have faith in America.”"
"Biden Leads, but No Call Yet Four Days After Election: This Week in the 2020 Race","Welcome to our weekly analysis of the state of the 2020 campaign.

As Election Day turned into Election Week, an anxious nation lost days of productivity, with Americans interested only in what map gurus like CNN’s John King and MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki had to say about the effect of every new tranche of votes on the outcome of the race. And, a bold race call awarding Arizona to Joseph R. Biden Jr. by Fox News on election night, followed by The Associated Press, shocked the Trump campaign.

As of late Friday, Mr. Biden was within striking distance of being the next president of the United States, powered by tight statewide victories in the Midwest states that went for President Trump in 2016: Michigan and Wisconsin. Mr. Biden was leading in Pennsylvania, another state that went for Mr. Trump in the last cycle. The former vice president was ahead in Arizona in the West, and Georgia in the South — giving Democrats hope for future victories in those states in spite of poor results down ballot elsewhere.

It was a mixed bag of results that is not yet final, as some states may require a recount while others continue to count ballots. Here are four takeaways from the results we know so far:

Democrats spent election night in a state of panic, as it became clear that Republican turnout surged passed polling predictions and Mr. Trump had an enduring coalition. By Thursday, as Mr. Biden edged closer to 270 electoral votes, Democratic fears had subsided but not disappeared. The party lost key Congressional races, failed to flip several state legislatures, and continued to show weakness among voting populations in Florida, Texas and Iowa.

The good news:

The ‘Blue Wall’ was repaired: Since the beginning, Mr. Biden’s campaign promised to win back the Midwestern states that delivered Mr. Trump an Electoral College victory in 2016. With wins in Michigan and Wisconsin so far, he’s close to doing it. The margin was smaller than most polling predicted, and Mr. Trump showed real durability in rural areas, but Mr. Biden seems to have done enough. Going forward, that breaks down the belief that the party had become to localized to the coasts.

Georgia looks promising: The Georgia special election for the Senate seat currently held by Kelly Loeffler, who was appointed to the position, will move to a runoff. Ms. Loeffler will face the Rev. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, in January. The state’s other senator, David Purdue, is also heading to a runoff after he failed to clear 50 percent in a tight race against his Democratic challenger, Jon Ossoff. Mr. Biden pulled ahead of Mr. Trump in the state early Friday morning as tallies in the vote-rich Atlanta suburbs notched up for the Democrat. A race call there was not expected for weeks, but Nate Cohn said the president would likely need a tabulation error to win. The last Democrat to be elected president here was Bill Clinton in 1992.

There was one subset of the political world that felt vindicated by the nail-biter presidential race: Democrats who worked for Hillary Clinton. The closeness of the Biden-Trump race suggests that the 2016 election outcome may have been less about Mrs. Clinton’s political weaknesses than it was about Mr. Trump’s political strengths.

In some of the states that Mr. Biden managed to flip, like Wisconsin, his victory was by a slim margin of about 20,000 votes. Four years ago, Mrs. Clinton lost the state by about 22,000. A potential victory with more than 300 electoral votes would look like a blowout for Mr. Biden, but it would also mask the fact that in some of the most critical states, the race was still only won by a hair.

Mr. Biden has not received the wide margins nationwide that many liberals had been hoping for. The silver lining for some former members of Clintonworld, as one put it: The 2016 Democratic nominee might not go down in history as the political version of Bill Buckner, who blew the World Series for the Red Sox in 1986 by letting a ground ball go through his legs.

“His electoral strength in 2016 had less to do with any shortcomings of Hillary Clinton as a candidate or of her campaign than with Trump’s own appeal to a broad segment of the population,” Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union and a member of the D.N.C.’s executive committee, said of Mr. Trump. “We need as Democrats to understand that and confront it more effectively going forward.”

Philippe Reines, a former top adviser to Mrs. Clinton both in the Senate and at the State Department, was even more blunt. “Hillary’s owed more than a few apologies for how her campaign was assessed,” Mr. Reines said. Jennifer Palmieri, who served as communications director for the 2016 Clinton campaign, said that the current election gives a new perspective to the race four years ago.

“There’s only so much you can do to ameliorate larger forces,” Ms. Palmieri said. “When I see young Latino and African-American men siding with Trump in a way they didn’t in 2016, I don’t fault the Biden campaign’s African-American radio program. It is a symptom of a larger change that’s happening.”

The tight map means that the Trump campaign will be forced to reckon with the realization that if they had done any number of small things differently, or if the candidate had not pursued unhelpful fights with political enemies (even beyond the grave), this thing could have gone the other way.

Campaign officials and outside advisers acknowledged that Republicans were damaged in Arizona by Mr. Trump’s yearslong feud with Senator John McCain, a beloved figure in his home state, a personal disdain that continued even after he died in 2018. Fox News and The A.P. called Arizona for Mr. Biden on Tuesday night.

In Georgia, Mr. Biden took a narrow lead on Friday thanks to votes from Clayton County, the district that was represented by former Representative John Lewis, the civil rights icon who died in July. Mr. Trump had berated Mr. Lewis for calling his presidency “illegitimate,” noting that he should spend more time fixing his “horrible” and “crime-infested” district. Apparently, those words were not easily forgotten by the voters who lived there.

Some of his supporters were already playing the “what if” game, more broadly. “Where would Trump be if he never said what he said about Charlottesville, if he never said what he said about Khizr Khan, about Mika Brzezinski,” said Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary to President George W. Bush. In other words, where would he be if he wasn’t Donald Trump?"
The Unforeseen Threats to the 2020 Election: Hand Sanitizer and Bad Plumbing,"[Cheers erupt on New York City streets after President-elect Joe Biden’s victory is declared.]

Poll workers in Derry, N.H., learned the hard way earlier this year that hand sanitizer and paper ballots do not mix. So on Election Day, they carefully repositioned the gallon tubs of sanitizer from the entrance of their polling place to the exit, hoping to keep voters from gunking up their ballots.

But their effort could not stop the woman who brought her own bottle of hand sanitizer and applied a heavy lather as she voted, dampening the paper so much that the AccuVote ballot reader refused to accept it. When the soggy ballot was finally yanked out of the jammed contraption, there was no mistaking what had happened: Everyone could see the voter’s wet handprint on the paper.

“I don’t know what it is about hand sanitizer, maybe it’s the alcoholic content, but if you ever tried to pour hand sanitizer on nicer paper, it almost — I don’t want to say it disintegrates, but it makes it weaker,” said Tina Guilford, the top election official in Derry, who has come to learn how to process those accidentally sanitized ballots.

In a year when interference by foreign governments, armed protesters and voter suppression were considered the main threats at the polls, some Election Day holdups were the result of everyday municipal malfunctions.

Those setbacks highlight the decentralized nature of national elections, which rely on hundreds of thousands of everyday people to work the polls. And they bring attention to what some advocates have been urging for years: the need for better basic infrastructure in some voting locations, including new polling places to reduce crowding and improved systems to register online or vote by mail.

Lawrence Norden, the director of the election reform program at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, said election officials seemed better prepared this year, in part because of the microscope the coronavirus pandemic and fears of meddling placed over the 2020 election. Congress also sent $400 million to the states as part of the economic stimulus bill signed by President Trump in March to help them make adjustments for safe elections, although some Democrats said at the time that more money was needed.

“There’s no question that our election infrastructure is chronically underfunded,” Mr. Norden said, although he noted that more money, private and public, had flowed to election planning in recent years.

In the 2018 midterm elections, voters cast ballots at about 230,871 polling places, where more than 637,000 poll workers — two-thirds of whom were older than 60 — signed them in, guided them to their ballots and counted their votes. That patchwork of election districts and poll workers makes mishaps impossible to avoid, experts said, but can also keep an incident at one polling place from affecting a broader region.

“The fact that we do fundamentally run elections by volunteer citizens in their local communities, that keeps a minor or even a major problem happening in one place from bringing down our democracy,” said Maggie Toulouse Oliver, the New Mexico secretary of state and president of the National Association of Secretaries of State.

This week saw a variety of such small-scale interruptions. In Atlanta, the culprit was leaky plumbing. Inside the arena where the Atlanta Hawks play basketball — converted into a polling place — the early-morning discovery that a burst pipe was leaking water into a room with absentee ballots delayed the count by a couple of hours. An arena staff member quickly fixed the leak, and none of the ballots were damaged, officials said.

Several polling places in Louisiana were running on generators after lingering power failures caused by Hurricane Zeta, which led to a feud between local and state officials over who was responsible for sending the generators to election sites. Officials ultimately moved two polling locations to a nearby middle school, and there were no serious delays.

In Hidalgo County in South Texas, just across the border from Mexico, it was a technical glitch. New laptops that had been distributed to polling sites ahead of Election Day to help accommodate the region’s record-breaking turnout did not work, causing delays of up to 90 minutes on Tuesday morning.

“They were not allowing the software program to open up to check in voters,” Yvonne Ramon, the county elections administrator, said. “And because they were scattered throughout the county, my field service technicians took off to the nearest locations. We’re a large county, so going from location to location is not an easy thing.”

Ms. Ramon noted that hiccups with new technology were not unusual. But the county kept polling places open an additional hour on Tuesday night to make up for the earlier delays, and everyone who had come out to cast a ballot was ultimately able to do so, she said.

In the battleground state of Wisconsin, the last few hundred votes went unreported for several hours because the Richland County clerk could not reach the clerk in the town of Willow, who had said she felt sick and then could not be reached, according to The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. Willow’s 274 votes were eventually reported. In Green Bay, the count of absentee votes was briefly delayed while an election official ran over to City Hall to get more ink for the vote-counting machines.

Poll workers face unexpected glitches every year, but warnings about distorted tallies or delayed counts made voters and observers more on edge than usual about any oddities. None of the complications this week led to serious problems, elections officials said. Some, like the hand sanitizer incident, were the result of an election severely altered by coronavirus precautions.

Until this year, “Hand sanitizer was never a thing at a polling place,” said Ms. Guilford, the official in Derry, where just over 18,000 people voted. The ballot that jammed the machine was ultimately hand counted, and the ballot reader was taken out of service, she said.

Hand sanitizer had tripped up other ballot machines in New Hampshire earlier this year, and on Tuesday in Iowa, requiring one of the machines to be fixed.

Daniel Healey, the town clerk in Derry, said election officials had done what they could to keep it from happening again, but that they could not stop everything.

“There was way less hand sanitizer this time,” he said, but some people brought their own. “There’s no way to stop it entirely.”

"Christopher Krebs Hasn’t Been Fired, Yet","WASHINGTON — Christopher Krebs is a 43-year-old former Microsoft executive who had the unenviable government job of protecting the nation’s election machinery from manipulation by Russia or other foreign hackers. It turns out, though, that some of the most dangerous interference has come not from the Kremlin but from the White House, where the president called the election “rigged” before a single vote was cast.

Mr. Krebs’s organization, the Department of Homeland Security’s new Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, has systematically shot down Mr. Trump’s false claims — that mail-in ballots would lead to extensive fraud and that voting machines were programmed to give votes to Joseph R. Biden Jr. — as part of its “rumor control” initiative to keep Americans from doubting the integrity of the election system.

To no one’s surprise, speculation swept through cybercircles in Washington on Thursday that Mr. Krebs was high on President Trump’s list of officials to be fired after his agency, known as CISA, released a statement from a government-led coordinating council saying that “there is no evidence” any voting systems were compromised and that the 2020 election “was the most secure in American history.” This occurred only hours after Mr. Trump had repeated a baseless report that a voting machine system had “deleted 2.7 million Trump votes nationwide.”

As of Friday night, Mr. Krebs was still employed, and still at his office, and shrugging it all off. As a father of five children, ages 2 through 10, he says he is used to living in chaos.

His department’s rumor control website, he said, was never devised with the president in mind. It was instead for “inoculating the American public” to make clear that even if there were fake websites created by the Russians and Iranians to stir up divisions before the election, “it wouldn’t mean that votes were affected, or tabulations were wrong.” A case in point: An Iranian effort to imitate the far-right Proud Boys was caught by American intelligence, and threatening emails the group had supposedly sent voters were debunked.

If anyone believed the warnings about false information posted on the website were about the president, he said, that was their interpretation. “We’ll stand up for all our work,” he said.

Few in the White House are buying it. In the West Wing, Mr. Krebs’s agency is regarded as a deep-state stronghold, an antagonist that has contradicted Mr. Trump’s false claims that fraud was rampant, software mistakes were vast and the election was stolen. It did not help that as Mr. Krebs gave speeches and interviews around the country about election security, he rarely, if ever, mentioned Mr. Trump’s name.

All of this has put Mr. Krebs in a highly public political standoff that he had no way to see when he started at the Department of Homeland Security as a contractor during its infancy in the George W. Bush administration.

He said his closest connection to computers growing up in Atlanta was Nintendo games. “I could wire stuff up,” he said, “but coding wasn’t really available” at his high school. He went on to the University of Virginia, where he was a pole-vaulter, and the George Mason University law school.

At homeland security, he worked in what was then called the National Protections and Programs Directorate, a predecessor bureaucracy in the days before protecting computer networks seemed central to the department’s mission.

He ended up as a political employee until President Barack Obama’s election sent him back to the private sector, at consulting companies and ultimately in Microsoft’s Washington office, where he directed cyberpolicy.

He joined as North Korea’s hacking of Sony was underway and developed a reputation for crisis management as one breach after another unfolded across American companies and government networks. Among the policies he worked on at Microsoft was a 2015 cybersecurity information act, which formalized the mechanism by which private companies like Microsoft could share threat intelligence with the federal government and vice versa. Lobbyists watered down the bill at every pass, but Mr. Krebs was determined to see it through.

Just after the 2018 midterm elections, Mr. Trump signed into law the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act, elevating a dedicated digital security agency in the Department of Homeland Security with more budget and resources. Mr. Krebs was named as director and charged with defending an election for a president who did not want to discuss what the Russians did in 2016 and helping states, including his native Georgia, that did not want federal help.

He has received high marks for his preparations for the election this year. “We had four years to prepare for the 2020 election, and that meant we had time to do threat models and figure out the potential actors who would enter the fray,” he said.

For two years, Mr. Krebs quietly assembled a team of deputies to travel the country offering help to secure state election machines, registration systems and polling procedures. Many states, particularly conservative-leaning ones, perceived any kind of federal assistance as its own kind of election interference.

Mr. Krebs and his team decided to pivot to handling ransomware — cyberattacks that hold data hostage until victims paid up. Throughout 2019, digital extortionists were holding up American cities, towns, counties and clerks, be it in Atlanta, Baltimore or small towns in Texas. Soon states and counties began signing up for help to safeguard their systems.

Mr. Krebs’s team worked with states to scan and patch systems for vulnerabilities, lock up voter registration databases and voter rolls, change default passwords, turn on two-factor authentication, and print out paper backups, all to build up “resilience” in case of attack. He was protecting, he said, “the crown jewels of election administration.”

When the pandemic upended everything, Mr. Krebs’s team shifted focus to securing vote-by-mail systems, despite the president’s campaign against them. That was when Mr. Krebs’s agency got in the White House’s cross hairs.

In interviews, Mr. Krebs countered Mr. Trump by saying mail-in voting would make the election more secure by creating a paper trail, critical for audits to establish that every legal ballot was correctly counted.

It also made state registration databases more critical: an attack that froze or sabotaged voter-registration data — by switching addresses, marking registered voters as unregistered or deleting voters entirely — risked mass digital disenfranchisement. Mr. Krebs made it his personal mission to see to it that every last registration database was sealed up.

When Mr. Trump called mail-in voting a “fraud” in his televised debate with Mr. Biden, now the president-elect, in September, Mr. Krebs contradicted the president at every turn, again without mentioning his name.

“We’ve got a lot of confidence that the ballot’s as secure as it’s ever been,” Mr. Krebs told any reporter who asked.

On Election Day, Mr. Krebs and senior officials held briefings with reporters every few hours to apprise them of any threats. Chad Wolf, the secretary of homeland security, a Trump loyalist and Mr. Krebs’s boss, even appeared at one to praise Mr. Krebs’s work. Despite small hiccups, Mr. Krebs reassured journalists that there was no major foreign interference or signs of systemic fraud.

“It’s just another Tuesday on the internet,” he said."
Could State Legislatures Pick Electors to Vote for Trump? Not Likely,"President Trump’s last-ditch efforts to reverse the election seem to come down to a far-fetched scenario, one in which Republican-led state legislatures choose the members of the Electoral College, overturning the will of voters.

Could it work? Election law experts are highly skeptical. And leaders of the Republican majorities in legislatures in key states, including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona and Georgia, told The New York Times this week through their offices that they saw no role for themselves in picking electors.

That has not stopped some high-profile supporters of the president, including the talk radio host Mark Levin and Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, from suggesting that Republican-led legislatures should consider ignoring the popular vote in close-fought states won by President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. and handing their electoral votes to Mr. Trump.

This political gambit, to the degree that it’s an organized strategy at all, has a theoretical basis in law, according to experts. But if it were to proceed, it could cause widespread outrage and be seen as an attempt to subvert the democratic process.

Benjamin Ginsberg, until recently one of the Republican Party’s top elections lawyers, called the strategy an act of desperation, one that many Republican lawmakers would not buy into. “The most partisan Trump legislators might, but I believe enough would rebel at hijacking their constituents’ votes that such actions would fail,” he said.

Here’s how such a scheme would theoretically play out. The Constitution gives state legislatures the power to determine the “manner” in which electors are appointed to the Electoral College, the body of 538 people who formally choose the president. Every state has already done that, by specifying in its laws that the winner of the statewide popular vote is entitled to the state’s presidential electors (Maine and Nebraska apportion some electors by congressional district).

The Electoral Count Act, a 19th-century law, sets up the mechanism for how that takes place. It directs governors to certify both the election results and a slate of presidential electors to represent the will of the people. In general practice, governors certify electors chosen by the party of the presidential candidate who won their state.

The Electoral Count Act also says that in the event of “failed elections,” in which voters have not made a choice for president, state legislatures are empowered to step in and appoint electors. The 1887 law is ambiguous about what constitutes a “failed” election. But the law does contain a deadline for states to certify elections: the “safe harbor” date, which this year is Dec. 8. Electors chosen before that date cannot be challenged by Congress.

A flurry of lawsuits filed by the Trump campaign, most of which have been defeated in court, appear aimed at slowing down states’ certification timelines and possibly providing a pretext to declare a “failed” election.

At the same time, election law experts said none of the lawsuits presented evidence of widespread fraud that could reverse Mr. Trump’s deficits. With Arizona and Georgia added to Mr. Biden’s column this week, he has comfortably won the election with 306 projected electoral votes, 36 more than needed for a majority.

Bob Bauer, a leading Democratic elections lawyer and senior adviser to the Biden campaign, dismissed the notion of legislatures picking electors. “When all is said and done, you can’t stop the process from coming to the inevitable conclusion,” he said.

The idea of legislatures intervening for Mr. Trump gained currency in the days after Election Day, following months of Mr. Trump’s raging that the election would be “rigged,” a baseless accusation, although one embraced by many of his supporters.

On Nov. 5, as Pennsylvania’s gradual counting of mail-in ballots eroded Mr. Trump’s edge in the votes cast on Election Day, the Fox News commentator Sean Hannity suggested the results should be invalidated. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a staunch Trump supporter, responded, “I think everything should be on the table.”

Earlier that day, Mr. Levin, the conservative radio host, had urged Republican state lawmakers to “get ready to do your constitutional duty,” writing in all capital letters on Twitter.

He was retweeted by the president’s son Donald Trump Jr. And Mr. DeSantis, the Florida governor, urged voters in Michigan and Pennsylvania, both with Republican-majority legislatures, to call lawmakers, who have it in their power to “provide remedies,” he said on Fox News.

Michigan’s attorney general, Dana Nessel, a Democrat, told reporters this week that it appeared the Trump lawsuits were aimed at stopping county and state boards from certifying the election, so that the Legislature could send “a faithless slate of electors” to support Mr. Trump.

A spokeswoman for Michigan’s Senate majority leader said that state law did not allow the Legislature to directly select electors or to award electors to anyone besides the winner of the popular vote. Mr. Biden won the state by nearly 150,000 votes.

In Pennsylvania, where Mr. Biden’s winning margin is currently more than 58,000 votes and the Trump campaign is in court asking for a delay in certifying the results, Republican leaders of the State Senate and House of Representatives said before Election Day that the General Assembly would have no role in choosing electors.

Pressed on the issue last week during a telephone news conference, Jake Corman, the Senate majority leader, said that “under normal circumstances,” the Legislature would have no role.

“Well, under any circumstances?” Mr. Corman was asked. He reiterated that Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, appoints electors, not lawmakers.

At the same time, Republicans in the Pennsylvania General Assembly moved to conduct a review of the election and asked the governor to delay certification of the results, which is unlikely.

In North Carolina, which news organizations said Mr. Trump had won on Friday, spokesmen for the Republican leaders of both chambers of the General Assembly said lawmakers would have no role in choosing electors. “State law outlines a legal process that has the political parties designate electors to be appointed by the governor,” said Patrick Ryan, a spokesman for Phil Berger, the State Senate’s president pro tem. “We anticipate that process will be followed this year just as it has in the past.”

In Arizona, Mike Philipsen, a spokesman for the Senate’s Republican leadership, citing an internal legal memo, said, “The Legislature cannot change the 2020 election results through changing the statutory selection process for presidential electors.” Mr. Biden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes.

And in Georgia, where officials agreed to a Trump campaign demand that they recount more than 4.9 million votes — an effort that most likely will cost taxpayers in the millions of dollars — officials showed no inclination to appease the Trump forces by disrupting the Electoral College system. Mr. Biden’s lead in Georgia is more than 14,000 votes, which news outlets deemed sufficient for victory on Friday.

An unusual joint statement Tuesday by Gov. Brian Kemp, Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan and House Speaker David Ralston — all Republicans — declined calls for a special legislative session on election issues.

“Any changes to Georgia’s election laws made in a special session will not have any impact on an ongoing election and would only result in endless litigation,” the statement said.

The Georgia General Assembly is not scheduled to convene until Jan. 11 — well after the electors meet in state capitols around the country to formally vote for president on Dec. 14."
Trump Forms PAC in Hopes of Keeping Hold on G.O.P.,"President Trump has formed a so-called leadership political action committee, a federal fund-raising vehicle that will potentially let him retain his hold on the Republican Party even after he leaves office.

The move comes just days after the major news networks and newspapers, as well as The Associated Press, called the 2020 election for President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.

Such committees can accept donations of up to $5,000 per donor per year — far less than the donation limits for the committees formed by Mr. Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee — but a leadership PAC could accept donations from an unlimited number of people. It could also accept donations from other political action committees.

A leadership PAC could spend an unlimited amount in so-called independent expenditures to benefit other candidates, as well as fund travel, polling and consultants. Mostly, it would almost certainly be a vehicle by which Mr. Trump could retain influence in a party that has been remade largely in his image over the past four years.

On Monday night, fund-raising solicitations from the Trump campaign revealed that 60 percent of donations would be directed to the new entity, “Save America.” 

A Trump campaign spokesman, Tim Murtaugh, said the committee had been in the works for a while.

“The president always planned to do this, win or lose,” Mr. Murtaugh said, “so he can support candidates and issues he cares about, such as combating voter fraud.”

Still, a PAC could give the president an off-ramp after a bruising election fight, as well as keep him as a dominant figure as the next Republican presidential primary races are beginning for a new standard-bearer.

“President Trump is not going anywhere anytime soon,” said Matt Gorman, a Republican strategist. “He’s going to insert himself in the national debate in a way that’s unlike any of his predecessors.”

Before the election, Mr. Trump told advisers, sometimes joking and other times not, that he might run again in 2024 if he lost to Mr. Biden.

Even as Mr. Biden has gathered more than the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win, and as he has taken leads of tens of thousands of votes in several battleground states, Mr. Trump has maintained there was voter fraud on a wide scale, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. He has directed his campaign to march forward with legal challenges in states like Arizona and Nevada, despite most advisers believing that the race is over and that he should move on.

But Mr. Trump’s personal brand as a businessman is now intertwined with his political brand. And he has made clear he is not ceding the stage easily, even as advisers say he will most likely willingly leave the White House when his term ends.

Since the 2020 race was called on Saturday, Mr. Trump has told advisers he is seriously considering running again in 2024 if the vote is certified for Mr. Biden, a development earlier reported by Axios.

While the leadership PAC could not help him in such an effort, it could provide an interim vehicle that would let him travel and engage in some political activity, even if he never actually runs again.

Trump Floats Improbable Survival Scenarios as He Ponders His Future,"At a meeting on Wednesday at the White House, President Trump had something he wanted to discuss with his advisers, many of whom have told him his chances of succeeding at changing the results of the 2020 election are thin as a reed.

He then proceeded to press them on whether Republican legislatures could pick pro-Trump electors in a handful of key states and deliver him the electoral votes he needs to change the math and give him a second term, according to people briefed on the discussion.

It was not a detailed conversation, or really a serious one, the people briefed on it said. Nor was it reflective of any obsessive desire of Mr. Trump’s to remain in the White House.

“He knows it’s over,” one adviser said. But instead of conceding, they said, he is floating one improbable scenario after another for staying in office while he contemplates his uncertain post-presidency future.

There is no grand strategy at play, according to interviews with a half-dozen advisers and people close to the president. Mr. Trump is simply trying to survive from one news cycle to the next, seeing how far he can push his case against his defeat and ensure the continued support of his Republican base.

By dominating the story of his exit from the White House, he hopes to keep his millions of supporters energized and engaged for whatever comes next.

The president has insisted to aides that he really defeated Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Nov. 3, but it is unclear whether he actually believes it. And instead of conducting discreet requests for recounts, Mr. Trump has made a series of spurious claims, seizing on conspiracies fanned on the internet.

The latest was on Thursday, when he falsely claimed on Twitter that Dominion voting machines switched hundreds of thousands of his votes to Mr. Biden, citing a report he had seen on the fringe network OANN, something even his supporters called ridiculous and a federal agency overseeing cybersecurity disavowed in a statement.

Advisers said his efforts were in keeping with one of his favorite pastimes: creating a controversy and watching to see how it plays out.

As a next step, Mr. Trump is talking seriously about announcing that he is planning to run again in 2024, aware that whether he actually does it or not, it will freeze an already-crowded field of possible Republican candidates. And, Republicans say, it will keep the wide support he showed even in defeat and could guarantee a lucrative book deal or speaking fees.

In the meantime, Mr. Trump has spent his days toggling between his White House residence and the Oval Office, watching television coverage about the final weeks of his presidency. His mood is often bleak, advisers say, though he is not raising his voice in anger, despite the impression left by his tweets, which are often in capital letters.

But the work of government has been reduced to something of a sideshow for the president. He has not made any public appearances except for a visit to Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day since an angry statement a week ago.

And he has not spoken about the coronavirus pandemic or mentioned it on Twitter despite the staggering growth in positive cases and the number of West Wing aides and outside advisers who have been diagnosed with the virus in the past week.

Several advisers have bluntly told Mr. Trump that the chances of changing the election’s outcome are almost nonexistent, including in a meeting with him on Saturday at the White House to which the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, dispatched aides, even as he has generally backed Mr. Trump’s desire to keep fighting.

While most Republicans have declined to publicly oppose the president, more have become vocal that the time has come, amid the growing pandemic, to allow a transition to take place.

“Look, I’m worried about this virus. I’m not looking at what the merits of the case are,” said Gov. Mike DeWine, Republican of Ohio, about Mr. Trump’s lawsuits in an appearance on Thursday on CNN. “It would appear that Joe Biden is going to be the next president of the United States.”

Karl Rove, the architect of President George W. Bush’s presidency and an informal adviser to Mr. Trump, wrote in The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that “closing out this election will be a hard but necessary step toward restoring some unity and political equilibrium.”

He added that after Mr. Trump’s “days in court are over, the president should do his part to unite the country by leading a peaceful transition and letting grievances go.”

A peaceful transition is not as much on Mr. Trump’s mind right now as settling scores both inside and outside the administration.

White House advisers have sent warnings to any government employees who might be looking for other jobs, have placed loyalists in the upper ranks of the Pentagon, and have been open to calls for intelligence officials to declassify documents related to the investigation into a possible conspiracy between the Trump campaign in 2016 and Russian officials.

And the president is considering firing the C.I.A. director, Gina Haspel, although some administration officials said he may not go through with it.

The president has nursed a burning anger at Fox News for calling Arizona for Mr. Biden on election night, and has entertained suggestions from allies to start some kind of competing conservative-leaning news network, whether by trying to join forces with an existing property like OANN or Newsmax, or forming a digital network of his own, as Axios reported. (The New York Times called Arizona for Mr. Biden late Thursday.)

In a tweet on Thursday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on his once loyal supporters, declaring falsely that Fox News’s “daytime ratings have completely collapsed.”

“Weekend daytime even WORSE,” he added. “Very sad to watch this happen, but they forgot what made them successful, what got them there. They forgot the Golden Goose. The biggest difference between the 2016 Election, and 2020, was @FoxNews!”

Several Republicans expressed doubt on Thursday that Mr. Trump would ever be able to put together anything that could overtake Fox.

And allies acknowledge that he could not do both a presidential campaign and create a news network at the same time, and they questioned whether he would keep up his animus toward Fox if it were to offer him a lucrative contributor deal once he is out of office.

Some advisers had hoped that Mr. Trump would accept the state of the race by the end of this week, but a looming recount in Georgia may delay that. The president has told some advisers that if the race is certified for Mr. Biden, he will announce a 2024 campaign shortly afterward.

The president’s goal for now is to delay certification of the election results, a process that has begun in some states. But his approach to lawsuits aimed at delaying that certification has been as scattered as his own thinking about the future.

Advisers say there may be additional lawsuits filed, but it is not entirely clear when. It also is not clear who is leading the legal efforts.

Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, has been a source of enormous frustration for Trump advisers. Advisers have tried to tell Mr. Trump that the fraud Mr. Giuliani is offering hope of proving simply does not exist.

Mr. Trump is getting suggestions from an array of other lawyers, as well. They include Sidney Powell, the lawyer for his former national security adviser Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who was at the Trump campaign headquarters over the weekend.

Advisers have nudged the president to stop talking about “fraud” because that has legal implications that his team has not been able to back up. So Mr. Trump has taken to pronouncing the election “rigged,” one of his favorite words but one with dangerous implications in terms of how his own supporters view the election’s ultimate outcome."
"For Pence, the Future Is Tied to Trump as Much as the Present Is","WASHINGTON — For four years, Vice President Mike Pence has walked the Trump tight rope more successfully than anyone else in the president’s orbit, staying on his good side without having to echo his most incendiary rhetoric.

But in the final weeks of Mr. Pence’s term, his relationship with President Trump is facing what may be the vice president’s toughest challenge yet.

Mr. Pence must now balance his loyalty to an enraged president making baseless claims of voter fraud against his own political future and reputation. He also has to deal with how Mr. Trump’s talk of running for president again in 2024 could leave him with no lane to run in. It also makes it difficult for Mr. Pence to even start raising money if the president is floating his own name.

So far, Mr. Pence appears to be handling the pressure much as he has over the past four years: appearing to be unflinchingly loyal while also steering clear of engaging in Mr. Trump’s pressure campaigns.

In the last few months of Mr. Pence’s time as vice president, his advisers want him focused on leading the coronavirus task force and helping the two Georgia Republicans facing runoffs that will determine whether the party maintains its Senate majority.

Those advisers said they would prefer that the vice president steer clear of the Trump campaign’s legal fights contesting the election results, and so far, Mr. Pence has been careful not to repeat Mr. Trump’s most baseless attacks on the electoral system while simultaneously remaining the good soldier.

In his brief remarks early Wednesday morning after election night — he kept them to 53 seconds — Mr. Pence tried to make what amounted to a non-endorsement of the president’s claim that the election was a “major fraud on our nation” into something that sounded like unquestioning support.

“As the votes continue to be counted, we’re going to remain vigilant, as the president said,” Mr. Pence told the crowd. “We’re going to protect the integrity of the vote.”

For almost a week afterward Mr. Pence was not seen or heard in public, though it was reported that he spent time with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office on Friday.

Then on Tuesday, he spoke to Republican senators at their weekly lunch, continuing his somewhat restrained tone while giving an update on where the campaign’s lawsuits stood and thanking senators for supporting Mr. Trump without making any demand that they fall in line, according to two people who attended the meeting.

Mr. Pence told the lawmakers he planned to travel to Georgia on Nov. 20 to campaign for Republican senators in the two runoff elections. He joked that he considered himself an honorary Iowan because of all the time he had spent campaigning for Senator Joni Ernst, a seeming wink to his own presidential ambitions, which would most likely run through Iowa.

But in the same kind of nod to Mr. Trump’s claim for a second term that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made the same day, he also told the senators that he wanted to keep serving with them, as the president of the Senate, and that he thought he would.

In reality, Mr. Pence’s allies expect him to return to Indiana and make a living giving paid speeches and potentially writing a book. It will be the first time in a long time that Mr. Pence will live as a private citizen — he moved from the governor’s mansion in Indiana to temporary housing in Washington during the presidential transition four years ago to the Naval Observatory. He currently does not own a house.

But before he starts to think about what kind of house he will live in, and how to fill the years before the 2024 election cycle, he still has a role to play in the end of the 2020 election.

Mr. Pence has already faced an array of tests publicly and privately since Election Day, as he has had to calculate how far to go in supporting the president’s attempts to overturn the election.

In one of the most glaring examples, Corey Lewandowski, a Trump ally, pushed for Mr. Pence to travel to the Pennsylvania Convention Center last week to observe votes being counted, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The image of the vice president — who has strong support with the social-conservative wing of the Republican Party — descending on a counting center in a state where Mr. Trump’s campaign was making baseless claims of widespread fraud would have aided the president’s narrative that the election was being stolen. Mr. Pence’s chief of staff, Marc Short, vetoed the request, the person said.

The furthest he has gone, rhetorically, is lending his name to campaign fund-raising emails that warn of “DEFENDING the Election from voter fraud.”

A campaign spokeswoman described his efforts on behalf of the president more effusively.

“Vice President Pence has been in constant contact with our team and extremely involved in the campaign’s legal efforts, doing everything we and the president have asked of him as well as leading efforts to raise money for the legal fund,” the spokeswoman, Ali Pardo, said in a statement.

But in his role as president of the Senate, Mr. Pence has a constitutionally designated role that could be a coda to Mr. Trump’s insistence that he won re-election — and awkward for the loyal vice president. 

The Constitution calls on the vice president to oversee a joint session of Congress, to be held this time on Jan. 6, in which the votes from the Electoral College are officially counted. Typically, vice presidents simply read from a script and take no actions to interfere with the results.

In 2000, Vice President Al Gore had to certify the disputed election results after the Supreme Court effectively handed the presidential election to his opponent, George W. Bush.

“It was awkward and difficult for Vice President Al Gore in 2000, but that was his job,” recalled Michael Feldman, Mr. Gore’s former chief of staff. “The vice president has very few jobs as prescribed by the Constitution. Presiding over that process as president of the Senate is one of them.”

For Mr. Pence, the day he will have to announce Mr. Trump’s defeat is two months away. In the meantime, he has resumed more traditional duties of the job, appearing with the president on Wednesday at a Veterans Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. And he postponed a family vacation to Florida, opting instead for a speaking engagement on Friday."
Secret Service Struck Again by Coronavirus Outbreak,"WASHINGTON — The Secret Service’s Uniformed Division has sustained a coronavirus outbreak, according to four people briefed on the matter, the latest blow to a beleaguered agency that has faced challenges in performing its duties during the pandemic.

The outbreak is at least the fourth to strike the agency since the pandemic began, further hobbling its staffing as it continues to provide full protection to President Trump and prepares for the number of people it is charged with protecting to grow because of the election of Joseph R. Biden Jr.

At least 30 uniformed Secret Service officers tested positive in recent weeks for the virus, and the agency asked about another 60 to quarantine, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be identified discussing personnel matters. At least a handful of agents also tested positive or were forced to isolate, two of the people said.

The Washington Post first reported the outbreak.

It was unclear how the officers contracted the virus. Many traveled to Trump or Biden campaign events in the final weeks of the election, the people said. Several senior White House officials and Trump allies also contracted the virus after attending an election night party at the White House.

A spokeswoman said the Secret Service kept up its duties during the campaign season and that it was taking precautions, including testing, contact tracing and isolating people as needed, to respond to Covid-19.

“The health and safety of our work force is paramount,” said the spokeswoman, Julia McMurray.

Officers in the Uniformed Division have different responsibilities from the famed Secret Service agents who guard presidents and their families. The officers provide protection for physical locations like the White House and the vice president’s home at the Naval Observatory in Washington. They also screen crowds at public events. The division — which has 1,600 officers — was widely faulted after fence jumpers breached the White House grounds during former President Barack Obama’s second term.

Many officers and agents privately expressed concerns in the final weeks of the presidential race about traveling to campaign events across the country. They feared contracting the virus at the events or while traveling, according to two people briefed on the matter.

The pandemic has been particularly taxing on law enforcement agencies whose officers come in direct contact with people to do their work. In the first few months of the outbreak, one in six New York Police Department officers were out sick or on quarantine.

The pandemic has created unique problems for the Secret Service as the nature of its work — especially during a presidential campaign — forces the agency to deploy its agents across the country, including to events held by Mr. Trump where social distancing was rarely practiced and wearing masks was not required.

In the most glaring example of the dangers agents faced, Mr. Trump held a rally in June at an indoor arena in Tulsa, Okla. One of Mr. Trump’s allies who attended the event, Herman Cain, died from the virus six weeks after the rally.

In August, at least 11 employees at the Secret Service’s training facility in Maryland tested positive for the virus. The agency had shuttered the facility earlier in the year to develop procedures to mitigate transmission of the coronavirus. But several trainees were believed to have contracted the virus during training exercises and at a nearby hotel where they practiced no social distancing.

Earlier in the summer, two members of the Secret Service who were dispatched to provide security at the Tulsa rally tested positive. Around that time, Vice President Mike Pence canceled a trip to Florida after members of his detail showed symptoms of the virus.

The latest outbreak comes at a time when the Secret Service’s resources are already stretched. During a transition, the agency is expected to provide more protection for the president-elect and vice president-elect and their families while continuing its regular duties of protecting the president and his family.

During his hospitalization for the coronavirus in October, Mr. Trump had an agent drive him past a group of supporters outside the hospital. Medical experts said Mr. Trump was likely contagious at the time and that the agents who were in a hermetically sealed Chevy Suburban with him could have easily been infected, even though they were covered in the same kind of personal protective equipment used by medical professionals.

"Georgia Will Begin Recounting Votes, With Biden Still Favored","Georgia’s 159 counties were poised on Thursday to begin recounting nearly five million ballots in the presidential election, but confusion surrounded the proceedings even as county officials raced to get ready.

A day after Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, described the process as a hand recount, his subordinates said Thursday that it was technically an audit and not a recount, though it would have largely the same effect. Counties are being told to audit every vote cast and tally a new result by midnight on Wednesday, two days before the state’s Nov. 20 deadline to certify its results.

But after that, the Trump campaign can still request an official recount, if the result is within half a percentage point. That means President Trump could effectively get three bites at the apple — or the peach, as it were — in Georgia. Still, with the margin in the first tally giving Joseph R. Biden Jr. an edge of more than 14,000 votes, election observers do not believe any number of counts will alter the outcome.

Counties will begin their audits on Friday morning and are required to finish up by midnight on Nov. 18. Auditors from the counties’ elections divisions will sit at tables and count the ballots.

Most of what will be reviewed will be straightforward: printed copies of in-person votes cast on electronic machines. But county officials will also review absentee ballots marked by hand. If they find ambiguities, the ballots will be referred to a three-person adjudication panel in each county made up of a Democratic representative, a Republican representative and a county official who will break ties.

The situation in Georgia grew more complicated on Thursday when Mr. Raffensperger went into quarantine after his wife tested positive for the coronavirus; as of Thursday afternoon she was planning to take a second test. Jordan Fuchs, a deputy secretary of state, said that Mr. Raffensperger and several of his senior staff members also planned to get tested on Thursday.

The state’s use of an audit to re-tally all of the votes that were cast is unusual, though the secretary of state’s office believes it has the legal authority to do so. Audits are typically carried out for a portion of the vote to verify the results.

“This will be the largest hand re-tallying by an audit in the history of the United States,” Gabriel Sterling, a top deputy in the secretary of state’s office, said at a news conference on Thursday. “We understand that. It is a heavy lift.”

Critics questioned the move.

“If they are saying that this is the audit, the law does not permit them to take audit results and make them official,” said Marilyn Marks, the director of the Coalition for Good Governance, a voting rights group. “Clearly, the secretary is responding to political pressures rather than following the intent of the law.”

Paige Hill, a spokeswoman for the Biden campaign, said in a statement that “historically only races with exceptionally close margins have any likelihood of being overturned,” adding: “President-elect Biden’s margin is now at more than 14,000 votes. At the end of this hand recount process, we are confident the Election Day result will be reaffirmed: Georgians have selected Joe Biden as their next commander in chief.”

Mr. Raffensperger’s office has come under considerable pressure. He initiated the audit after Mr. Trump’s campaign demanded a hand recount. Georgia’s two senators, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, who are both fellow Republicans, also called on Mr. Raffensperger to resign this week, under pressure from Mr. Trump. The president and his campaign are spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories about the election, falsely claiming that it was rigged.

Mr. Sterling addressed some of the conspiracy theories on Thursday.

“I know that there’s many other bits of misinformation out there, talking about flipping votes and changing votes,” he said. “Anybody claiming that things are being flipped by a super secret computer developed by the C.I.A. is just not speaking — is speaking nonsense.”

He also said the news media had “mischaracterized the rationale behind” the audit “as caving to Trump and their campaign,” saying, “There’s nothing that could be further from the truth.”"
Federal Prosecutors Push Back on Barr Memo on Voter Fraud Claims,"WASHINGTON — Career Justice Department prosecutors pushed back this week against a memo by Attorney General William P. Barr that opened the door to politically charged election fraud investigations, saying in a pair of messages that Mr. Barr thrust the department into politics and falsely overstated the threat of voter fraud.

The protests were the latest rebuke of Mr. Barr by his own employees, who have in recent months begun criticizing his leadership both privately and publicly. They argued that Mr. Barr has worked to advance President Trump’s interests by wielding the power of the department to shield his allies and attack his enemies.

On Friday, 16 federal prosecutors across the country who were assigned to monitor elections for signs of fraud wrote to Mr. Barr that they had found no evidence of “substantial allegations of voting and vote tabulation irregularities.” They also asked him to rescind the memo, saying it thrust the department into partisan politics and was unnecessary because no one has identified any legitimate suspicions of mass voter fraud.

The memo “is not based in fact,” the monitors wrote.

Issued Monday amid the president’s efforts to falsely claim widespread voter fraud, the memo allows prosecutors to investigate “substantial allegations” of fraud before the results of the presidential race are certified, disregarding longstanding department policies intended to keep law enforcement investigations from affecting the outcome of an election.

“It was developed and announced without consulting nonpartisan career professionals in the field and at the department,” the prosecutors wrote of the memo. “The timing of the memorandum’s release thrusts career prosecutors into partisan politics.” The Washington Post earlier reported their letter.

On Thursday, a top career prosecutor in the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington said in an email sent to Mr. Barr via Richard P. Donoghue, an official in the deputy attorney general’s office, that the memo should be rescinded because it went against longstanding practices, according to two people with knowledge of the email.

The prosecutor, J.P. Cooney, also said that the fact that Richard Pilger, a longtime department employee who oversees election fraud crimes, chose to step down from that position over the memo was deeply concerning, the people said.

In response, Mr. Donoghue told Mr. Cooney that he would pass on his complaint but that if it leaked to reporters, he would note that as well. Given that the email was born out of a concern for integrity, Mr. Donoghue said in his reply that he would assure officials “that I have a high degree of confidence that it will not be improperly leaked to the media.”

A department spokeswoman declined to comment about Mr. Cooney’s message. Asked about the prosecutors’ letter to Mr. Barr, she said that his memo directed prosecutors to “exercise appropriate caution and maintain the department’s absolute commitment to fairness, neutrality and nonpartisanship.”

Others inside the department pointed out that Mr. Barr’s memo was carefully worded and contained caveats that made it unlikely that a prosecutor could meet the threshold to open a case and begin investigating.

“Specious, speculative, fanciful or far-fetched claims should not be a basis for initiating federal inquiries,” Mr. Barr wrote in his memo. “Nothing here should be taken as any indication that the department has concluded that voting irregularities have impacted the outcome of any election.”

Department lawyers often engage in heated debates over policies, investigations and prosecutions, but they rarely put their criticisms in writing and then send them to top officials.

But Mr. Barr’s memo churned up rancor among prosecutors who work on election fraud, in large part because Mr. Trump himself was making false claims about widespread voter fraud. Even the specter of such an investigation into votes for the presidential race could shade the integrity of the election.

Mr. Pilger, the prosecutor who oversees election fraud at the department’s headquarters in Washington, stepped down from his supervisory role in protest a few hours after it was issued; and other lawyers affected by the memo began to devise plans for how to push back on Mr. Barr’s authorization and what to do should a U.S. attorney announce an election-related investigation, according to three people with knowledge of these discussions.

Even as the department’s officials and career prosecutors argued about the memo, Mr. Trump’s legal cases related to the election began to unravel on Friday. A state judge in Michigan rejected an attempt by Republicans to halt the certification of the vote in Wayne County, which includes Detroit, pending an audit. And lawyers for Mr. Trump withdrew election-related lawsuits in Pennsylvania and Arizona."
Small Cracks Emerge in G.O.P. Support for Trump’s Baseless Fraud Claims,"The first small cracks have begun to appear in the Republican wall of support for President Trump and his unfounded claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election, with a growing number of elected officials and party leaders signaling on Thursday that they would indulge Mr. Trump’s conspiracy theories for only so long. A few were willing to openly contradict him.

Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio said that it was time to call Joseph R. Biden Jr. the “president-elect.” The Republican attorney general of Arizona said that Mr. Trump would not end up winning his state, despite the president’s protestations. And on Capitol Hill, several Republican senators have begun, in measured tones, to say that Mr. Biden should be entitled to classified intelligence briefings as the incoming commander in chief or that it is time to recognize he will soon be certified as president-elect.

Asked when he believed Mr. Trump should accept the result, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, even set a deadline for the president to acknowledge reality: Dec. 13 — the day before the Electoral College delegations cast their votes for president.

Influential party financiers and strategists have begun to weigh in, as well.

“The president does a disservice to his more rabid supporters by insisting that he would have won the Nov. 3 election absent voter fraud,” said an editorial in The Las Vegas Review-Journal, a newspaper owned by the family of the Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson. “That’s simply false.” Mr. Adelson and his wife, Miriam, have given more than $75 million to super PACs supporting Mr. Trump.

Karl Rove, the Republican strategist, published a Wall Street Journal op-ed essay under the headline, “This Election Result Won’t Be Overturned.”

Mr. Trump has a long memory, a penchant for seeking revenge on those who cross him and overwhelming support among the base of Republican voters. The fact that so few prominent Republicans are willing to break publicly with him, even in defeat, is the latest sign of his enduring hold on the Republican Party — now and into the future.

“When you look at the number of votes that he got, you look at the kind of enthusiasm that he engenders, I mean — he’s going to be a very, very significant figure whether he’s in the White House or not,” said Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri. “I don’t know who else would be considered the leader, if not for him.”

No prominent potential Republican candidate for president in 2024 — including Mr. Hawley — has criticized Mr. Trump for his refusal to acquiesce to the transition of power. Most have stayed silent or given Mr. Trump, who has spoken privately about running again in four years, latitude and support without parroting his most baseless conspiracies. Vice President Mike Pence, who followed Mr. Trump to the lectern on election night, tried to sound as if he was standing firmly with the president without echoing his false claims of victory.

But with Mr. Biden now leading in enough states to deliver him as many as 306 Electoral College votes — the same sum Mr. Trump won in 2016 and declared a “landslide” — and with no credible evidence of electoral malfeasance, Republicans are gingerly beginning to acknowledge the reality of Mr. Biden’s win. The former vice president leads by more than 20,000 votes in Wisconsin, 53,000 in Pennsylvania and 148,000 in Michigan — comparable to or larger than Mr. Trump’s winning margins in those states four years ago. And in the popular vote, Mr. Biden is now ahead by more than five million votes. 

“There is an inevitable logic to this,” said Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary under President George W. Bush, who has congratulated Mr. Biden on his win on Fox News. “None of these recounts and allegations are going to turn this election around.”

Democrats argue that indulging Mr. Trump’s recalcitrance is undercutting faith in the nation’s democratic institutions and undermining the incoming Biden administration’s legitimacy.

Former President Obama called it a “dangerous path” in an interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes,” according to excerpts released Thursday. He said he was troubled that “Republican officials who clearly know better are going along with this.”

On Thursday, the president made new baseless accusations about a voting software company. Groups representing government election and security officials, including in the Trump administration, as well as private sector election vendors, issued a joint statement declaring, “There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.”

Mr. Trump’s strategy is a familiar one that he has deployed since the first full day of his administration. Then, he demanded that his press secretary, Sean Spicer, march out to the White House Briefing Room to declare his inauguration crowd was the largest in history, despite clear evidence to the contrary. Now, he wants Republicans to ignore the election results to declare him the 2020 winner anyway.

When Secretary of State Mike Pompeo predicted earlier this week, with a grin, that there would be “a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,” Mr. Trump favorably reposted the video on Twitter.

The political and rhetorical safe space that many Republicans have retreated to is a call to “count every legal vote,” insinuating there was a raft of illegal ballots that no evidence has shown exist. (There are also more extreme Democratic fears of G.O.P. state legislatures appointing rogue electors who might ignore the results in their states, but Mr. Biden’s campaign has been dismissive of such talk.)

For now, Senate Republicans are especially leery of crossing Mr. Trump before the two Georgia runoffs on Jan. 5 that will determine control of the chamber, realizing they must mobilize Mr. Trump’s base without him on the ballot. There are fears that Mr. Trump might attack either Senator Kelly Loeffler or Senator David Perdue for being insufficiently loyal.

Both senators signed an unusual joint statement calling for the resignation of the Republican secretary of state in Georgia, a move widely interpreted as currying Mr. Trump’s favor. 

“It’s pretty clear that the president doesn’t give a damn about the Senate majority or those two senators, so they know it would not be anything to turn on them and crush turnout,” said Brendan Buck, who served as a top adviser to the last two Republican House speakers, Paul D. Ryan and John A. Boehner. “We’ve always been talking about how the president has taken over the party. But here is an example where is he holding base G.O.P. voters hostage to force Republicans to participate in his charade.”

Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said Republican fealty to Mr. Trump revealed that the party was “now a full-on cult of personality.”

“I think they understand that Trump will continue to dominate their politics for the next decade and they’ve all made a decision that they can’t survive personally if they get crosswise with him,” he said. “That’s a devastating development for our country.”

Mr. Murphy said undermining the legitimacy of Mr. Biden’s win had real-world consequences. “If there is a lingering belief among 40 percent of the country that Joe Biden’s election was fraudulent, it does make it very hard to do even the nonpartisan things, like distribute a vaccine,” he said.

The Trump campaign continues to bombard supporters with urgent requests for cash for his “election defense fund,” but the fine print of those appeals shows that the president is actually looking ahead to his own future, collecting cash primarily for a new political action committee, not an account devoted to legal and recount expenses. The first 60 percent of every donation goes to Mr. Trump’s new PAC, Save America, and 40 percent goes to the Republican National Committee.

Only after the PAC gets $5,000 from an individual would any money wind up in the Trump recount fund.

Bob Bauer, a top lawyer for Mr. Biden, has dismissed Mr. Trump’s legal filings and tweets as “theater.” As Mr. Trump continues to whip up fears of a stolen election, even some aides and allies privately acknowledge that Mr. Trump has lost.

The reality is that Mr. Trump is not just the president but also a major publisher and distributor. In the week after the election, his postings dominated Facebook, accounting for the 10 most engaged status updates in the United States, and 22 of the top 25. “I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!” was his top post.

Mr. Trump also posted the most engaged link on Facebook that week, a solicitation for cash to fight the election results.

Inside the Republican Party, the president remains a singular influence. He effectively anointed Ronna McDaniel for another term as chair of the Republican National Committee with a tweet this week.

Several R.N.C. members echoed Mr. Trump’s fraud claims on Thursday.

“It is possible the true winner will never be known,” said Rob Steele, an R.N.C. member from Michigan, where some Republican lawmakers are demanding a “thorough audit” of the election.

Most were happy to hold off recognizing Mr. Biden as the president-elect until Dec. 14 — if then.

“Parties always belong to the last presidential nominee until the next presidential nominee comes along,” said Mr. Fleischer, the former White House press secretary. “It will not be Donald Trump’s party once Republicans have a new nominee in 2024.”

“Unless,” he added, “it’s Donald Trump.”

Can Trump still win? No. He’s already lost.,"Five days after television networks and other major news organizations called the presidential election for Joseph R. Biden Jr., President Trump continues to maintain that he “will win.”

That is false.

Mr. Biden’s winning margins in the key battleground states he has captured — 20,000 votes in Wisconsin, 54,000 votes in Pennsylvania and 148,000 votes in Michigan — are well above the thresholds of votes that have been changed in previous recounts.

Even in Georgia, where officials are preparing for a hand recount of the ballots, Mr. Biden leads by 14,000 votes, a margin that is unlikely to be reversed.

(Mr. Biden also leads by 11,000 votes in Arizona, but elections officials there are still counting absentee votes that arrived by mail.)

The New York Times and other news media outlets have not anointed Mr. Biden the winner of the presidential election, but have just done the math: The former vice president has won enough states by enough votes that Mr. Trump cannot overcome those deficits through legal challenges or recounts.

“He has no chance of overturning the result — it’s just impossible,” said Gerry McDonough, a Democratic elections lawyer who worked for Vice President Al Gore’s legal team on the 2000 Florida recount. “I’m a recount lawyer here in Massachusetts and I get requests from people all the time and they say, ‘I’m just 50 votes behind and we’re sure there were these bad actors.’ I won’t take a case like that.”

That 2000 Florida recount came after George W. Bush held an unofficial lead of just 1,784 votes over Mr. Gore the morning after Election Day; his final winning margin in the state was 537 votes.

The largest margin to be overturned in a recent recount came in Minnesota’s 2008 Senate contest, when a 215-vote margin for Senator Norm Coleman, the incumbent Republican, was reversed, becoming a 312-vote advantage for Al Franken, the Democratic candidate, after a court ruled that hundreds of absentee ballots were wrongly rejected.

In the days since the election, Mr. Trump and his top aides and some supporters have claimed that the vote in key states was marked by rampant fraud, but they have yet to document any evidence of widespread voting malfeasance. Elections officials in all 50 states told The New York Times this week that they were unaware of any fraud or other election improprieties in their states.

Each day that passes without Mr. Trump providing a court evidence of voting fraud makes his legal odds longer, Democratic and Republican lawyers said.

“The path for him winning is being able to back up his rhetoric and find sufficient fraud and irregularities in enough individual states to overturn their results,” said Ben Ginsberg, a Republican lawyer who worked for Mr. Bush in the 2000 election, and who retired this year and turned against Mr. Trump. “So far, they’ve utterly failed to do that and, based on their court filings, are not anywhere close.”

With no chance to change the popular vote outcome in battleground states, lawyers said Mr. Trump’s legal strategy, such as there is one, appeared to be an attempt to delay state elections officials’ certification of Mr. Biden as the winner, which could throw the question of appointing members of the Electoral College to Republican-controlled state legislatures.

Even this theory relies on a series of one-in-a-hundred legal bank shots all being successful in multiple states simultaneously — which would certainly result in broad public outrage over reversing the results of a decided election.

“Those are the kind of things you wake up thinking about in the middle of the night. It would really blow the roof off if they tried to steal an election in that fashion,” Mr. McDonough said. “If people were to so blatantly disregard the fundamentals of democracy, God knows what would happen, how people would react to it.”

Most states are set to certify their election results and declare winners by the end of November — a process that may lead to more official recounts this month but also formal conclusions about the results.

“At some point it becomes obvious even to the most ardent supporters of the president that there’s no pathway,” said Lanhee Chen, who was the policy director for Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign."
Examine Ballot. Recite Name. Sort Into Bin. Repeat 5 Million Times.,"MARIETTA, Ga. — By the time President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. was declared the winner of Georgia’s 16 electoral votes on Friday afternoon, hundreds of county poll workers across the state were several hours into the arduous slog of recounting nearly five million ballots by hand.

Sitting several feet apart to account for social distancing, the workers began the extraordinary statewide effort, technically an audit, on Friday morning. They hunched over sheafs of ballots, recited the names, counted and restacked them in bins.

Similar scenes unfolded in warehouse-like rooms across the state, and would continue until every ballot had been checked.

“We’re pretty much living here right now,” said Deidre Holden, elections and voter registration supervisor in Paulding County, a suburban and rural area west of Atlanta.

Georgia was called for Mr. Biden at 2:21 p.m., extending his final electoral vote tally to 306 — 36 more than required to win the presidency. Still, the political pressure on elections officials was palpable in a freshly minted battleground state that President Trump, who trails Mr. Biden by about 14,000 votes, has vowed he would eventually win.

The workers were facing a tight deadline. Local officials must submit their new counts by Wednesday night, two days before the statewide certification deadline of Nov. 20. Elections officials had already put in long hours preparing for the recount, and they expected many more long days ahead — particularly as they prepare for the Dec. 14 start of early voting in two high-profile runoff elections that could determine control of the Senate.

Some of Georgia’s 159 counties, including Fulton and DeKalb Counties, two of the state’s most populous, were not scheduled to begin the recount until Saturday.

On Friday afternoon, Walter Jones, a spokesman for the secretary of state’s office, said few problems had surfaced in the counties that began counting that morning. Bryan County, near Savannah, finished its recount of 21,000 ballots, he said.

The audit was ordered this week by Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, after the Trump campaign and the state’s Republican Party demanded a hand recount after claiming that ineligible and dead people had voted.

Mr. Raffensperger, a Republican, has said that while his office would investigate all allegations of voting irregularities, the overall process had been fair, trustworthy and legitimate.

The Trump campaign can request a third tally — a formal recount — if Mr. Biden’s lead is less than half a percentage point. As of Friday afternoon, he was ahead by 0.3 percentage points.

In the Atlanta suburb of Cobb County, which Mr. Biden won by about 56,000 votes, the work got underway at 9 a.m. sharp in a cavernous room inside an event center. There, a county employee, pacing among the folding tables, barked out instructions like a high school teacher before a standardized test.

At each table, workers broke open taped-up boxes and removed fat stacks of ballots sealed in clear plastic bags. At Team 12’s table, a man held a sheaf of ballots, declared the name of the candidate on each one, and handed it to a woman standing across the table who double-checked him, then placed the ballot in a bin with the candidate’s name.

The Cobb County ballots being counted on Friday morning had been cast on Election Day and at early-voting sites using a touch-screen system that produces a paper printout and seldom yields ambiguous results.

Later in the day, said Janine Eveler, the director of elections and registration for Cobb County, the workers would move on to hand-marked absentee ballots, which take more time because of potential issues that need to be closely examined.

But Ms. Eveler said that in Cobb County, ballots deemed to have potential issues in the first counting — about five or six boxes’ worth — had already been separated and adjudicated once, making it unlikely that significant numbers of votes would change in the recount.

Any ambiguous ballots, including the batch that was already adjudicated, would be sent to a panel composed of a Democrat, a Republican and a representative from the county election board. That panel is scheduled to meet publicly on Saturday.

All of Georgia’s 159 counties rely on such panels to resolve issues of ambiguous voter intentions.

A little more than three hours after Cobb County began its recount, its election board certified the results based on the original count. And yet the workers recounted anyway. Ms. Eveler said the total would be recertified if it changed.

Similar scenes played out across the state.

In suburban Gwinnett County, the audit was conducted in a large room in the back of the elections office. Near the main entrance, black ballot boxes were lined up in five rows, ready to be distributed among 60 white tables spaced around the room.

The morning went smoothly — for the most part. At around 11 a.m., one of the workers was given a warning for taking out a phone, potentially violating a rule against taking pictures of the ballots. The worker received a warning. The counting continued.

In Paulding County, a deeply conservative area that went heavily for Mr. Trump, 42 workers paired up around 21 tables in a government office. Most of the workers were not wearing masks even though coronavirus cases are once again rising in the state.

By around 3 p.m., Ms. Holden said, about a quarter of the county’s 85,600 ballots had been recounted. Roughly 50 ballots had been flagged for review by a bipartisan adjudication panel, but in each case, she said, the Democrat and Republican agreed on the voter’s intent.

Who Needs a Call From Your Opponent When the Pope Is on the Phone?,"WASHINGTON — Joseph R. Biden Jr. ran for president insisting that President Trump was an “aberration” who did not reflect the character or views of the American people.

And in his first week as president-elect, Mr. Biden’s remarks and activities suggest an effort to dismiss Mr. Trump further: this time, as a nuisance.

As he refuses to concede, Mr. Trump has stoked fear and anxiety among many Americans, and he has plainly slowed critical transition processes, to the concern of the Biden team. Yet publicly, Mr. Biden and his aides are seeking to project steadiness. They have ignored Mr. Trump’s tweets, they are building out a White House staff and they are working to model how a shift away from four years of presidential tumult can be done — and how Mr. Biden is likely to behave once he is in the White House.

“He is not going to get his knickers in a twist around Donald Trump’s bad manners,” said former Senator Carol Moseley Braun, Democrat of Illinois, who served in the Senate with Mr. Biden. “He knows that he’s going to be president on the 20th of January.”

Still, she acknowledged: “I know he wants to get started on the transition. He would like some support from the administration to do that. But he’s going forward based on his own resources.”

Mr. Biden, who spent much of the week working from the Wilmington, Del., area, held calls with Pope Francis and the leaders of many of the nation’s closest allies, taking initial steps toward his goal of repairing the country’s standing on the world stage following a campaign in which he emphasized his relationships with world leaders.

After spending months stressing the need to follow science, he named a group of experts to advise him on the coronavirus pandemic, and on Friday he issued a statement calling for “urgent action” as virus cases continue to surge.

And he named Ron Klain, a veteran Washington figure who served as the Ebola czar in the Obama White House, as his chief of staff, a pick that was well received across the ideological spectrum within the Democratic Party.

Those steps, to prepare to govern and to combat the pandemic that has upended American society, followed convention and unfolded without drama. Mr. Biden has decades of experience in Washington to draw on, and his initial moves after winning the presidency demonstrated a familiarity with how one administration typically passes the torch to the next.

“It’s a reflection of the president-elect’s desire to project stability at a time of great instability,” said former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa, who served as agriculture secretary for President Barack Obama and was an early Biden supporter.

What was not typical — far from it — was the reaction of Mr. Trump, who continued to refuse to concede, and to make false claims about election fraud. But Mr. Biden pressed on and passed up the chance for aggressive confrontation, treating the president of the United States as if he were a heckler shouting from the bleachers who would eventually tire and go home.

This week, Bob Bauer, a Biden campaign adviser and former White House counsel, described Mr. Trump’s election-related legal challenges as “noise,” while Mr. Biden’s sister and close political adviser, Valerie Biden Owens, downplayed the significance of any postelection commentary offered by the president.

“It doesn’t matter what Donald Trump says,” she said on “Axios on HBO.” “It doesn’t matter. Joe is president-elect. He will be sworn in on Jan. 20.”

Mr. Biden himself suggested Mr. Trump’s refusal to concede was more of a stain on the president’s name for the history books than an imminent obstacle for the Biden transition, telling reporters on Tuesday: “How can I say this tactfully? I think it will not help the president’s legacy.”

Asked how he expected to work with Republicans if they would not even acknowledge him as president-elect, Mr. Biden responded with a smile: “They will. They will.”

Not everyone is so confident that Republicans will engage — or that Mr. Biden should even prioritize trying to work with them.

“Biden’s path to victory in his administration is going to be by putting forward bold plans to address Covid, the economy, climate change and racial injustice,” said Garrett Blad, a spokesman for the Sunrise Movement, a youth-driven progressive organization that is focused on climate and has sought to shape Mr. Biden’s appointments. “Working with the G.O.P. elite who right now are trying to undermine our democracy we do not believe is a strong way forward.”

Mr. Biden’s advisers and allies have acknowledged that they are in fact troubled by the possible ramifications from the Trump administration’s refusal to give Mr. Biden and his transition team access to federal agencies as well as intelligence briefings.

The head of the General Services Administration has not formally recognized Mr. Biden as the winner of the election, a step that allows the transfer of power between administrations to proceed.

As more time passes, that refusal becomes more problematic, Biden aides say. But even so, they are showing little eagerness to raise the temperature or to wage a legal battle.

“We’re not interested in having a food fight with the G.S.A. administrator or anyone, really,” Jen Psaki, a Biden transition adviser, said on Friday. “We just want to get access to intelligence information, to threat assessments, to the ongoing work on Covid, so that we can prepare to govern.”

In the meantime, Mr. Biden was taking a break — or something resembling a break. He traveled on Thursday to his vacation house in Rehoboth Beach, Del. “He’s earned, certainly, a couple days off,” Ms. Psaki said.

A Surging Virus and a Muddled Transition,"The 2024 G.O.P. contenders still won’t say anything critical about Trump. But how will that play out if he runs again in four years? It’s Friday, and this is your politics tip sheet. Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.

Joe Biden is ready to settle into the driver’s seat and get rolling — but he needs to get his hands on the keys first. And so far, President Trump has refused to give them to him. Biden still hasn’t received access to government offices, secure communications or classified briefings on national security, leaving lawmakers in both parties worried.

But especially vexing to his team is the fact that Trump’s denial of the election results has left him in the dark about crucial elements of the federal coronavirus response — at a time when the virus is exploding across the country. Unable to work with the White House on a transition, Biden’s advisers have been left to glean what they can from former Trump administration officials.

And Biden’s team is focusing on planning elements of its coronavirus strategy that don’t depend on information from the Trump administration. That includes a nationwide testing plan, which Trump never put in place and Biden is designing from scratch with help from experts at the Rockefeller Foundation.

Despite the White House’s refusal to cooperate, Biden has been talking to world leaders — though he had to make his first contacts without the secured phone lines that he could have used if he were officially recognized as president-elect. He has received congratulatory calls from national leaders in Asia, Europe and Australia.

Yesterday he also talked to Pope Francis, whom Biden thanked for “promoting peace, reconciliation and the common bonds of humanity around the world,” his transition office said.

Biden, who is only the second Catholic to be elected president, pledged to work with the pope to fight global warming and to care “for the marginalized and the poor.”

This week, James Lankford, a Republican senator from Oklahoma, told a radio interviewer that he would step in to make sure Biden had access to daily briefings if the president still wasn’t making them available by the end of the week.

And yesterday, Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican and member of the Senate leadership, said he agreed that Biden should have access to those files. “I don’t think they need to know everything,” Blunt said of Biden’s advisers. “I think they do need to know some things, and national security would be one of them.”

Like most of their G.O.P. colleagues, Lankford and Blunt have not yet acknowledged outright that Biden won the race, even if their comments make it fairly clear how they see things. Lankford, for his part, appeared to back off his earlier comments slightly, saying yesterday that while he supported briefings for Biden, “we still don’t know who the president’s going to be.”

But other Republicans have simply stopped playing along with Trump’s claim that the election’s results are in doubt. Mike DeWine, the Republican governor of Ohio, who just days earlier had said that he wanted to wait until legal disputes played out before accepting the winner of the election, changed his tune yesterday.

“We need to consider the former vice president as the president-elect,” DeWine said on CNN. “Joe Biden is the president-elect.”

Karl Rove, an influential top adviser to President George W. Bush, published an op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday titled, “This Election Result Won’t Be Overturned.”

When asked for a date by which Trump should accept the reality of his loss, Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, set a firm deadline: Dec. 13, one day before the Electoral College delegations will cast their votes for president.

This all produces a complex calculus for Republicans looking to run for president in 2024. None of those widely seen as contenders have spoken out to say that Trump should accept the results and move on.

Trump himself is talking seriously about running for president again in 2024, according to his advisers, who say that he now privately acknowledges what he publicly disputes: that he has lost.

And no matter what path he chooses, it’s increasingly clear that removing the 45th president from the Oval Office will not mean keeping him out of the news cycle.

“When you look at the number of votes that he got, you look at the kind of enthusiasm that he engenders, I mean — he’s going to be a very, very significant figure whether he’s in the White House or not,” said Josh Hawley, a Republican senator from Missouri seen as a potential presidential candidate. “I don’t know who else would be considered the leader, if not for him.”

The sunset behind the White House colored the sky pink yesterday.

The two-and-a-half-month period from Election Day to Inauguration Day usually goes by the book. Milestones must be met, and protocols guide things along.

But this year, Trump’s refusal to accept the results — and his party’s enabling of him — has blown up the usual timeline, complicating the process and making these matters of federal minutiae an issue of public concern, as Maggie Astor writes in a detailed explainer.

At every step of the way, from election to inauguration, where once there was a presumption that things would simply follow tradition, there is now an opportunity for Trump’s team to grind up the gears.

First, after completing a final vote count, the governor of each state must issue a “certificate of ascertainment,” announcing the winner of his or her state’s presidential election. The Trump campaign has sought to slow down or delay the ascertainment process, hoping that in states where Republicans control the legislature, if the governor missed the deadline to announce results, the legislature could then step in and name pro-Trump electors.

In Pennsylvania and Michigan, for instance, Republicans have filed lawsuits to block certification based on baseless allegations of voting or counting irregularities, but judges have so far rejected their arguments.

Each state’s electors will then cast their votes on Dec. 14, and most states have laws that force their electors to vote for the candidate who is certified as that state’s winner. On Jan. 6, Congress will count and certify the electoral votes, and the winner will be sworn in two weeks later.

Trump Pentagon Purge Could Accelerate His Goal to Pull Troops From Afghanistan,"WASHINGTON — Consistent is not the adjective many would use to describe President Trump’s national security policy. But there is one goal he has nurtured since the 2016 campaign: withdrawing all American troops from Afghanistan.

Now, in the waning days of his presidency, Mr. Trump is scrambling to make it so, aided by conservative antiwar forces who see it not only as good policy but also as a linchpin to any future he may seek in politics.

This week, Mr. Trump dismissed his defense secretary, Mark T. Esper, who had repeatedly expressed reluctance for a fast pullout from Afghanistan, replacing him with Christopher C. Miller, the former director of the National Counterterrorism Center, who may lack the stature and experience to push back effectively on Mr. Trump’s 11th-hour foreign policy actions.

Notably, Douglas Macgregor, a retired Army colonel and fierce proponent of ending American involvement in Afghanistan, was named this week as a senior adviser to Mr. Miller.

Mr. Trump recently nominated a new ambassador to Afghanistan, William Ruger, the vice president for research and policy at the Charles Koch Institute — a vocal and well-financed opponent of current conflicts abroad. Even before any Senate confirmation, which seems unlikely before Inauguration Day, Mr. Ruger maintains a large chair at Mr. Trump’s foreign policy table.

“The president has had difficulty finding personnel who would faithfully execute on his preferences,” Mr. Ruger said in an interview on Friday. With the new Pentagon leadership, “the president could really cement a legacy here,” he said, adding that Mr. Trump “could be the leader who ends America’s longest war.”

This week, the American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Austin S. Miller, traveled to Washington on a previously scheduled trip as officials in both countries braced for a possible announcement as early as next week to quickly reduce the 4,500 United States troops still left in Afghanistan. Mr. Trump has said previously that he wants to pull all troops from Afghanistan by Christmas.

With his recent flurry of firings and appointments, Mr. Trump has effectively pulled down a majority of the personnel guardrails against a fast withdrawal.

Mr. Trump’s views on reducing the United States’ footprint overseas are long standing and a central component of his “America First” foreign policy agenda. After originally supporting the war in Iraq, he spent years criticizing President George W. Bush for America’s wars in the region. During his 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump astonished fellow Republicans by directly attacking Mr. Bush about the war in Iraq and suggesting he failed to prevent the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

But what many Republicans failed to grasp is that Mr. Trump’s positions on the so-called endless wars were good politics. Rancor toward those conflicts has grown among many conservatives, including those in the Koch circle, as well as libertarians among congressional Republicans and even those on the left, including Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, among others.

Last year, VoteVets, the liberal political action committee, and the conservative Concerned Veterans for America teamed up to persuade Congress to revoke authorizations of military force passed after Sept. 11. Mr. Trump also replaced the hawkish John R. Bolton with Robert C. O’Brien as his national security adviser. Mr. O’Brien has said the United States needs to redirect its resources from Afghanistan and toward the competition and possible conflicts with China and Russia.

Polls have shown that a majority of veterans have grown disenchanted with the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, which helped Mr. Trump earn strong support among veterans who voted in 2016. Many have been disappointed that troops remain deployed in Afghanistan and that other promises to reduce the military presence in other regions have not been fulfilled.

Exit polls this month suggest that Mr. Trump won veterans 54 percent to 44 percent; in 2016, the poll found he won veterans 60 percent to 34 percent, a major shift that could stem from a variety of factors including his mixed record on these issues.

President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. will find himself having to address these political dynamics at home and the realities on the ground as progress toward peace between the Taliban and the Afghan government stalls.

Critics of a fast withdrawal before the Taliban meet the conditions of a recent peace agreement fear that any attempt to pull all American troops by year’s end would potentially result in deaths on the ground. Citing recent escalating violence across the country, they worry that the Taliban could succeed at seizing more territory, especially in the south, the group’s historic center of power.

“It’s irresponsible to make troop reduction your entire political objective,” said Evelyn N. Farkas, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense. “If you withdraw irresponsibly, you put strategic objectives and military lives at risk.”

Critics of an accelerated withdrawal point to logistical challenges of the strategy. Several current and former Pentagon officials have noted that a withdrawal within two months — which seems to be Mr. Trump’s goal — would be challenging, given the amount of military equipment that would have to be shipped out to avoid becoming spoils for the Taliban.

“Those in the Pentagon will use the logistics argument to slow this down,” said Dan Caldwell, a senior adviser to Concerned Veterans for America, a group that has strongly influenced veterans’ policies under Mr. Trump. “People there have slow-walked this and tried to box the president in and that likely upset the president and did not endear Secretary Esper to him.”

Over the last year, the organization has spent over $3 million on advertisements in support of an Afghanistan withdrawal. Conservative news media personalities, including Tucker Carlson, have also advocated the drawdown. If Mr. Trump actually announces an expedited plan, “we are going to go big,” Mr. Caldwell said.

Of course with Mr. Trump, strongly expressed intentions concerning troops often do not come to fruition.

After announcing a full troop withdrawal from Syria in late 2018 — and abandoning Kurdish allies, for which he was widely criticized — he opted to leave several hundred troops in Syria.

He has also told aides he wanted to greatly reduce the 700 American troops in Somalia — most of them Special Operations forces — and so far that has gone nowhere.

Mr. Ruger said the pressure would remain when Mr. Biden takes office.

“Regardless of who the president is, we will support good policies,” he said. “Getting out of Afghanistan is good policy.”

Biden Implores Trump to Confront a Surging Pandemic,"WASHINGTON — President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. demanded on Friday that President Trump do more to confront the coronavirus infections exploding across the country, calling the federal response “woefully lacking” even as Mr. Trump broke a 10-day silence on the pandemic to threaten to withhold a vaccine from New York.

In a blistering statement, Mr. Biden said that the recent surge, which is killing more than 1,000 Americans every day and has hospitalized about 70,000 in total, required a “robust and immediate federal response.”

“I will not be president until next year,” Mr. Biden said. “The crisis does not respect dates on the calendar, it is accelerating right now. Urgent action is needed today, now, by the current administration — starting with an acknowledgment of how serious the current situation is.”

Mr. Biden released his statement less than an hour before the president appeared in the Rose Garden at the White House, where he announced no new measures to slow the virus’s long-anticipated autumn surge, which he hardly acknowledged.

Mr. Trump hailed the news from Monday that a vaccine under development by Pfizer appeared to be 90 percent effective. But he vowed not to order widespread lockdowns as long as he remained in office and threatened to withhold distribution of the vaccine to New York because Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the state intended to conduct its own review of the vaccine’s approval by the federal government.

“He doesn’t trust the fact that it’s this White House, this administration, so we won’t be delivering it to New York until we have authorization to do so,” Mr. Trump told reporters in only his second public remarks since Election Day. “So the governor will let us know when he’s ready. He’s had some very bad editorials recently about this.”

It is not clear whether Mr. Trump would be able to follow through on that threat before he leaves office. Health care workers, older adults and other vulnerable populations could get access to a vaccine by mid-December, well before Mr. Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration.

Standing next to Mr. Trump Friday afternoon, Moncef Slaoui, a pharmaceutical executive who was appointed by the president to oversee the vaccine development and distribution effort known as Operation Warp Speed, said that approximately 20 million people could be vaccinated in the United States in December.

But by the time broader distribution of a vaccine is underway next spring, Mr. Trump’s presidency will have long ended.

A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, Rich Azzopardi, responded on Twitter, saying that Mr. Trump “has failed with his pandemic response, lied to Americans about how bad it was when he knew otherwise & was fired by voters for his incompetence. @NYGovCuomo is fighting to ensure the communities hit hardest by Covid get the vaccine. Feds providing 0 resources.”

Federal resources were very much on the minds of state officials as they grappled with infection numbers shooting skyward and hospitals on the verge of being overrun.

Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin, where the number of new cases reached a daily record 8,256 on Thursday, said whatever Mr. Trump said now could not make up for his refusals to wear a mask and his embrace of large public gatherings, at campaign rallies and at the White House.

While the outgoing administration could still help, Gov. Evers said, “they also report to a president who, frankly, isn’t the most consistent one as it relates to the things that count: masks, and making sure you’re not in public gatherings with a whole bunch of people to spread the disease.”

“They’re not going to play a huge political role here,” he added.

Jennifer Miller, a spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, said much of the department’s response had been paid for by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, known as the CARES Act, which is set to expire Dec. 31, thanks in part to Mr. Trump’s failure to negotiate new relief despite months of wrangling with Congress.

Kim Deti, a spokeswoman for the Wyoming Department of Health, said health officials there were also concerned about having enough money to continue contact tracing and other operations that they believed had kept the state’s virus cases low for much of the year.

“Will funding run out by the end of the year? Will it be continued?” Ms. Deti wrote in an email. “It’s clear our Covid-19 response will need to continue into 2021.”

On Friday, Dr. Slaoui told The Financial Times that Mr. Trump’s administration should share information about the program with Mr. Biden’s transition team, something that has not yet happened because Mr. Trump has refused to concede defeat.

“It is a matter of life and death for thousands of people,” he told the newspaper. “The operation has always been about making vaccines and therapeutics available faster for the country and for the world.”

Mr. Biden’s statement on Friday underscored his pledge to make the pandemic his top priority when he takes office. Since claiming victory last Saturday, the president-elect has named a 13-member Covid advisory board, delivered several speeches about the topic, and repeatedly urged the public to wear masks and practice social distancing.

By contrast, since Election Day, Mr. Trump has tweeted more than 264 times, much of it falsely claiming that the election was stolen from him and only twice about the virus.

There have been no public briefings by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and little public guidance on the pandemic’s latest deadly surge.

“I believe in one government at a time, but at the moment we have no government with respect to coronavirus,” said Richard J. Danzig, a former Navy secretary to President Bill Clinton and a senior adviser with the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.

The White House’s coronavirus task force still meets once a week, but with little resemblance to its functions in the spring, when it gathered to update reporters each day and published federal guidelines. Vice President Mike Pence, who leads the task force, said on Friday that members of the group would discuss the increase in cases during their weekly call with governors on Monday.

Some federal officials — notably Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, and Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator — have continued to speak out.

“I’m not silent, that’s for sure,” Dr. Fauci said in an interview this week.

Dr. Fauci, who has not spoken to Mr. Trump since weeks before Election Day, added that he was convinced the United States could turn the current trends around if everyone wore a mask, practiced social distancing and avoided crowded settings, particularly indoors.

“Those are tools that have been shown to be effective in blunting surges,” he said.

Mr. Trump claimed at Friday’s event that the effectiveness of Pfizer’s vaccine was the result of the company’s participation in Operation Warp Speed. Pfizer took no money from the program for research and development, but it did sign a $1.95 billion contract to guarantee the government would purchase its vaccine. Mr. Trump chided the company for initially saying that its vaccine had not been helped by Warp Speed.

More than 161 former public officials, many with deep national security and military experience, said in a statement Friday that the administration’s refusal to give Mr. Biden immediate access to intelligence briefings and other transition services posed “a serious risk to our national security.”

They noted that delays in the transition after the contested election of 2000 left the country vulnerable to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and that the 9/11 Commission had recommended minimizing disruption during presidential transitions.

“That recommendation carries all the more force amidst a once-in-a-century pandemic,” they wrote.

"Trump Loses String of Election Lawsuits, Leaving Few Vehicles to Fight His Defeat","President Trump suffered multiple legal setbacks in three key swing states on Friday, choking off many of his last-ditch efforts to use the courts to delay or block President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory.

In quick succession, Mr. Trump was handed defeats in Pennsylvania, Arizona and Michigan, where a state judge in Detroit rejected an unusual Republican attempt to halt the certification of the vote in Wayne County pending an audit of the count.

The legal losses came as Mr. Biden was declared the victor in Georgia and a day after an agency in the president’s own Department of Homeland Security flatly contradicted him by declaring that the election “was the most secure in American history” and that “there is no evidence” any voting systems malfunctioned.

On Friday, 16 federal prosecutors who had been assigned to monitor the election also directly debunked claims of widespread fraud, saying in a letter to Attorney General William P. Barr that there was no evidence of substantial irregularities.

In his first public remarks of the week, Mr. Trump ignored the developments during an appearance in the Rose Garden. But he showed a momentary crack in his previously relentless insistence that he would eventually be proclaimed the winner of the campaign, saying at one point, “Whatever happens in the future, who knows, which administration, I guess time will tell.”

Mr. Trump’s bad day at the bar began at dawn when news emerged that lawyers from the Ohio-based law firm Porter Wright Morris & Arthur had abruptly withdrawn from a federal lawsuit they had filed only days earlier on his behalf in Pennsylvania. The firm’s withdrawal followed internal tensions at the firm about its work for Mr. Trump and concerns by some lawyers that Porter Wright was being used to undercut the integrity of the electoral process.

Then, shortly after noon, a lawyer for the Trump campaign effectively dropped its so-called Sharpiegate lawsuit in Arizona. That lawsuit had claimed that some ballots cast for Mr. Trump were invalidated after voters in Maricopa County had used Sharpie pens, causing “ink bleeds.” The lawyer, Kory Langhofer, acknowledged that not enough presidential votes were at stake in the case to affect the outcome of the race.

The lawsuit, which stemmed from a viral rumor that falsely claimed Arizona’s voting machines were incapable of tabulating ballots filled out with Sharpies, was already on the rocks. At a hearing on Thursday, Mr. Langhofer told the court that the county’s vote count had been affected merely by “good-faith errors,” not by fraud, as Mr. Trump has been claiming for days.

“We are not saying anyone is trying to steal the election,” Mr. Langhofer said.

With victories in Arizona and Georgia, Mr. Biden has matched the 306 electoral votes that Mr. Trump racked up four years ago. Mr. Biden was declared the winner of Arizona’s 11 electoral votes on Thursday night after he finished more than 11,000 votes ahead of Mr. Trump. At the court hearing earlier that day, a Maricopa County elections official testified that only 191 presidential votes in the county might have been affected by Mr. Langhofer’s suit.

Around 2 p.m. Friday, the state court judge in Michigan, Timothy M. Kenny, dealt Mr. Trump another blow by denying an emergency motion filed by two Republican poll workers who had asked him to halt the certification of the vote in Wayne County — home to Detroit — pending an audit of the count. States have to certify the results of the election — confirming that the vote tabulation was accurate — in order to apportion their Electoral College votes.

The ruling by Judge Kenny meant that the formal completion of the vote in Wayne County — and the broader vote in Michigan — could continue on pace. Some legal scholars have suggested that delaying certification of the vote in key states is part of a last-ditch strategy by the Trump campaign to throw the election to Republican-led state legislatures.

At a hearing this week in Detroit, lawyers for the city had asked Judge Kenny not to delay certification out of concern about this gambit. In his ruling, the judge noted that the audit requested by the two Republican plaintiffs, Cheryl Costantino and Edward McCall, would have been “unwieldy” and forced the rest of Michigan to wait.

“It would be an unprecedented exercise of judicial activism for this court to stop the certification process,” Judge Kenny added.

In a lawsuit filed last week, Ms. Costantino and Mr. McCall had made wide-ranging claims of irregularities during the vote count at Detroit’s TCF Convention Center.

They charged that some poll workers in the heavily Democratic city were coaching voters to cast their ballots for Mr. Biden, that some Republican poll challengers were not given adequate access to monitor the vote count, and that loads of ballots were improperly brought into the convention center in the middle of the night.

Lawyers for Detroit and for the Michigan Democratic Party had argued in court papers that about 100 Republican poll challengers had in fact been let into the convention center, but that some were not allowed to return after leaving once the room filled up.

Judge Kenny wrote that while he took some of these accusations seriously, some were too general to be proved and others were “rife with speculation and guesswork.”

He dismissed an affidavit by one Republican poll observer charging that computers at the convention center had been improperly connected to the internet, noting that the observer’s credibility was suspect: Before the election, the observer had posted on Facebook that the Democrats were using the coronavirus crisis as “a cover for Election Day fraud.”

In between the events in Arizona and Michigan, another court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, handed the president another defeat.

The court upheld Pennsylvania’s three-day extension for the deadline to accept mail-in ballots, against which the Trump campaign has vociferously fought. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court had already issued a similar decision, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to accept Mr. Trump’s attempt to challenge it.

As the president was speaking in the Rose Garden, Marc E. Elias, a lawyer who has handled several election cases on behalf of the Democrats, wrote on Twitter: “Another Friday afternoon with more good news coming from the courts.”

That turned out to be two more victories in Pennsylvania.

In one, a Montgomery County Common Pleas Court denied the Trump campaign’s request to invalidate a batch of mail-in ballots. In the other, a Philadelphia County Common Pleas Court rejected the campaign’s appeal seeking to invalidate five more batches of mail-in ballots.

The total number of ballots at stake in the two decisions: 8,927.

Mr. Trump was not ready to give up. He posted on Twitter on Friday evening that he would win in Pennsylvania, making a baseless assertion about vote counting in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.

With the legal fight not going well, the president put his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, in charge of his campaign lawsuits related to the outcome of the election, as well as all public communications related to them, four people familiar with the move said.

Mr. Trump has been trying every possible option to change the outcome and has been trying to get what he sees as “fighters” making his case, often conflating a media strategy with a legal one.

But the involvement of Mr. Giuliani, who held a widely mocked news conference last weekend in front of a landscaping company in Philadelphia in which he claimed widespread fraud, has vexed people on the campaign and in the White House.

The Trump campaign and its proxies still have some cases working their ways through the courts, including one in Federal District Court in Grand Rapids, Mich., that closely mirrors the Michigan state case that Judge Kenny ended on Friday.

A lawsuit seeking to delay certification of the vote in several counties in Wisconsin was filed on Thursday in Federal District Court in Green Bay. On Tuesday, a federal judge in Williamsport, Pa., will hear arguments in a lawsuit that seeks to halt the certification of the vote in several counties in that state.

Election Officials Directly Contradict Trump on Voting System Fraud,"WASHINGTON — Hours after President Trump repeated a baseless report that a voting machine system “deleted 2.7 million Trump votes nationwide,” he was directly contradicted by a group of federal, state and local election officials, who issued a statement on Thursday declaring flatly that the election “was the most secure in American history” and that “there is no evidence” any voting systems were compromised.

The rebuke, in a statement by a coordinating council overseeing the voting systems used around the country, never mentioned Mr. Trump by name. But it amounted to a remarkable corrective to a wave of disinformation that Mr. Trump has been pushing across his Twitter feed.

The statement was distributed by the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which is responsible for helping states secure the voting process. Coming directly from one of Mr. Trump’s own cabinet agencies, it further isolated the president in his false claims that widespread fraud cost him the election.

The statement also came as a previously unified Republican Party showed signs of cracking on the question of whether to keep backing the president.

Across the country, election officials have said the vote came off smoothly, with no reports of systemic fraud in any state, no sign of foreign interference in the voting infrastructure and no hardware or software failures beyond the episodic glitches that happen in any election. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s lead in the popular vote has expanded to more than five million, and he remains on track to win a solid victory in the Electoral College.

The group that issued the statement was the Elections Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council, which includes top officials from the cybersecurity agency, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission and secretaries of state and state election directors from around the country. The group also includes representatives from the voting machine industry, which has often been accused of being slow to admit to technological shortcomings and resistant to creating paper backups.

“While we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should, too,” the officials added in their statement. “When you have questions, turn to elections officials as trusted voices as they administer elections.”

In 2020, in part because of the vastly increased use of mail-in ballots, more than 92 percent of votes had some form of paper backup that can be used in audits or recounts.

Voting machines. Our democracy depends on them to accurately record each and every ballot. You go to the polls, you cast your vote, your voice is heard. Right? Not so fast. “Russian attacks.” “Russian hackers.” “Russian hackers tried to break into U.S. election systems.” Because in 2016 — “The Russians managed to get us paranoid about the security of our own election systems.” But this year, experts are more confident that — “I think it is safe to say this is the most secure election we’ve ever held in the United States.” In 2016, Russia targeted vulnerabilites in election systems in every single state. “This was one of the most successful intelligence operations in modern history.” Now, there’s no evidence Russians altered votes, but — “It’s as if a cat burglar got into your house, cased the joint, but didn’t take anything.” And it raised the question — “Could the Russians actually affect the vote?” But because of some of the machines we were using, we didn’t know for sure. So in 2020, if there’s another cyberattack, Americans want to know that their vote was counted as they cast it. Like, say, with a — “Voter-verified paper trail.” Yes, like that. A paper trail. Turns out a few people tried to make this happen years ago, but — “It’s a rough world out there in the elections voting system business.” To see why it took Russia’s hacking to improve our voting technology, we go to Texas. The Constitution gives states power to run their own elections, and most states give counties the power to choose their own voting machines. And nowhere is this more apparent than in — “Texas.” “Texas.” “Texas —” [mooing] “— is a microcosm of all the different voting technologies used everywhere in the U.S. Every different Texas county, different voting system, different procedures.” Dan Wallach is a computer scientist at Rice University in Houston, and he had actually been warning about the vulnerabilities of our voting system long before 2016. “I’m worried about evil software in the machines flipping your vote in a way that you, the voter, can’t tell that the machine was evil.” He was most concerned about direct recording electronic voting machines, or DREs. “The only record of your vote is inside the memory of that machine. And that means that if something tampers with that electronic memory, you have no way to go back.” And yet in the last presidential election, 28 percent of registered voters used these machines. So how did some Americans get stuck with these vulnerable voting machines? Well, to find out, we need to go all the way back to 2000. The aught. Florida. It was Al Gore versus George Bush for president. “Oh my goodness. 2000. That was the election that we all thought would never end. “The presidential race is crackling like a hickory fire here. Couldn’t be much closer.” A contested vote, a recount and all of it came down to the chads. Those pesky fragments of paper leftover when a hole is punched in a card. Not all those chads were entirely punched through, though. “There was a hanging chad.” “It’s slightly detached.” “Pregnant chad.” “Dimpled chad.” “Opening and closing chad.” During the recount, poll workers were left to determine voter intent, and all eyes were on the chads. “By that time, we all knew what a bad system punch-card voting was.” “In the wake of the hanging chad issues, Congress passed the Help America Vote Act in 2002. The Help America Vote Act allocated billions of dollars to help states replace antiquated voting machines.” And the states went shopping. Some bought hand-marked paper ballots and optical scanners. And others bought the machines that had worried Dan the most. The very modern, paperless DREs. “If it were up to me today, and if I were selling voting technology, I would not sell a paperless DRE system in good conscience. I don’t think that it’s a responsible thing to do.” This is Eddie Perez. He used to sell these machines, but left the industry to advocate for more secure voting systems with a paper trail. “I would characterize the level of federal regulation for voting technology as relatively thin. There are a lot of products that are actually more highly regulated than voting technology. Even things as mundane as ballpoint pens. Parts fail, systems get old, screens stop performing the way they are supposed to. So a voter might touch one portion of the screen to mark one candidate and the system interprets it as a choice for someone else.” “It is not letting me vote for who I want to vote for.” “There is plenty of voting equipment that is still out there whose design dates, probably, all the way back to 20 years ago.” But with most of their federal money spent, many Texas counties were stuck. “We kept our electronic voting system for 18 years.” As Travis County Clerk, Dana DeBeauvoir picks the machines for voters in Austin. And back in 2001, “The thing that was most important to our voters was to have a paper trail. But none of the voting system manufacturers would build a system with a paper trail. And it was frustrating.” And so she decided to build one herself. “I was watching a video of a professor out of Rice University rake me over the coals.” “Such blatant security flaws. I mean, just really bad engineering.” “Instead of just getting mad, I went to that person.” “My phone rings and it’s Dana, and she says, ‘I want your help.’” “And I said to him, ‘Let’s you and I design a voting system together.’” “I’m like, seriously? All right. Can I invite my friends? We hacked up an inkjet printer and a bunch of other cheap hardware mashed into a custom steel box that we built, and we came up with a really great design.” They called it S.T.A.R. Vote. “Computer scientists love to make acronyms out of words. First we come up with the acronym, then we try to find the words that fit.” “Secure.” “Transparent.” “Auditable.” “Reliable.” “A combination of both electronic and paper voting paper voting methods.” “S.T.A.R. Vote.” A new electronic voting machine with paper backup ballots that help with verification and audit. An open-source system which makes it more secure and cheaper for taxpayers. The end product, a newer, safer voting machine. “What we were actually doing was a start-up business. And I don’t think we really realized that at the outset.” Designing a machine is one thing. Finding someone to manufacture it is another. “The voting system industry is a couple hundred million dollars a year. That’s a teeny tiny market.” “It’s difficult to get in the marketplace, and they don’t welcome anybody else coming in.” In a small market, there’s not much room for competition. Just three companies dominate the voting machine industry. “Those three major vendors are the ones that have carved out their space and made their commitment to it. And so they actually wield a lot of power in that industry.” “That market doesn’t leave a whole lot of room for companies to do innovative design and development.” “Voting technology is simply very, very slow to change.” “Current electronic voting machines have little or no security built in. Please help me and other elections administrators who want to do a better job. What we are designing is an electronic voting system. We’re ready to start building S.T.A.R. Vote.” In 2016, Dana DeBeauvoir had reached the final stages of the S.T.A.R. Vote design when reports that … “The intelligence services of a foreign power intervened on a scale never seen before.” … shook America’s confidence in its voting system. It seemed like the perfect moment for new players like S.T.A.R. Vote, who’d spent years thinking about how to get voters to trust their election results. “Since we had done all the design work for them, we thought one of the regular manufacturers would pick this up. Travis County put it out to bid. Most of the big manufacturers submitted bids. However, they submitted bids that were more along the lines of, buy what we already have.” She says the vendors rejected a key security component of S.T.A.R. Vote. “Open-source software.” Good for transparency, but having free source code means companies can’t charge as much. “Open-source systems — at least the way this one was designed, and in most cases — are low-revenue software projects.” They all passed. With the 2020 election around the corner, Dana still had all those aging DREs, so she was — “Running out of time. At that point, we realized that we had reached the end of our possibilities with S.T.A.R. Vote. It was probably the lowest time in my entire career. We had the secret recipe for pulling everybody together, and we still hadn’t made it happen.” But bigger changes were happening nationally. After 2016, voting systems were declared part of the country’s critical infrastructure — like dams and power plants. This meant new federal scrutiny of how Americans cast their vote for the first time since 2000. “And the voting machine manufacturers began to get the message.” “Yes.” “They began to move towards systems that had paper backup because they recognized that the political pressure was tremendous.” In 2018, Congress gave the states more money to fortify their systems, with one intention that they buy new machines with a voter verified paper trail. “Six months after we got the bad news that no one was going to build S.T.A.R. Vote for us, we got a dramatic turnaround in the industry for voting systems. They had in fact built a new voting system with electronic support and a paper trail. My thrill was a little bit tempered by the frustration of knowing that they could have done it years before.” And so Travis County joins battleground states like Pennsylvania and Georgia, and went shopping. Again. “A lot of money.” And paper is the reason experts are saying 2020 may be the most secure election we’ve ever held. It’s not just about the voting machines. A greater number of e-poll books — which are used to check-in voters on Election Day — will also have a paper backup system. “And that’s why the Department of Homeland Security has spent a year trying to get cities and towns across America to print out those e-poll books to make sure that they had multiple backups of their registration systems.” A process moved further along by the pandemic. “You know in an odd way, the coronavirus crisis has helped us some in our election crises.” It’s pushed many states to shift to mail-in voting, which offers an automatic paper backup. In 2020, because of states buying new voting systems and the increase in vote-by-mail, an estimated 95 percent of voters will use auditable paper ballots. That’s not to say the shift to paper has been problem-free. Some states bought machines that produce a barcode for a paper ballot, which makes it harder for voters to verify. “The paper that comes out of the machine — machine-marked paper — has a barcode on it that is the official vote. No human can read a barcode.” And in various states, there have been printing errors on mail-in ballots. “There’s a different name on the ballot that you’re supposed to send in.” Still, when it comes to hacking and widespread fraud, experts agree that paper — through mail-in voting or with a voter verified paper trail — is as safe as it gets. “Having a paper ballot mailed to more and more Americans means there is a traceable way for people to vote. And a way for election monitors to audit later on that those votes were counted the way they were cast. And that they were cast by people eligible to vote.” The nation’s voting system is safer than it was four years ago, but some counties didn’t make the transition and could be more vulnerable. “The only states with significant amounts of non-paper digital ballots are states like, honestly, Texas.” Texas, a potential swing state for 2020, lags behind the rest of the country in election security. Harris County, the third largest county in the nation, wasn’t able to purchase new machines and still has their DREs from 2006. And with the Texas Supreme Court refusing to expand absentee voting and by allowing during the pandemic, it puts extra pressure on the machines to function smoothly on Election Day. “A perception hack is a hack that is just big enough to create the illusion of a broad cyberattack. Because if they can manipulate some votes, registration systems, e-poll books, in just a few places, people will assume that they did so everywhere. That’s the beauty of a perception hack. And four years later, The psychological import of what the Russians did may be greater than anything that they actually hacked into, because they have managed to shake the confidence of American voters that their votes will be counted as they cast them.” This is Alex. And I’m Kassie. We produced this episode of “Stressed Election.” There’s a lot going on this election, and we want to make sure we take a deep dive into the major issues. Stick around for the next episodes. We’re going to cover voting rights, voting technology, disinformation and vote-by-mail.

The council was responsible only for the security of the actual election infrastructure — the voting machines, the scanners and the counting systems for ballots. So its statement did not encompass the full range of Mr. Trump’s accusations — rebutted by elections officials across the country — of other types of voting fraud, most notably that mail-in ballots were manipulated to give an advantage to Mr. Biden.

But Mr. Trump’s tweet on Thursday morning, citing an unsubstantiated report from One America News Network, which has backed Mr. Trump’s claims without skepticism, suggested that machines made by Dominion Voting Systems systematically deleted 2.7 million votes. His post immediately generated a warning from Twitter.

The basis of Mr. Trump’s claim was an error made in a county in Michigan, which initially miscounted a vote total in Mr. Biden’s favor. It was a human error, and it was quickly caught and corrected.

The Dominion software was used in only two of the five counties that had experienced Election Day hiccups in Michigan and Georgia. In every instance, there was a detailed explanation for what happened, most of it human error. In none of the cases did software affect the vote counts.

The council’s statement on Thursday was prompted by repeated “baseless claims of voter fraud that none of us have seen any evidence of,” said one the federal officials who signed it, Benjamin Hovland, the chairman of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.

Mr. Hovland said that the group was aware of Mr. Trump’s tweet about the Dominion systems before it published its statement, but that it was only one of many statements that had disturbed the group for days.

“Because of this politically motivated rhetoric, these baseless accusations, you’re seeing harassment of election officials, you’re seeing threats toward elections officials — completely unacceptable,” he said. “We’ve seen these accusations time and time again. We’ve seen them by this president from the very start.”

“What you see happening right now,” Mr. Hovland added, “is playing right into the hands of our foreign adversaries who want to see us lose faith in our democracy.”

It was not the first time that government agencies have taken on Mr. Trump’s falsehoods. In July, the Food and Drug Administration warned against the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat the coronavirus after Mr. Trump had embraced its use. The president was angry, but the head of the agency has survived.

Many of the charges of fraud, illegal voting and software troubles have come from Mr. Trump and his sons.

Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, called for “total war” in Georgia over what he claims is election fraud. Eric Trump shared conspiracy theories that poll workers in Arizona gave Trump voters Sharpie pens that could not be read by ballot scanners, a claim that was quickly debunked by Arizona’s secretary of state. The president’s supporters have sent death threats to poll workers in Pennsylvania.

Yet both before and after Election Day, Mr. Trump has been repeatedly contradicted — though never named — by the Department of Homeland Security’s cyberagency, as it has sought to dispel disinformation. The agency’s director, Christopher Krebs, had led the charge to secure election machines, registration systems and tabulation systems across the 50 states, sending experts to help and testing systems for vulnerabilities.

Mr. Krebs also argued that his agency had to counter the “hacking of minds as well as infrastructure,” and he created a “rumor control” page on his agency’s federal government website. It has repeatedly contradicted Mr. Trump, explaining why mail-in ballots do not lend themselves to fraud, and how states assure that the dead do not cast ballots.

Mr. Krebs, a former Microsoft executive with a quick wit and a willingness to resist political pressure, did not back down when these efforts created a backlash in the White House. And he was praised in public recently by the acting secretary of homeland security, Chad F. Wolf, for the “rumor control” effort.

Mr. Krebs has widely been rumored to be on the hit list of officials who may be fired by the White House, along with the C.I.A. director, Gina Haspel, and the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray. But so far, the boom has not been lowered.

One of Mr. Krebs’s top deputies, Bryan Ware, the assistant director for cybersecurity, submitted his resignation on Thursday. Valerie Boyd, a senior official for international affairs at the Department of Homeland Security who also worked at the National Security Council in the Obama administration, was ousted after the White House asked for her resignation, according to a homeland security official.

In a statement, Lily Adams, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, said, “It has always been clear that this election was free, fair and secure, and now even Trump’s own Department of Homeland Security has fact checked his lies.”

Biden Asked Republicans to Give Him a Chance. They’re Not Interested.,"MASON, Texas — The change at the Sunday prayer service was so subtle it went unnoticed by several congregants. Tucked in between calls for divine health and wisdom, the Rev. Fred Krebs of St. Paul Lutheran Church, who rarely brings up politics, fleetingly mentioned this month’s presidential election.

“We pray for a peaceful transition,” he told his congregation of 50 people. The carefully chosen words underscored the political reality in Mason, a rural, conservative town of roughly 2,000 people, after Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory over President Trump. Not everyone thought the election was over, and not everyone said they would respect the results.

“My Democratic friends think Biden is going to heal everything and unify everyone,” said Jeanie Smith, who attends the more conservative Spring Street Gospel Church in Mason, which is about 100 miles west of Austin. “They are deceived.”

“Now you want healing,” she added. “Now you want to come together. You have not earned it.”

That is the hard reality Mr. Biden is facing, even after winning a race in which he secured a larger share of the popular vote than any challenger since 1932. Towering before him is a wall of Republican resistance, starting with Mr. Trump’s refusal to concede, extending to G.O.P. lawmakers’ reluctance to acknowledge his victory and stretching, perhaps most significantly for American politics in the long term, to ordinary voters who steadfastly deny the election’s outcome.

It is all a far cry from how Mr. Biden framed this election, from the Democratic primary race through his victory speech last weekend. He cast the moment as a chance for the country to excise the political division Mr. Trump has stoked, promising to repair the ideological, racial and geographic fissures that have grown into chasms since 2016. Announcing his campaign, he called it an opportunity to restore “the soul of the nation.” Last weekend, he declared, “Let this grim era of demonization in America begin to end here and now.”

But on Election Day, Republican turnout surged across the country — particularly in rural areas like Mason, which along with its surrounding county had among the largest percentage increases in voter participation in Texas. Democratic dreams of a landslide were thwarted as Republicans notched surprise victories in the House and emerged as the favorite to retain control of the Senate. In the days since, thousands of Mr. Trump’s most fervent supporters have gathered across the country, including in Texas, to protest Mr. Biden’s triumph as illegitimate.

“We’re willing to accept the results, as long as it’s fair and done correctly and certified correctly,” said Sherrie Strong, another supporter of the president’s. She, like others, took Mr. Trump’s position that it was strange that he had been leading in numerous places because of in-person votes on Election Day, only to be overtaken once mail-in ballots were counted on election night and over the days that followed. (The delay in counting mail-in ballots in several states was because of restrictions imposed by Republican state legislatures.)

“It’s just a little upsetting when you go to bed at night, and all of a sudden, four days later, these votes are magically appearing,” Ms. Strong said.

Mr. Biden’s message did have political appeal, motivating a crucial slice of voters who helped him lead Democrats back into power.

Ann Mahnken, a 72-year-old lifelong conservative who attends the Lutheran church, said the prospect of his bringing the country together was why, after voting for Mr. Trump in 2016, she chose the Democratic candidate this time.

“I could not stand the way our country is,” she said. “I didn’t want to go through four more years of that, not in my senior citizen lifetime. I didn’t want to go through four more years of the chaos and the division.”

Mark Lehmberg, a fellow parishioner who voted for Mr. Trump this year after sitting out 2016, said he had given up on the concept of unity — and he advised Ms. Mahnken to do the same. He backed the president because he did not want the economy to shut down over the coronavirus.

“The relationships have already been jeopardized,” Mr. Lehmberg said. “It’s going be hard — impossible — to get people to come together.”

On Monday in Dallas, hundreds of Mr. Trump’s supporters gathered outside the city’s election office in a “Stop the Steal” protest promoted by the state Republican Party. The message from speakers and attendees went further than expressing fears of election fraud, amounting to a wholesale rejection of a Biden presidency and of the Republican elected officials who acknowledged it. One speaker said of the Republican lawmakers who had called Mr. Biden the president-elect, “Remember who they are when you go to the polls next.”

“This is contempt of half of the country by the other half of the country,” said Paul Feeser, 61, who attended the protest in Dallas. “So if the conclusion was for Biden, I would look at it as illegitimate, and I and many others expect to be part of the so-called resistance — as Trump resisted.”

Karen Bell, who was also at the rally, said her distrust centered on mail voting.

“In these swing states, he was ahead, and then all of a sudden in Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania, they stopped counting,” Ms. Bell said, echoing conspiracy theories about vote counting. “And then we wake up and suddenly Biden is ahead. These mystery votes all came in for Biden and zero for Trump. Something is definitely fishy there.”

Asked for any evidence of widespread election fraud, in light of the fact that election officials including Republicans have consistently dismissed such claims, Ms. Bell cited conspiratorial right-wing sites like Infowars. Election officials have made it clear: There is no evidence of widespread election fraud.

No matter what happens next, “I will not believe that the election was fair,” Ms. Bell said. “I will not believe that he is a legitimate winner.”

The feeling that Mr. Trump’s refusal to concede is justified, and that Mr. Biden’s rise to the presidency should not be recognized, is not universal for Republicans. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that nearly 80 percent of Americans believe Mr. Biden won, including about 60 percent of Republicans.

But other polling has provided mixed results, including a survey from Politico/Morning Consult showing that the number of Republicans who do not believe this year’s election was free and fair has doubled, from 35 percent before Election Day to 70 percent.

In Texas, conservatives have been crowing after Democratic hopes of flipping the state blue and winning control of the Legislature failed to materialize. Even so, state leaders have also fallen in line with the president’s baseless attempts to paint the election as unfair — and the state’s Republican lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, has offered $1 million for anyone who produces evidence of voter fraud.

But even in Mason, some who supported the president urged the party to move on. “This is over — it’s just what it is,” said Jay Curry, 44, who was arriving to eat at the Willow Creek Cafe and Club with his wife and two children.

The president’s refusal to concede “just means more turmoil and more division,” Mr. Curry said. “We’re divided. It’s red and blue. And they’re against each other more than they’re trying to help anybody.”

His wife, Andrea, was more optimistic.

“I think every president that we’ve had has never intentionally hurt our country,” she said. “They’re going to do their best and that’s all we can hope for.”

Mr. Biden, she added, “is not going to do some intentional crash of our country.”

Her hopefulness stood out in a landscape of dread. Pastor Krebs, the Lutheran minister, said the reason the election felt existential to some was that it represented a referendum on more than just politics.

As a community leader who arrived in Mason shortly before the 2016 election, he said, he has seen how the city’s views of the president are wrapped up in other issues, including the white majority’s relationship with Latino residents and a backlash to Black Lives Matter protesters striving for political power.

At the same time, Pastor Krebs said, sweeping generalities don’t do justice to the complexity of the community.

“Defining people strictly by their parties is not a good thing,” he said. “And I’ve learned that sometimes people think more deeply when they get into a conversation than when we just start labeling one another.”

Ms. Smith, 67, and her husband, Dennis, 69, tied their unequivocal support for the president — even in defeat — to larger cultural concerns.

Like Mr. Biden and his supporters, the Smiths saw this election as a battle for the country’s soul. To unify with Mr. Biden would be an admission that the battle is lost, and that the multicultural tide powering his victory will continue its ascension.

“Everything I worked for, Biden wants to give to the immigrants to help them live, when they don’t do nothing but sit on their butts,” Mr. Smith said.

“And if those protesters come here, if they go tearing up stuff, I guarantee you they won’t be in this town very long,” he added. “We’ll string them up and send them out of here — and it won’t be the same way they came in.”"
Here’s What Will Happen Between Election Day and Inauguration Day,"The people have spoken. Now what?

Normally, what happens between Election Day and Inauguration Day is a series of formalities to which few people need to pay attention. But President Trump’s refusal to acknowledge that he lost to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., and top Republicans’ acquiescence to his efforts to subvert the democratic process, have made the arcane procedures by which the will of the people is formalized a matter of public importance.

First, let’s address the elephant in the room: It is extremely unlikely that Republicans will be able to overturn the results of the election.

It is possible, yes, to come up with scenarios in which legislators or judges engineer a second Trump term and plunge the nation into a constitutional crisis. But even with a conservative Supreme Court, a Republican-led Senate and Republican-led congressional delegations in most states, election law experts are confident this won’t happen.

Here’s an overview of what will happen between now and January, how the Trump campaign could try to intervene and why it is so unlikely to succeed.

County or municipal officials — whichever level of government is responsible for election administration in a given state — must count all ballots, double-check the totals and make sure every valid vote was included. The exact procedures vary by state.

Those officials report their final tallies to the state, whose chief election official — often, but not always, the secretary of state — compiles the results and submits them to the governor. States set their own deadlines for this; a few have already done it, and the last deadline is California’s on Dec. 11.

The governors must send Congress a “certificate of ascertainment” with their states’ certified vote totals and the names of their electors before Dec. 14, when the Electoral College will convene. But there is a strong incentive to do it earlier, because results certified by Dec. 8, known as the safe harbor deadline, are largely insulated from challenges.

The Trump campaign could still file a lawsuit challenging results certified by the safe harbor deadline — anyone can file a lawsuit, even if it’s meritless — but the courts would almost certainly throw it out.

“Once you’ve certified, you’re really supposed to be protected from litigation,” said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School who specializes in election law. “There’s supposed to be this magic case that wraps around the state results after they certify, and we only open the case up to Congress.”

A primary tactic of the Trump campaign and conservative groups has been to use lawsuits and other maneuvers to try to prevent states from certifying their results, or at least delay the process. The idea is, in part, that if election officials can’t certify Mr. Biden’s victories in time, Republican-controlled state legislatures could step in and name pro-Trump electors.

In Georgia, Mr. Trump called for, and the Republican secretary of state authorized, a time-consuming hand recount, which could stretch past the certification deadline. Still, that deadline is a month away, and courts could step in if officials appeared to be artificially prolonging the recount. Mr. Biden’s 14,000-vote lead is an extraordinary hurdle for any recount to overcome, and he doesn’t need Georgia’s electoral votes to win anyway.

In Pennsylvania and Michigan, Republicans have filed lawsuits to block certification based on unsubstantiated allegations of voting or counting irregularities. But judges have roundly rejected the Trump campaign’s complaints so far, and Mr. Biden’s leads are well outside recount range: more than 50,000 votes in Pennsylvania and nearly 150,000 in Michigan.

Even if the counts were certified on time, state legislators could still, in theory, go rogue and appoint pro-Trump electoral slates to compete with the slates certified by governors. But Pennsylvania Republicans have already said they won’t do that, and even if they or legislators in another state did, it probably wouldn’t survive legal scrutiny.

“I think the argument that they would try to make is that there is an electoral failure under 3 U.S.C. § 5, that the election was essentially a failure, but no one’s actually tried this before,” said Jon Greenbaum, chief counsel at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, referring to the section of federal law that governs disputes over electors. “There would have to be a whole series of things that, in our view, would be contrary to law to get to the point where a Republican legislature could override the will of the voters.”

On Dec. 14, each state’s electors will formally cast their votes.

Most states have laws requiring electors to vote for the candidate they were pledged to (in almost all cases, the winner of their state’s popular vote), limiting the possibility of “faithless electors.” (There were several in 2016, but they didn’t change the final result.) The Supreme Court unanimously upheld those laws this summer in Chiafalo v. Washington. So that’s one less source of uncertainty.

One possible — but, again, exceedingly unlikely — complication would be if a state legislature somehow managed to appoint a pro-Trump slate and defend it against legal challenges, but the governor certified a pro-Biden slate through the normal process, producing two competing sets of electors.

In that case, it would be up to Congress to decide which slate to count.

But “I don’t think any of this is likely to happen,” said Paul Smith, vice president of litigation and strategy at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan voting rights group. “Absent some really clear justification, like some massive dysfunction, it’s pretty hard for a legislature to say, ‘We’ve just decided we don’t like democracy anymore.’”

On Jan. 6, Congress will count and certify the electoral votes.

In any remotely normal year, state certifications — by Dec. 8 or, at the latest, Dec. 14 — would be the end of disputes, and everything after that would be formalities. In all likelihood, that will be the case this year, too.

But in the unlikely event that state legislatures and governors appointed competing slates, Congress would have to choose.

Something like this actually happened in 1960: The governor of Hawaii certified a 141-vote victory for Richard M. Nixon, but a recount flipped the state to John F. Kennedy, and the results weren’t final when the Electoral College met. The stakes were low — Hawaii’s electoral votes had no bearing on the outcome of the election, which Kennedy won — but Congress did have to resolve the dispute. Nixon himself, presiding over the Senate as the sitting vice president, called for unanimous consent to count the pro-Kennedy slate.

In the theoretical 2020 version of this scenario, Mr. Greenbaum said, federal law suggests that Congress should favor the governors’ slates.

But let’s say Congress stuck to partisanship, meaning the Democratic House chose a governor’s pro-Biden slate and the Republican Senate chose a legislature’s pro-Trump slate. Even in the case of a congressional stalemate, federal law dictates that the slate chosen by the “executive” of the state in question would prevail, according to David Boies, who was Al Gore’s chief lawyer in the 2000 Florida recount.

There is some ambiguity, Mr. Boies said, as to whether “executive” refers to the governor or the secretary of state. But in all three key states — Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — both figures are Democrats.

The coming weeks may be chaotic. They may undermine public faith in the electoral process and cement Trump supporters’ false belief that the election was “stolen.” The damage to democratic institutions may be long-lasting.

But in the short term, it is virtually inconceivable that anything will happen but this: On Jan. 20, 2021, Mr. Biden will raise his right hand, take the oath of office and become the 46th president of the United States.

For months, Professor Levinson said, she has kept a list of “election nightmares,” none of which have come to pass. Interference by Republican legislators is the only scenario left, and she is not worried. Too many unlikely things would have to happen in too many states where Mr. Biden is ahead by too many votes.

“Find me the states. Find me the state where it’s susceptible to this type of shenanigans,” she said. “So many things have to go wrong for that to happen. You need the tornado to hit the hurricane during the 8.0, and I really just don’t think it’s going to happen.”

The Races That Haven’t Been Called,"More than a month after Election Day, two extraordinarily close House races remain unresolved.

Here’s an overview of the races — in Iowa’s Second Congressional District and New York’s 22nd Congressional District — and what needs to happen before the results are finalized.

This race — for a seat being vacated by Representative Dave Loebsack, a Democrat — was always expected to be close, but it would have been hard to predict just how close.

In the initial count, the Republican candidate, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, led Rita Hart, a Democrat, by 47 votes. A recount narrowed Ms. Miller-Meeks’s lead to just six votes, and Iowa officials certified her as the winner on Nov. 30.

Ms. Hart chose not to challenge the results through the normal legal process, which would have involved district courts and the Iowa Supreme Court. Instead, she took the unusual step of contesting the election before the House Administration Committee, which has the power to conduct an investigation and make a recommendation to the full House on which candidate to swear in.

The full House would then vote on whom to seat, with a simple majority required. The race will not be definitively called until all challenges have been resolved.

Former Representative Claudia Tenney, a Republican who was unseated by Anthony Brindisi in 2018, led him by just 12 votes after all ballots appeared to have been counted in New York’s 22nd Congressional District, which includes Binghamton and Utica.

But then 55 uncounted ballots turned up in Chenango County, throwing the race into even more turmoil than it had already been in thanks to the incredibly close margin and a set of 39 disputed ballots. The outcome may also depend on absentee and affidavit ballots whose validity a judge is expected to determine.

There will be extensive litigation, and potentially a recount, before a winner is declared.

This is the last outstanding race in New York, where the state board of elections certified all other results on Dec. 3. Four other races where results had been delayed because of slow counting — in the First, Second, 11th and 24th Districts — were all recently called for Republicans."
"A Time to Reflect, and Look Forward","Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host.

Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.

We have spent a lot of time writing, thinking and talking about politics in this newsletter over the past 26 months. (A lot of time: This is our 995th edition since starting this little project on Sept. 10, 2018!)

No one could have predicted how this election would go: a deadly pandemic. National protests over police brutality. An economic nosedive. A hard-fought, contentious campaign. (OK, we definitely predicted that last one.)

With the election finally over, I thought it might be nice to share the stage. We asked how you were feeling after the tumultuous political season. And did you ever answer!

We got so many thought-provoking responses about the future of our country and its politics that I couldn’t resist sharing some.

For Joe Massaua, a high school senior in Villanova, Pa., the election made him feel excited about what the future could bring …

We have pressing problems to solve now: Covid-19, a recession, racial justice and climate change. America is on a path to be more unified than before; we need to see it through, with actions from our local leaders and those on the national stage. We are one diverse American community. I sincerely hope those on both sides will put politics aside to work for the good of the American people.

… but Drew Currie, writing from Colorado, says there may be no way to patch up the country’s differences.

It’s time to find a way to split officially into two nations. Let’s avoid civil war. Let’s use words to find our way through a peaceful division.

Kate Landry of Hickory, N.C., worries about President Trump’s lasting impact …

It seems like Trump has ripped the Band-Aid off a festering wound of racism, ignorance and all-around anger and hatefulness. I’m sad and discouraged.

… while Martin Sherlock of Naples, Fla., blames the news media.

I have listened to the media bad-mouth and call the president all kinds of names for well over four years. I am waiting to see how you bad-mouth the next president! The media does not have any conservative reporter or staff, which I consider a big problem of division. Mr. Trump is positively correct when he says that it is all fake news.

Lee Cross of Fort Smith, Ark., just wants to get back to not thinking about politics …

I am looking forward to getting off this political roller coaster that we’ve been on for the past week and getting back to the ever-growing stack of must-read journals and want-to-read books. And since the Christmas holidays will be very much subdued this year it is my fervent hope that for once we can observe the season of Advent the way it should be observed. All of us need time for peaceful reflection and — no matter what our beliefs — hopes and prayers for the Biden-Harris administration.

… but Tom Levy of Oakland, Calif., says the fight is far from over …

For those of us who wrote postcards and letters, and phone- and text-banked to voters in Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Georgia to get out the vote — the election is decidedly NOT over. That’s because two Senate seats in Georgia are still up for grabs in runoff elections scheduled for Jan. 5. Take a break. Sleep in. And rest up. Because those of us determined to do our best to help elect Democrats to the Senate in Georgia are about to jump in across the country.

… and Richie Feathers of Boston is already worried about the race after the runoffs.

Instead of basking in the victory for longer than a day, I’m already worried about 2022, which, if history is any indication, will now skew red. This anticipated rebuke of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be especially frustrating because voters will claim not enough got done, but turn in their votes for Republican senators who ensure not enough will get done.

Sam Fisher, of Katy, Texas, sees some hope for political dialogue close to home …

I’m looking forward to the knot hopefully disappearing from my stomach and my hair ceasing to fall out! I’m hopeful because my oh-so-dear friend and my oh-so-dear cousin have polar opposite views from mine, politically speaking, and through all of this, we are working hard to listen to one another, learn from one another, respect one another, love one another and find common ground. And dadgum it, if we can do it, the whole nation should be able to!

… and Darrell Sabin, of Moraga, Calif., sees the healthy functioning of a two-party system.

I look at this election and feel more comfortable than ever that our form of government will last the test of time. This election showed that we have two healthy parties. The Republicans and the Democrats set records in voter turnout. Our country fortunately has both Republicans and Democrats. Neither party has all the answers. Both parties are wrong and both parties are right “some of the time.” One party corrects the other party. Messy — but healthy.

But Jo Baxter of Palm City, Fla., sees hopeless divisions …

I don’t see much hope in this divided, mean environment, when both sides can’t even agree on the facts of a given situation. I am thrilled about Biden’s election, but scared by the sheer numbers of Trump’s support. Trump may eventually move out of the White House, but he has sullied the Oval Office forever.

… and Jeanne-Marie Lane of Everett, Wash., sees an uphill battle ahead.

I am not actually looking for stupendous, noteworthy moments for the next four years. I am hoping for a return to communication and actions resulting from willingness to compromise on both sides of issues, because Trump won’t be in the middle causing continual conflict and mistrust.

It may take the next four years for all of us to recover, even slightly. To return to respect for each other. We’ve been in a war zone and it may take more than years to feel better about ourselves and each other and recover.

Ginny Swart, of Cape Town, simply wonders whether the nearly $14 billion spent on the election could have been put to better use …

The mind boggles. They could have fixed climate change for that. Fixed Iran. Fixed the health service. All that money wasted.

… and Lynn Alvey of Milwaukee speaks for all of us — especially those of us at On Politics.

Has it really been a week since the election? Why does it seem like years?

Readers’ responses were edited and condensed. Thanks, as always, to my colleague Isabella Grullón Paz for her help.

Will President Trump eventually concede the election to President-elect Joe Biden? Or is his refusal the next act in an unending showman’s routine?

The Times columnist Thomas Edsall argues that Mr. Trump’s “refusal to concede, and the support he is getting from his fellow Republicans, is part and parcel of the sustained drive by the right, especially since Barack Obama won a majority in 2008, to constrain and limit political participation by minorities by every available means.”

He writes that tactics such as “gerrymandering, voter suppression, restricting the time and place of balloting, setting new rules for voter identification and so forth” are not just part of Mr. Trump’s next act but the continuation of long-term Republican efforts. Yet they have not stopped Mr. Biden from securing commanding victories in both the Electoral College and the national popular vote.

All of this calls for “a reckoning,” says the Times columnist Bret Stephens. “Trump’s loss is entirely on him — albeit in ways that roundly indict the conservative movement that made him its hero.”

Mr. Trump lost not simply because of strategic failures, but also for “two main and mutually reinforcing reasons,” writes Mr. Stephens. “The first is that he’s immoral — manifestly, comprehensively and unrepentantly.” The second? “Conservatives never tried to check his immorality. They rationalized, excused, enabled and ultimately celebrated it.”

Mr. Trump needed reality checks in order to succeed, says Mr. Stephens, but he had only an echo chamber. And it’s that very echo chamber and lack of expressed disapproval from Republicans that has both sealed Mr. Trump’s defeat and enabled his refusal to concede.

"As a G.O.P. Playbook on Voter Fraud Falls Flat, Some Ask: What’s Next?","WASHINGTON — It was an election where Republican charges of fictitious voter fraud took center stage before, during and after the count, backed by a barrage of lawsuits intent on making it harder to cast or tally votes.

Yet by its end, Americans had cast ballots at a rate not seen in a century. A Democrat was elected president. And Republicans drew surprising support from Black and Latino voters — the very groups the party historically targeted with restrictive voting laws in state after state.

That a strategy Republicans long relied on largely fell flat, experts say, can be explained by the partisan divisions that drove record turnout, by self-inflicted wounds on the part of President Trump and by a pandemic that turned a gradual trend toward voting early — by mail or in person — into a stampede.

Some of those factors may be one-offs. But aspects of this election — especially the shift from Election Day voting to mail ballots, and the party’s surprising gains with some racial groups — raise questions of whether the Republican strategy of voter restrictions served the party’s interests as it once did. Also unclear is whether the changes in how people voted this year, in the middle of a pandemic, reflect long-term changes pointing to higher turnouts or factors unique to the 2020 vote. 

“Stereotypes die hard, and this Republican idea that if more people vote it benefits Democrats was at some level more true in the past,” said Norman Ornstein, a scholar of American politics and democracy at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. “It was certainly true when Republicans believed that white working-class voters were Democrats. But it’s a ridiculous stereotype now.”

Mr. Ornstein is a relentless critic of Mr. Trump and the Republican Party’s increasingly authoritarian bent. And nobody expects party leaders to quickly abandon a strategy that has served its interests from North Carolina to Texas to North Dakota. Republicans have argued that measures like voter identification laws, purges of voter rolls and limits on mail ballots are necessary to combat fraud, but ballot fraud is so rare that the rules often accomplish little more than suppress legal turnout. Even so, such strategies have long been part of American politics and are not going away.



“As long as the Republican Party is going to depend on whiter, older and more rural electorate,” said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine, “they’re going to make it harder for some people to register and vote.” Assertions of fraud, he said, fire up loyalists, increase political contributions and delegitimize Democratic victories.

“Already,” Dr. Hasen said, “Biden is going to come into office with millions of people believing falsely that he cheated his way into the presidency.”

But the election also highlighted how trying to place limits on casting a ballot might actually motivate voters to turn out. And even ignoring the toxic effects on democracy, some experts say, this was an election in which the results suggested that the Republican voting playbook may no longer be as effective as before.

Republicans in Texas outperformed expectations this fall, gaining inroads with Latino voters who are among those hit hardest by the state’s tough voting restrictions, which include a strict voter ID law that is geared to Republican-friendly constituencies and severely limited absentee balloting options. That cast doubt on the idea that Republican success comes from making it harder for Democrats to vote, said Joe Straus, the Republican speaker of the State House of Representatives until 2019.

That said, he added, the national party’s emphasis on discouraging voters in 2020 does not bode well for efforts to broaden its appeal. “That is not a good look,” he said. “Republicans ought to be the party that is encouraging people to vote and winning elections on ideas.”

Mr. Trump’s fact-challenged crusade against voting by mail, which he variously labeled “a scam,” “corrupt” and “dangerous,” “was a real head-scratcher to me,” Mr. Straus said. “Many Republicans, including myself, benefited from mail-in voting over the years.” 

Nationally, Republicans have embraced absentee voting more than Democrats have. (And Mr. Trump himself has frequently voted absentee, including in this year’s Florida primary). This year, however, Republicans followed Mr. Trump’s lead in the general election and shied in droves from voting by mail.

How many of them turned up at the polls later is open to debate.

“I think Trump’s discouraging mail-in balloting during the campaign may well have cost him the election,” Mr. Hasen said.

Beyond that, the president’s fearmongering spurred a flood of news reports that debunked his claims while teaching Democrats who did cast mail votes how to do it correctly.

In Michigan, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, said a presidential tweet in May that falsely accused her of promoting absentee-ballot fraud turned into “a multi-front education effort from all sectors on how to vote absentee and why it’s reliable.”

“We ultimately were grateful even for negative attention,” she said.

Other analysts suggest that the right’s courtroom campaign to constrain voting hindered Republicans as much as it helped.

The most striking legal victory for Republicans came in Florida, where a federal appeals court upheld the Legislature’s requirement that former felons pay fines and court costs to regain the right to vote. The ruling, undermining a referendum overwhelmingly passed by Florida voters, effectively barred hundreds of thousands of Floridians with criminal records from registering to cast ballots.

Even that ruling, though, may have had a boomerang effect. Some analysts suggested that the publicity surrounding lawsuits and other Republican voter-security moves, like the party’s pledge to deploy 50,000 poll watchers in battleground states, actually worked in favor of Mr. Trump’s opponents.

“One effect the pre-election litigation and rhetoric did have was motivating citizens to vote exceptionally early,” said Barry Burden, who directs the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 

A key question is whether early voting will change American voters — and voting laws — in coming elections. The coronavirus pandemic turbocharged a shift away from Election Day voting to pre-election balloting, both in person and by mail.

According to the United States Elections Project, 47.2 million Americans voted early in the 2016 general election, roughly half by mail and half in person. This year that rocketed to 101.4 million — 65.5 million mail ballots and 35.9 million in-person votes.

“The data shows in other states that when voters begin using the mail and voting early, they embrace the convenience,” Ms. Benson said. “We’ll certainly see in future elections the majority of citizens voting early. What’s unknown is just how high that proportion will be.”

In many states, at least, voting by mail proved a positive for Democrats whose supporters had often faced hurdles like long lines at polling places. In suburban Atlanta, Carolyn Bourdeaux won a race for a previously Republican House seat by 10,000 votes in a state with a history of making in-person voting difficult.

“We had to fight for every vote,” she said. Voting by mail proved crucial: In 2018, when she lost a race for the same seat by fewer than 500 votes, one third of all mail ballots in the state that were thrown out for problems like mismatched signatures and missing addresses came from Gwinnett County, in her House district.

Ms. Bourdeaux later led lawsuits that simplified voting absentee, standardized verification rules and allowed voters to correct mistakes. This fall, only 0.1 percent of Gwinnett County mail ballots were rejected. In 2018, according to lawsuits at the time, the county’s rejection rate was about six percent.

Legal efforts to restrict mail balloting gained little traction this fall, but that could be temporary. Speaking on a podcast this past week, the former Republican governor of Wisconsin, Scott Walker, said falsely that all major industrialized nations have “gotten rid of or don’t have ballots by mail.” Citing unspecified “shenanigans” in mail ballots this fall, he called for the United States to outlaw absentee voting in all but limited circumstances.

David Wasserman, an analyst of the House of Representatives for the Cook Political Report, questioned whether many Republican tactics denounced by voting-rights experts as suppression affected many votes this year. Nor was he certain that misfires like Mr. Trump’s assault on voting by mail meant much in the end.

Some Texans were outraged by a court ruling limiting each county to a single location to drop off absentee ballots — a decision that gave millions of Houston voters one drop box in a county the size of Delaware. But voters still could mail ballots to election offices, he noted.

“There are examples of places where Republicans have impeded voters’ ability to cast ballots,” he said. “But a dispassionate reading of what transpired last week was that this was a fairly smoothly run election in which voters had, in many cases, very short lines to cast ballots and many opportunities to vote by mail.”

Some on the right see Republican gains with Black and Latino voters as evidence that the Republican message on fraud resonates more than voting rights advocates admit.

In New Mexico’s Second Congressional District, “a Trump Republican retook the seat with a platform pushing voter integrity,” said Logan Churchwell, a spokesman for the Public Interest Legal Foundation, a conservative group focused on illegal voting. In Starr County, Texas, a poor, Hispanic area near the border with Mexico where authorities have campaigned against election irregularities, “Trump nearly split the vote in a county where the G.O.P. doesn’t really exist.”

And some Republicans even suggested that the party might do better competing for Democratic-leaning voters than trying to discourage them.

“We saw with Joe Biden’s nomination that African-Americans are not exactly lefties, and we saw with the Latino vote in South Florida that an argument against socialism can be very persuasive,” said Whit Ayres, a Republican campaign strategist. “So there are avenues to expand the Republican coalition if we are savvy enough to take advantage of them.”

He added: “That’s the part I don’t know. A lot of that is going to depend on how much of a sway Donald Trump retains over the Republican Party when he is no longer president.”"
"Trump Rebuffs Biden Transition Team, Setting Off Virus and National Security Risks","WASHINGTON — President Trump’s refusal to allow President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his transition staff access to government offices, secure communications and classified briefings prompted growing warnings on Thursday, including from Republicans, that keeping Mr. Biden in the dark potentially endangers the country.

On Capitol Hill, several Senate Republicans insisted that Mr. Biden should at least be given access to the President’s Daily Brief, the compendium of the nation’s most closely guarded intelligence secrets and assessments of threats like terrorist plots and cyberattack vulnerabilities. Their call amounted to an acknowledgment that Mr. Biden would be declared the victor in the election.

“I don’t think they need to know everything,” Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, said of Mr. Biden’s advisers. “I think they do need to know some things, and national security would be one of them.”

“President-elect Biden should be receiving intelligence briefings right now — that is really important,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, a member of the Intelligence Committee and one of the few Senate Republicans to publicly acknowledge Mr. Biden’s victory. “It’s probably the most important part of the transition.”

Giving Mr. Biden and his top aides access to the daily briefing, as Mr. Trump got right after his election four years ago, would address only a fraction of the problem. Mr. Biden will confront an array of complex dilemmas: bruised relationships with foreign allies, a weak economy and a sluggish recovery, perhaps the most high-risk period yet of the coronavirus and a need to distribute a vaccine to 330 million Americans.

The president-elect’s team is concerned that it is being shut out of planning for the vaccine distribution, a huge undertaking that the incoming administration expects to inherit the moment Mr. Biden is sworn in. His advisers said they have not had access to the details of Warp Speed, the project that has vaccine distribution planning well underway, and understand little about its workings.

It is focusing on logistical challenges and policy questions, one senior Biden adviser said, like how to prioritize who gets a vaccine and how to make distribution equitable along racial and socioeconomic lines — a priority of Mr. Biden’s, but one rarely discussed by Mr. Trump.

“Every day Senate Republicans continue to indulge the president in the delusion he didn’t just lose the election, they are undermining faith in our democracy, putting our national security at risk and impeding the response to the Covid-19 health and economic crises,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.

Mr. Trump’s stonewalling is already creating modest risks in the president-elect’s dealings with foreign leaders: Mr. Biden made his first contacts on unsecured telephone lines, without State Department translators or briefings about what those leaders might seek from him.

Aides to Mr. Biden said that so far, the risks were manageable. Mr. Biden’s decades of experience in Washington, including 17 years as the chairman or ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, means little will take him by surprise. But given the global tumult in the past four years, as one Biden adviser put it, “The risk is that we don’t know what we don’t know.”

Deprived of access to secure government communications by the Trump administration, Mr. Biden’s team of more than 500 former officials and outside experts has embraced workarounds, talking over encrypted apps like Signal to shield their conversations from the Chinese and meeting in outdoor coffee shops with government officials they once worked alongside.

The conversations are circumspect because of rules on both sides limiting their exchanges of information, participants said. But the Biden team will be relying on deep connections and old friendships that have kept up throughout the Trump administration, often with parts of the bureaucracy that Mr. Trump has referred to as the “deep state.”

It may be weeks until Mr. Biden’s so-called agency review teams, made up of longtime government officials with deep roots in the bureaucracy, are let into the government departments that a Biden administration will run starting at noon Jan. 20. Some issues can wait until a formal “ascertainment” is declared, giving them access to the offices and classified material that some parts of the administration have prepared, including the Department of Homeland Security and the intelligence agencies.

Combating Covid-19 may be the most urgent issue for Mr. Biden. His team hopes to carry out a national testing strategy, but it will have to start from scratch because the Trump administration does not have one. Biden advisers are seeking guidance from groups including the Rockefeller Foundation, which has drafted a national testing plan and is partnering with states and cities to expand testing efforts.

And access to the Trump vaccine distribution plan will become increasingly important as Mr. Biden’s inauguration approaches so his team can take over without any hiccups, said the senior adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal transition details.

Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said she believed the Trump administration should share vaccine distribution plans with Mr. Biden, ensuring that “as the president-elect is able to come in and bring with him a transition team, that there is that flow of information that we typically see when we have transitions.”

Experts in both national security and health security see the pandemic as a national security threat. They note that China and Russia are expanding their sphere of influence by promising vaccines to other countries in need.

“The Biden team is going to be responsible for that on Jan. 20,” said Dr. James Lawler, an expert in global health security at the University of Nebraska, who joined with a former Navy secretary and a former Trump homeland security adviser in an opinion article on Wednesday in The Washington Post. “It’s as important as what we’re doing with our strategic nuclear forces and what current threat assessments are around the world.”

Other matters also have a short time fuse. The last remaining arms control treaty between the United States and Russia, called New START, expires days after the inauguration. Mr. Biden has expressed a willingness to renew it, but his national security staff has had no access to the detailed discussions between the national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien, and his Kremlin counterpart, or to a team of State Department negotiators who have dealt with Russia on questions like future inspections and verification.

An array of newer threats persist, as well, like terrorist plots or brewing cyberattacks. The 9/11 commission concluded that the short transition caused by the Florida recount in 2000 hampered the Bush administration’s ability to deal with Qaeda plots. At the time, President-elect George W. Bush discussed the dangers of abbreviated briefings in an interview with The New York Times at his ranch eight days before his first inauguration.

In many ways, what is happening now, officials said, is a reverse of four years ago — when President Barack Obama’s team was ready with detailed briefings and simulations of potential crises (including a pandemic flu), and Mr. Trump’s advisers were unwilling to receive them.

Mr. Trump’s incoming national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who was fired within a month, did sit for reviews of urgent national security threats with Susan Rice, his predecessor. But other officials refused briefings, apparently not wanting Mr. Obama’s worldview to taint theirs. Secretary of State John F. Kerry never met with his successor, Rex W. Tillerson. Ernest J. Moniz, the Obama energy secretary, never gave his full brief to Rick Perry, the former Texas governor, who was coming in to oversee, among other things, the remaking of America’s nuclear weapons arsenal.

Now, Mr. Biden has loaded his transition team with many of the same officials who were ready to brief the Trump appointees. But they have not gotten far.

With Mr. Trump unwilling to recognize the election result and authorize the ascertainment that allows formal transition to begin, the White House Communications Agency is forbidden to run secure lines to Mr. Biden’s house in Delaware. That creates a risk that some of his conversations could be vulnerable to foreign eavesdropping. His team cannot use the government transition email system, and intelligence agencies have warned that the transition operation is a prime target for Chinese, Russian, North Korean, Iranian and other hackers.

The refusal of the General Services Administration to recognize Mr. Biden as the president-elect has also all but halted transition work inside the Pentagon and intelligence agencies.

Even as congressional Republicans avoided acknowledging Mr. Biden’s victory, they began to push back at the Trump administration’s refusal to grant Mr. Biden classified intelligence briefings, in their first significant sign of recognition of Mr. Biden and the need for a transition.

“I see no problem,” Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said on Thursday when asked about whether Mr. Biden should receive those briefings.

Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told reporters, “Yes, I think so,” when pressed as well.

Senator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma and a member of a key Senate oversight committee, told reporters that without an update from the General Services Administration by Friday, he planned to push for answers on the process for beginning to share information with transition officials.

“Both sides had access to the intel information through the whole campaign,” Mr. Lankford said, refusing to confirm that Mr. Biden is the president-elect because of the Trump campaign’s outstanding legal challenges and the need for states to formally certify results. “Both sides need to have access to the information because we don’t know who the president is going to be, so allow that part of this process to still continue just for the sake of national security.”

The prolonged transition will have other consequences, like delaying the start of background checks for many senior and midlevel officials, said John B. Bellinger III, a former Bush administration official.

“We felt behind from the beginning,” Mr. Bellinger said.

Senior national security officials awaiting completed background checks could not start their jobs until the spring and summer of 2001, a delay that made it difficult to hold senior-level meetings and make tough policy decisions, including regarding Al Qaeda and the Taliban, Mr. Bellinger said. Citing those transition delays, the 9/11 commission made recommendations to smooth presidential transitions and expedite clearances.

Fulsome briefing memos from the outgoing administration are also important, Mr. Bellinger said, even if a new administration is planning big policy changes.

“Incoming administration officials always want to fix policies they think are broken,” he said. “But it is important for them to know what the outgoing administration was already doing and why problems that may look easy to fix from the outside may not be quite so easy.”

Progressives Press Biden to Limit Corporate Influence in Administration,"WASHINGTON — The alarm bells sounded immediately among some progressives when President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. released the list of advisers this week who will help him with the transition at the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the $5 trillion federal budget and shapes regulations on everything from labor standards to air pollution.

Mr. Biden’s team included executives from Amazon Web Services, Lyft, Airbnb and a vice president of WestExec Advisors, a Washington consulting firm whose secretive list of clients includes financial services, technology and pharmaceutical companies.

“This puts us at a state of high alarm,” said Jeff Hauser, who runs a liberal group called the Revolving Door Project, which has been pressuring the Biden administration to stay away from not only lobbyists but also individuals coming out of the business world whom Mr. Hauser and other activists call “corporatists.”

His concerns are an early manifestation of a percolating and broader clash between the progressive wing of the Democratic Party and the more establishment members of Mr. Biden’s core team over the role of corporate executives, lobbyists and consultants in the incoming administration.

In a letter sent Thursday, liberal groups including Demand Progress pushed Mr. Biden to adopt the sort of sweeping restrictions that his more liberal challengers for the presidential nomination had championed during the primary campaign, urging him not to “nominate or hire corporate executives, lobbyists, and prominent corporate consultants.”

Their views are represented most prominently in the party by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has made reining in the influence of corporate America and Wall Street a front-and-center issue for many Democrats.

An early indicator of Mr. Biden’s efforts to navigate this divide will come when he announces ethics rules for his government, a move expected in the hours after his inauguration.

The progressive activists want him to adopt hiring practices that go far beyond policies embraced by former President Barack Obama, who barred officials in his administration from working on issues on which they had lobbied in the past two years.

The Biden transition said in a statement that the president-elect was determined to ensure that “public servants serve all Americans, not themselves or narrow special interests.” The transition statement did not take a detailed position on what kinds of ethics prohibitions Mr. Biden would impose on hiring, but it hinted that Mr. Biden might bring on staff members who have worked on behalf of various causes and interests in the past.

“Talent will be evaluated carefully to ensure important perspectives are not excluded,” the statement said. “Some of our nation’s brightest policy minds are also fierce advocates on issues from criminal justice reform to health care and workers rights.”

The fight over these rules started quietly over the summer when Mr. Biden’s campaign invited dozens of ethics experts, professors and others, including advisers to Ms. Warren and other members of Congress, to make recommendations about an ethics policy to be issued on Day 1 of a possible administration.

While some argued that the Obama-era lobbying restrictions could hurt a Biden administration’s ability to recruit people with useful expertise, others pushed for tougher restrictions that bar not only lobbyists from being hired, but also corporate executives and consultants who advise companies on getting their way in Washington but do not register as lobbyists.

Progressives started growing concerned about Mr. Biden’s personnel moves even before the election, when he announced his first list of top transition advisers. It included Jessica Hertz, who helped oversee government relations efforts at Facebook, and Avril Haines, who worked at WestExec Advisors and also consulted for the data-mining company Palantir.

Mr. Biden’s first big move — naming Ron Klain on Wednesday as his chief of staff — drew praise from Ms. Warren and some progressive activists. They had worried that Mr. Biden might pick Steve Ricchetti, a close adviser and former pharmaceutical industry lobbyist who served as his chief of staff while he was vice president.

Mr. Klain has corporate ties, too. He has most recently worked with Steve Case, the founder of AOL, in a venture capital firm called Revolution, and he warned in 2015 about the impact that government regulation can have on technology start-ups.

Debates over personnel are common in new administrations, as interest groups and factions of supporters of an incoming president jockey for influence.

But they are likely to be particularly intense in the Biden administration after an election in which the liberal wing of the party suppressed its concerns about what they saw as Mr. Biden’s cautious centrism out of a desire to defeat President Trump. The stakes are heightened further by Mr. Biden’s pledge to differentiate his administration from Mr. Trump’s, in which representatives from corporate America and Wall Street held prominent posts, and conflicts of interest abounded.

Mr. Biden has not always shared the left’s concerns about lobbying.

When he was vice president under Mr. Obama, Mr. Biden bristled at the strict lobbying rules, which he contended would deprive their nascent administration of experienced talent.

He specifically balked at an effort by Mr. Obama’s aides to try to block the vice president from hiring Mr. Ricchetti, a well-connected Washington operator who had also lobbied for insurance companies, credit agencies and others. Mr. Ricchetti eventually became Mr. Biden’s chief of staff and continued working with him after the administration ended.

Mr. Ricchetti became the chairman of Mr. Biden’s presidential campaign, and is reported to be in contention for a prominent administration post. Mr. Ricchetti’s brother continues to operate a lobbying firm bearing the family name, which has signed several new clients in recent months.

Several other Biden confidants with ties to Washington’s influence industry worked on his campaign or his transition team. In addition to the team’s Office of Management and Budget review team, those appointed this week to oversee the reconfiguration of other agencies also included a number of people who work for firms that lobby for an array of interests that concern liberals, including oil and pharmaceutical companies.

Mr. Biden pledged during the campaign to adopt strict ethics rules, pointing to broad conflicts of interest he said persisted through the Trump era. He promised a policy that addresses “not only the improper influence of lobbyists, but also any improper or inappropriate influence from personal, financial and other interests” that his appointees might have.

The ethics rules adopted by Mr. Obama in 2009 were considered the most comprehensive in modern American politics. They included for the first time a commitment to ban registered lobbyists from working in agencies they had lobbied in the prior two years, with limited exceptions. The White House also moved to routinely release a list of all visitors, so the public could see what corporate executives and lobbyists were meeting with the president and members of his staff.

But both sides soon found ways to evade these rules. That included off-the-books meetings between lobbyists and White House aides at nearby coffee shops. Other representatives of corporate interests avoided the “lobbyist” stigma — and any restriction on being appointed to a political post — by positioning themselves as so-called strategic advisers. That role allowed them to advise clients about how to exert influence on the government without registering as lobbyists.

Officials from such strategic advisory firms — including WestExec Advisors and Albright Stonebridge Group — are represented on Mr. Biden’s transition team or are expected to play prominent roles in his government.

Four people affiliated with Albright Stonebridge, which was co-founded by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, are listed as members of Mr. Biden’s agency review teams overseeing the State Department and international aid programs.

The firm, which says it does not lobby the U.S. government, represents a range of international clients, including until recently the Switzerland-based mining and commodities trading giant Glencore, which has been the subject of investigations in the United States and around the world related to corruption and other issues.

Cristina Killingsworth, WestExec’s vice president, is on leave from the firm while she works on Mr. Biden’s Office of Management and Budget review team. One of the firm’s co-founders, Antony J. Blinken, a former deputy secretary of state, took a leave in August to run the Biden campaign’s foreign policy operation.

Mr. Blinken is considered a possible secretary of state in the Biden administration, while his WestExec co-founder, Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defense for policy, is considered a possible defense secretary.

The firm does not name its clients. It has worked with the philanthropy started by Eric Schmidt, the former Google chairman, and with Google’s in-house incubation unit, Jigsaw. On its website, WestExec says its clients include a leading American pharmaceutical company and a multibillion-dollar American technology company that it helped with “safeguarding against trade tensions between the U.S. and China.”

“Those kinds of consulting shops take advantage of weaknesses in current laws, so there is no transparency in their clients and how they are trying to influence public policy for them,” said Danielle Brian, the executive director of the nonprofit watchdog group the Project on Government Oversight. “That’s exactly the kind of people who should not be in an administration.”

 

Progressive Democrats and advocates for tighter ethics rules have called for years for an expansion of lobbying rules to include strategic consultants, as well as executives who work behind the scenes to help corporations develop lobbying strategies.

Some participants in the ethics policy group assembled by the Biden campaign argued that the administration should widen restrictions on hiring to include not only lobbyists, but also strategic consultants, according to people familiar with the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Others said the administration should ban lobbyists for corporate interests, but allow lobbyists for unions and nonprofit groups.

The Biden transition team’s ethics policy takes a more case-by-case approach, barring participants who lobbied on the issues they have been assigned with overseeing, unless they receive waivers. The list of people appointed by the transition team this week to review agencies includes at least three who were recently registered to lobby for labor unions, as reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.

The pressure on establishment Democrats is coming from progressives in Congress too, including Ms. Warren and Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Raul M. Grijalva of Arizona.

“If the C.E.O. of a fossil fuel corporation should not be put in charge of U.S. diplomacy or an oil lobbyist should not be put in charge of the Interior Department under a Republican administration, there is no reason to believe that an officer or lobbyist at a major bank or financial firm should be put in charge of financial policy under a Democratic administration,” said a letter sent by 13 House Democrats last month to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.

Liberal political activists are pressing Mr. Schumer to help deliver on their demands, pointedly noting that he is up for re-election in 2022 and could potentially face a primary challenge from a more liberal opponent. 

But even some proponents of tighter ethics rules are starting to question if the demands by progressives have gone too far.

“I understand the desire to have people that are ideologically aligned,” said Meredith McGehee, the executive director of IssueOne, a group trying to limit the role of money in politics. “But when you start doing litmus tests on appointees it can backfire. You need to have appointees in the administration who can work with a range of people in Congress or you are not likely to get much done.”"
‘I Don’t Have a Happy Ending’: A Pollster on What Went Wrong,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host.

Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.

Over the past few days, there’s been much consternation over this year’s polling of the presidential race. How did we end up with a close election in key swing states after months of surveys that suggested there could be a Democratic landslide?

It’s a familiar crisis: After the 2016 election, pollsters faced a chorus of recrimination about missing the mark and conducted a major analysis of what went wrong.

Charles Franklin, the director of Wisconsin’s best-known political survey, the Marquette University Law School Poll, helped compile that 2016 report. He’s been involved with political polling since 1980 and has been polling his swing state for more than a dozen years. This cycle, his polls missed the mark again — though not by as large a gap as many of his competitors (including the New York Times/Siena College polls).

I talked to Dr. Franklin about the crisis of confidence in polling, the challenge in identifying Trump supporters and why the surveys got it wrong, again. As usual, our conversation has been edited and condensed.

You and I spoke last year about what the polling got wrong in the Midwest in 2016. Well, here we are again, with another poll-defying outcome.

The last Times/Siena poll of Wisconsin, conducted just days before the election, gave Joe Biden an 11-point lead in the state. Your survey had Mr. Biden leading by five points. He won Wisconsin by less than a point. What happened?

I want to begin with the obvious, which is that I know about my data, but I only know what I know from public sources about everybody else’s.

What we see in our data is that we have been getting the Democratic vote amazingly close. Almost all of the error in our 2016 poll came from a substantial understatement of Trump’s vote. It was clear that we were understating Trump’s vote in the suburbs, especially in the Milwaukee suburbs and to a lesser extent the Green Bay suburbs.

Flash forward to this past week. I was worried that we had Trump voters lurking that we didn’t find in 2016. So what we did this time is, for voters who said they were undecided or declined to say how they would vote, we used their favorable or unfavorable views of the candidates to allocate them to either a Biden or a Trump vote. If you were favorable to Biden but not favorable to Trump, we allocated that person as a Biden voter, and vice versa. (Three percent of respondents were still unallocated, most of whom were unfavorable to both.)

After doing that, we did a lot better this time than four years ago. We were off on the winner last time — we had Clinton up by six points and Trump won by 0.77 points. So a seven-point error for us last time. It’s a four-point error this time. That’s better.

We have the right winner but the same phenomena occurred — accurate on the Democrats, understating Trump.

That seems to be a trend in the polls again this year. Why did pollsters have so much trouble finding Trump supporters?

I don’t think this is the “shy Trump” voter in the way we’ve understood it, as people not wanting to admit they’re voting for him. Lots of effort has gone into finding evidence of that and it just doesn’t seem to exist.

I’m more inclined to think we’re seeing a phenomenon of some fairly small segment — 3 or 4 percent, maybe, of Trump supporters — who systematically decline to do surveys altogether. That would fit with the notion that some segment of his supporters are pretty anti-press, anti-polls and in a lot of ways anti-conventional political engagement. But they may also be people who are not, in fact, strongly identified with the Republican Party. My hypothesis going forward is to search for the evidence that there is this small but critical segment of the electorate.

I’m going to hold out one other possibility, which I don’t have the data for yet. And that is the possibility that there was a surge in Election Day turnout that we didn’t catch in the polling, given the partisan imbalance between early and Election Day voting.

So if Trump is no longer on the ballot, will polling become more accurate? Or has it simply become more difficult to survey Republicans? If that’s true, it would really complicate our ability to get a sense of the electorate.

The worry that we have is that survey nonresponse might become correlated with partisanship. One of the questions that I always get is: “I never pick up the phone if I don’t know the number. How can you possibly do surveys?” And my routine answer is that Republicans and Democrats alike hate telemarketing and scam phone calls. That has been the great blessing of the political polling industry. While our response rates may be lower, it has been an equal opportunity.

Over the last four years of the Trump presidency, we have not seen any trend of a falling Republican percentage of the electorate, which you would expect to see if Republicans were now systematically as group refusing to do interviews. So I don’t think this has spread to the broader Republican electorate. However, it’s certainly a worry, because if it should spread, it will make Republicans’ standing in the electorate look worse because we’re missing Republicans.

The Times conducted a large number of polls this cycle that had many of the same problems. We’re not blameless either. Is there a better way that media organizations should be using polling?

This is not sucking up, but I’m really impressed with the job The Times and CNN have done over the last couple of years. The thing that’s puzzling is that every serious polling operation looked for the hints that the polling problems of 2016 were still there. And it’s really worrisome that we failed to find those hints.

Alternatively, it may be that we were looking for hints of problems different from the ones we actually experienced. To quote a former defense secretary, it’s always the unknown unknowns rather than the known unknowns.

What I think will be very hard to convey to anybody outside the polling world is that this is a result despite widespread efforts to address the problems of 2016, not because of negligence and ignoring problems that we knew we had.

In a way that’s more disturbing. Despite trying to find sources of error, we failed to do it.

For the average consumer of polling, this looks like two huge mistakes in back-to-back presidential elections. Are you worried about the reputation of polling, especially in an environment where the president has politicized the polls?

Sure. How could you not be if you take this at all seriously?

Polling has had its bad times. The irony is that we had generally been doing better at election outcomes before 2016. You have to earn that trust back, and the only way you do that is to have the next election do better. And in 2018, by and large, we did do better.

But then you have an error in ’20 that undoes that credibility-building of 2018. I insist that the Marquette poll did better than most of the polls in the state. Relatively speaking, we did quite well, and we did improve over the prior performance.

But I don’t really expect the public in Wisconsin or elsewhere to take away a nuanced view from this. The obvious and not wrong impression is that the polling had a really bad year. That means that for the next four years at least, we’ll be talking just like we are today about what went wrong with polling.

I don’t have a happy ending to this story except, you know, wait for 2024 and let’s hope we do a lot better.

The Times Called Officials in Every State: No Evidence of Voter Fraud ,"PHILADELPHIA — Election officials in dozens of states representing both political parties said that there was no evidence that fraud or other irregularities played a role in the outcome of the presidential race, amounting to a forceful rebuke of President Trump’s portrait of a fraudulent election.

Over the last several days, the president, members of his administration, congressional Republicans and right wing allies have put forth the false claim that the election was stolen from Mr. Trump and have refused to accept results that showed Joseph R. Biden Jr. as the winner.

But top election officials across the country said in interviews and statements that the process had been a remarkable success despite record turnout and the complications of a dangerous pandemic.

“There’s a great human capacity for inventing things that aren’t true about elections,” said Frank LaRose, a Republican who serves as Ohio’s secretary of state. “The conspiracy theories and rumors and all those things run rampant. For some reason, elections breed that type of mythology.”

Steve Simon, a Democrat who is Minnesota’s secretary of state, said: “I don’t know of a single case where someone argued that a vote counted when it shouldn’t have or didn’t count when it should. There was no fraud.”

“Kansas did not experience any widespread, systematic issues with voter fraud, intimidation, irregularities or voting problems,” a spokeswoman for Scott Schwab, the Republican secretary of state in Kansas, said in an email Tuesday. “We are very pleased with how the election has gone up to this point.”

The New York Times contacted the offices of the top election officials in every state on Monday and Tuesday to ask whether they suspected or had evidence of illegal voting. Officials in 45 states responded directly to The Times. For four of the remaining states, The Times spoke to other statewide officials or found public comments from secretaries of state; none reported any major voting issues.

Statewide officials in Texas did not respond to repeated inquiries. But a spokeswoman for the top elections official in Harris County, the largest county in Texas with a population greater than many states, said that there were only a few minor issues and that “we had a very seamless election.” On Tuesday, the Republican lieutenant governor in Texas, Dan Patrick, announced a $1 million fund to reward reports of voter fraud. 

Some states described small problems common to all elections, which they said they were addressing: a few instances of illegal or double voting, some technical glitches and some minor errors in math. Officials in all states are conducting their own review of the voting — a standard component of the certification process.

Perhaps none of the Trump campaign’s claims received more attention than an allegation made over the weekend in Pennsylvania by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer. On Saturday, Mr. Giuliani held a news conference in the parking lot of a Philadelphia landscaping company and claimed that the election in the city had been rife with fraud.

The office of the state’s top law enforcement official said that there was no evidence to support Mr. Giuliani’s claims, and that the election in the state was “fair and secure.”

“Many of the claims against the commonwealth have already been dismissed, and repeating these false attacks is reckless,” said Jacklin Rhoads, a spokeswoman for Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who is Pennsylvania’s attorney general. “No active lawsuit even alleges, and no evidence presented so far has shown, widespread problems.”

What emerged in The Times’s reporting was how, beyond the president, Republicans in many states were engaged in a widespread effort to delegitimize the nation’s voting system.

Some Republicans have even turned to lashing members of their own party who, in their eyes, did not show sufficient dedication to rooting out fraud. In Georgia, where Mr. Biden is leading, the two Republican senators, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, both of whom are in a runoff to gain re-election, have called for the resignation of the Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger. “The secretary of state has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections,” the senators said in a statement.

In Washington, the losing Republican candidate for governor, Loren Culp, has disputed the Republican secretary of state’s determination that the election there was free of fraud. The secretary of state, Kim Wyman, has in turn challenged Mr. Culp, trailing by roughly 14 percentage points in the results, to produce evidence. “It’s just throwing grass at the fence at this point,” she said in an interview. “See what sticks.”

Democrats have more frequently been the target of criticism. Last week, the Republican leadership of the Pennsylvania state legislature called on Kathy Boockvar, the Democratic secretary of state, to step down. In Wisconsin, the Republican speaker of the Assembly announced he would form committees to investigate voter fraud in the wake of Mr. Biden’s narrow victory in the state, though there is no evidence of any. Republican lawmakers in Michigan on Saturday voted to issue subpoenas for documents in search of “election irregularities.”

Indeed, Republicans in all three “blue wall” states have initiated “investigations” or called for audits — which is redundant given the certification work already underway. Democrats say this is simply a way to undermine confidence in the results. 

On Monday, the Trump campaign accelerated their legal efforts, filing a lawsuit in the seven Pennsylvania counties where the president lost that claimed mail voting created an unfair, “two-tiered” system during the election — though the system is also in place in counties the president won. The campaign also announced plans to file another suit in Michigan. 

The president has kept up a barrage of Twitter posts with false claims about improprieties in Nevada and Pennsylvania, predicting he’d prevail in Georgia, where he is behind, and said Wisconsin “needs a little time statutorily,” though he offered no explanation for what he meant.

Nellie Gorbea, the Democratic secretary of state in Rhode Island, said the amount of attention on the election would make illegal voting extremely difficult. “It would be nearly impossible to do voter fraud in this election because of the number of people tuned in,” she said.

Voting fraud in the United States is extremely rare. The irregularities that do occur are often inconsequential, isolated in nature, and unlikely to alter the outcome of an election. The most significant episode of election fraud over the past several years involved an alleged effort to manipulate ballots to benefit a Republican candidate for Congress in North Carolina, Mark Harris, in 2018. The scheme forced a new election and an operative who worked for Mr. Harris, L. McCrae Dowless, is under indictment. Mr. Harris was not charged with wrongdoing, and denied any role.

In the case of the 2020 election, Mr. Biden’s margins in the blue wall states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin are all in the tens of thousands. Even in Georgia, where Mr. Biden leads by more than 11,000 votes, it would be hard to uncover enough voting irregularities to change who won.

‘‘We have not seen any evidence of fraud or foul play in the actual administration of the election,’’ said Jake Rollow, a spokesman for Jocelyn Benson, the Democratic secretary of state in Michigan. “What we have seen is that it was smooth, transparent, secure and accurate.’’

Still, Mr. Trump has been fixated on voter fraud since 2016, when he falsely claimed that vote stealing had cost him the popular vote, which he lost by roughly 3 million. In the election’s aftermath, he formed a voting fraud commission that disbanded with no findings amid charges of secrecy, bias and overreach.

Mr. Trump’s attack on the election system this year has relied on either outright fabrication or gross exaggeration involving the sorts of small problems that typically come up in elections.

In Ohio, for instance, Mr. LaRose said that while it was not unusual to discover a handful of improprieties in a statewide election, systemic fraud has not happened.

“In the past, I’ve referred people to local prosecutors and the attorney general for noncitizens voting,” he said. “It’s like tens or dozens of people, not hundreds. There’s no acceptable level of voter fraud and we take every one of those cases seriously.”



The tension over voting has been most palpable in Georgia. The Trump campaign and the two Republican senators have complained about transparency, which Mr. Raffensperger, the secretary of state, called “laughable.”

“We were literally putting releases of results up at a minimum hourly,” he said in a statement. “I and my office have been holding daily or twice-daily briefings for the press to walk them through all the numbers. So that particular charge is laughable.”

He added that while there were likely small instances of fraud, he did not expect it to be significant enough to affect the outcome.

The absence of any major findings of fraud or irregularities, and the willingness of even Republican election officials to attest to smooth operations, have also undercut Mr. Trump’s legal efforts.

In Michigan, the Trump campaign has sued, saying that their poll watchers were not given access to properly observe ballot counting in Detroit. But election officials in the city deny that, saying there were dozens of poll watchers from both campaigns inside the main counting center there.

Last week, a judge denied a Trump campaign bid to halt counting based on complaints about observers, dismissing key evidence as “vague” and as “hearsay.”

The accusations of fraud from the president and his allies were noticeably absent from states where Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans did well.

In South Carolina, for instance, the Republican incumbent, Senator Lindsey Graham, won relatively easily over Jaime Harrison, despite the fact that polls showed a tight race there. The South Carolina Election Board chairman John W. Wells said late Monday, “I have not heard of any” substantive allegations of fraud in the state, though he added he would await a final determination in the certification and protest process.

Asked if Mr. Graham was concerned about results in his state, a spokesman said the senator has “discussed states where the margins are close” but invited South Carolina voters to step forward with any “evidence of fraud or irregularities.”

Mr. Graham, a close ally of Mr. Trump, has taken up the president’s cause. He asked the Department of Justice to investigate claims made in an affidavit the Trump campaign shared with him from a Postal Service worker in Erie, Pa. The worker made allegations of impropriety at the local Postal branch based largely on a conversation he said he overheard.

Late Tuesday, the credibility of that affidavit came into question after the House Oversight Committee reported on Twitter that the worker recanted his story in discussions with the Postal Service’s Office of Inspector General. The worker later denied he recanted in an online video.

One of the secretaries of state who did not respond to requests for comment about the election in his state was Corey Stapleton of Montana, an outgoing Republican. But Mr. Stapleton did post a message implicitly addressing the president’s ongoing fraud claims. “I have supported you, Mr. President,” he wrote. “@realDonaldTrump accomplished some incredible things during your time in office! But that time is now over! Tip your hat, bite your lip, and congratulate @JoeBiden.”

Trump Is Not Doing Well With His Election Lawsuits. Here’s a Rundown.,"It is difficult to overturn an American election result, as President Trump has been reminded over and over again in the past few weeks. His campaign and his allies lost in courts and dropped cases in every battleground state where they filed them — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Judges have been unpersuaded by “strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations,” as a federal judge in Pennsylvania wrote in the latest blistering ruling against the campaign on Saturday.

A losing candidate who is within striking distance — say a few hundred votes — might get lucky in a recount. Beyond that, he or she would need to show systemic fraud on a large scale.

Mr. Trump has shown nothing like systemic fraud in any of the lawsuits that seek to block certification of Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory in the Electoral College. Some of the suits directly affected too few ballots to change a state’s results.

Others depended on the theory that differences among counties in verifying or including absentee ballots amount to a violation of a voter’s constitutional right to equal protection. Given how decentralized the voting system is in the United States, that argument has gained no legal traction.

Here is a rundown of the cases and their statuses.

Costantino v. Detroit

Filed: Nov. 9

Claim: The plaintiffs were two poll challengers — representatives of the Republican Party allowed to monitor the vote counting — who alleged fraud and misconduct during the vote count last week at the TCF Center in Detroit. The lawsuit asked the court to block certification of the election results in Wayne County (which includes Detroit), where more than 867,000 people voted.

The plaintiffs claimed that election workers were instructed “to not verify signatures on absentee ballots, to backdate absentee ballots, and to process such ballots regardless of their validity.” They presented five affidavits from other poll challengers who said, among other things, that they saw election workers enter Jan. 1, 1900, as the birth date of many absentee voters. The plaintiffs offered no corroborating evidence for the affidavits. They also falsely stated that Republican poll challengers could not observe the count.

Context: The plaintiffs misunderstood the process for verifying and tabulating absentee votes, according to Chris Thomas, the state director of elections in Michigan for 36 years before his retirement in 2017, who submitted an affidavit for the defendants, the City of Detroit and the Detroit Election Commission. He explained that election workers entered Jan. 1, 1900, as a placeholder when the computer system required them to type in a birth date but they could not access that information in the voter file.

Mr. Thomas also said that ballots received on Nov. 3 were entered on Nov. 4 after election workers discovered that they had not previously been fully processed. Finally, he explained that Detroit allows 134 challengers each from the Republican and Democratic Parties, and once those limits were reached, access for a new challenger was allowed when someone left the hall.

Status: Chief Judge Timothy M. Kenny of Wayne County Circuit Court denied the petition from the pro-Trump side. “It would be an unprecedented exercise of judicial activism for this court to stop the certification process of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers,” Judge Kenny wrote. “Plaintiffs’ interpretation of events is incorrect and not credible.”

Donald J. Trump for President Inc. v. Benson

Filed: Nov. 11

Claim: This is a federal suit that repeats the pending state-court claims of fraud and misconduct in Costantino v. Detroit. The Trump campaign is similarly seeking to block Michigan’s certification of the vote.

The decision to file a second case suggests that the Trump campaign is “trying to try the same case in multiple courtrooms hoping that somebody will provide an endorsement of their baseless conspiracy theories,” said David Fink, an outside lawyer for the city of Detroit.

Context: The plaintiffs submitted more than 230 pages of affidavits from Republican poll challengers. But they described isolated grievances and perceived irregularities, not systemic fraud. “I felt intimidated by union people who were staring at me,” one poll challenger complained. Another said the loud volume of the P.A. system was distracting. A third said a Democratic poll worker told her to “go back to the suburbs, Karen.” A fourth found it suspicious that most of the few dozen ballots he saw counted that were cast by members of the military were votes for Mr. Biden.

Status: The Trump team dropped the suit.

Bally v. Whitmer

Filed: Nov. 11

Claim: Four voters sought to exclude all of the votes cast in three counties from Michigan’s total based on allegations of fraud and irregularities. Without corroboration, the plaintiffs said that officials counted the ballots of ineligible voters. The complaint also included unverified accounts of software glitches and dead people voting that circulated on Fox News and The Epoch Times.

Context: This is one of the four suits brought by James Bopp, a conservative lawyer. The suits all claim that the unverified accounts of fraud amount to a violation of the plaintiffs’ right to equal protection, by “diluting” the power of their votes.

Status: The suit was dropped.

Johnson v. Benson

Filed: Nov. 15

Claims: Two voters who were also poll challengers at the TCF Center made allegations about the counting process similar to the ones that Judge Kenny rejected in Costantino v. Detroit. They asked the court to block final certification of the county’s election results until an independent audit had been conducted or a special master appointed to investigate claims of fraud.

Context: This suit repeated the dropped claim in Bally v. Whitmer of an equal protection violation based on the “dilution of the weight of Plaintiffs’ votes” because of the counting of absentee ballots.

Status: The plaintiffs dropped their suit a few days after filing it.

Donald J. Trump for President Inc. v. Benson

Filed: Nov. 4

Claim: During the ballot counting in Michigan, the Trump campaign sued to stop it. In an affidavit, one poll watcher said another, whom she did not name, told her that she was told by still other poll workers to change the date on which a ballot was received.

Context: This was one of a number of cases the Trump campaign filed in key states to try to stop the counting as the results swung in favor of Mr. Biden.

Status: At a hearing, Judge Cynthia Stephens of the Michigan Court of Claims characterized the affidavit as, “‘I heard someone else say something,’” and said, “Tell me how that is not hearsay. Come on now!” Judge Stephens dismissed the suit on Nov. 5. The Trump campaign’s appeal of her ruling was denied because it lacked the required attachments.

Stoddard, et.al. v City Election Commission of the City of Detroit

Filed: Nov. 4

Claim: A Republican poll challenger and the Election Integrity Fund, a nonprofit organization, sued to stop election workers in Detroit from hand duplicating ballots that could not be read by a machine. The suit also sought to delay certification of the results.

Context: This was an early effort to suggest that mail-in ballots were being handled to benefit Mr. Biden.

Status: Judge Kenny dismissed the suit on Nov. 6. “Plaintiffs fail to identify the occurrence and scope of any alleged violation,” he wrote.

In re: Canvass of Absentee and Mail-In Ballots of Nov. 3, 2020, General Election

Filed: Nov. 10

Claim: On behalf of a voter, the Trump campaign appealed the decision by the Philadelphia County Board of Elections to count five categories of mail-in ballots. Pennsylvania law provides that voters must sign and “fill out” an outer envelope (as well as include an inner security envelope when they return their ballots). This suit challenges a total of 8,349 ballots with outer envelopes that were signed but lacked other information, like the date or the voter’s printed name or street address.

Context: The number of ballots challenged in this suit for minor errors would not be enough to change the election result.

Status: Judge James Crumlish of the Court of Common Pleas denied all of the challenges to all five categories of ballots.

Pirkle v. Wolf

Filed: Nov. 10

Claim: Four voters sought to block all votes from Philadelphia, Montgomery, Delaware and Allegheny Counties from being included in the state total, claiming that the state violated the right to equal protection by allowing differing absentee balloting practices among counties.

Before the election, Pennsylvania’s secretary of state, Kathy Boockvar, advised county election officials that “curing” absentee ballots (the term for fixing mistakes like a missing signature) was permitted but not required. As a result, local practices differed to a degree. This suit claims that it was unconstitutional to allow some but not all Philadelphia voters to cure their ballots. The suit also cites Delaware County for allegedly giving in-person ballots to voters who were recorded as having received mail-in ballots without requiring them to sign the registration book at the polls. In Allegheny County, according to the suit, voters were required to vote provisionally when records showed they had requested an absentee ballot but not cast it.

Context: The election system in the United States is highly decentralized and gives considerable authority to state and county officials over how to run elections. As a result, it is common for states to allow some variation in local election practices and to allow voters to cast provisional ballots in a variety of circumstances.

Status: The law firm representing the Trump campaign, Porter Wright, asked to withdraw. . The case was subsequently dropped, along with the other three brought by Mr. Bopp.

Donald J. Trump for President v. Boockvar

Filed: Nov. 9

Claim: The Trump campaign is seeking to block the certification of the Pennsylvania election, alleging fraud in mail-in balloting and varying procedures for curing ballots among different counties.

The plaintiffs said “Democratic heavy” counties allowed voters to cure their absentee ballots while “Republican heavy” counties did not. They also said ballots were processed in Allegheny County and Philadelphia while poll observers were too far away to see what was happening. (The plaintiffs later dropped this claim and then tried unsuccessfully to reintroduce it .)

Context: On Election Day, Republican lawyers acknowledged in court that the party’s observers were present at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia when votes were being counted. “I’m sorry, then what’s your problem?” Judge Paul S. Diamond of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania asked. He granted a modest accommodation, ordering the city election commission to allow poll observers to move closer to the counting.

Status: U.S. District Court Judge Matthew W. Brann dismissed the suit. The plaintiffs “ask the Court to violate the rights of over 6.8 million Americans,” he wrote, referring to all the voters in November in Pennsylvania. “It is not in the power of this Court to violate the Constitution.” The Trump campaign is pursuing a narrowly tailored appeal.

Donald J. Trump for President Inc. v. Bucks County Board of Elections

Filed: Nov. 9

Claim: The Trump campaign and others appealed the decision of the Bucks County Board of Elections to count 2,175 ballots that lacked the voter’s printed name or street address, or the date of signing. The suit also challenged the inclusion of 76 ballots that arrived in unsealed inner envelopes or with markings on them.

Context: Like a number of other suits, this one involves a relatively small number of votes that would not change the outcome.

Status: Judge Robert O. Baldi of the Court of Common Pleas denied the petition and ordered all the ballots to be counted.

Donald J. Trump for President Inc. v. Montgomery County Board of Elections

Filed: Nov. 5

Claim: The Trump campaign and others sued the Montgomery County Board of Elections for notifying voters before Election Day to allow them to fill in missing information on ballot envelopes.

Context: About 600 ballots are at issue. At a hearing, Judge Richard P. Haaz of the Court of Common Pleas asked if the suit included any accusations of fraud. When pressed, the lawyer for the plaintiffs said no.

Status: Judge Haaz denied the petition to disqualify the ballots. “Voters should not be disenfranchised by reasonably relying upon voting instructions provided by election officials which are consistent with the Election Code,” he wrote.

Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. et al v. Boockvar et al

Filed: Nov. 4

Claim: The Trump campaign and others challenged guidance that Ms. Boockvar provided to counties before the election, allowing them to tell absentee voters they had until Nov. 12 to provide missing proof of identification.

Context: Pennsylvania law normally sets a deadline for six days after the election, Nov. 9 this year, for providing missing voter ID. Ms. Boockvar, the secretary of state, extended the deadline to Nov. 12 in light of a decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to allow absentee ballots to be counted if they were received by Nov. 6. The extension Ms. Boockvar allowed applied to only a small number of ballots with missing ID that arrived after Nov. 3.

Status: Judge Mary Hannah Leavitt of the Commonwealth Court ordered this narrow category of ballots to be excluded from the state count. None of these ballots had yet been included. This is the Trump campaign’s only win so far in postelection litigation.

Republican Party of Pennsylvania v. Boockvar

Filed: Nov. 6

Claim: The Pennsylvania Republican Party asked the Supreme Court to block the counting of ballots received between the end of Election Day and Nov. 6.

Context: In September, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that ballots could be counted if they were postmarked by Nov. 3 and received by Nov. 6. Republicans then asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block the Pennsylvania court’s ruling. In October, in a 4-to-4 split, the justices let the state court ruling stand. Pennsylvania’s attorney general, however, ordered the late-arriving ballots segregated from the rest of the count.

On Nov. 6, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. also ordered the late-arriving ballots segregated. In the end, there were fewer than 10,000 such votes. They have not been included in the reported state total. By themselves, those ballots would not affect the outcome in Pennsylvania.

Status: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that the plaintiffs did not have standing to stop the counting of the late-arriving ballots. The Supreme Court has yet to say whether it will hear the Republicans’ appeal.

Donald J. Trump for President Inc. v. Hobbs

Filed: Nov. 9

Claims: The Trump campaign claimed that some ballots in Maricopa County were filled out with Sharpie pens. A handful of voters and a poll observer said they saw bleeding ink on these ballots, causing an “overvote” on the other side, and that poll workers were instructed to press a green button on the scanner to accept the votes despite the error. The suit seeks to prevent the supposed “overvotes” from being included in the tally until they are reviewed.

Context: The suit involves only 191 votes for president. At a hearing, when one witness was asked if she had a basis to believe her vote was not counted, she answered, “Uh, I’m not sure.”

Status: The Trump campaign dropped the suit.

Stokke v. Cegavske

Filed: Nov. 5

Claims: Two voters, a poll observer and elected officials, backed by the Trump campaign, claimed there were problems with an automated signature verification machine in Clark County. One of them, Jill Stokke, said at a Trump campaign news conference, “I went to vote and was told I already voted.”

Context: The Clark County registrar of voters, Joe Gloria, investigated Ms. Stokke’s complaint and said that the signature on her absentee ballot appeared to match the one in the voter file, but gave her the option of challenging that vote and casting a provisional ballot. Ms. Stokke refused.

Status: Judge Andrew Gordon of the United States District Court for the District of Nevada denied the plaintiff’s request on Nov. 6 for lack of evidence.

Law v. Whitmer

Filed: Nov. 17

Claims: Without evidence, several voters, on behalf of the Trump campaign, alleged improprieties and fraud in the election system of Clark County (which includes Las Vegas). The plaintiffs objected to the use of a sorting and scanning machine used for signature verification. The machine rejected signatures at a rate of about 1 percent, which is typical for mail-in ballots, but the plaintiffs said that “far more” votes should have been thrown out, enough to shift victory from Mr. Biden to Mr. Trump, and asked the court to either declare Mr. Trump the winner or annul Nevada’s certification of the election.

Context: The suit’s generalized objection to the administration of the election was the kind of claim that usually must be raised before an election takes place, so that voters won’t be disenfranchised. The allegations about signature verification are also similar to those that Judge Gordon rejected in Stokke v. Cegavske.

Status: Pending.

Brooks v. Mahoney

Filed: Nov. 11

Claim: Four Republican voters sued over the process of absentee vote counting in several Georgia counties, seeking to exclude all of the votes cast in them from the state total.

The plaintiffs cited isolated instances of fraud. One voter, for example, said his absentee ballot was recorded even though he voted in person. The plaintiffs also claimed that several counties appeared to have more registered voters than their interpretation of census data would suggest was plausible. They cited a study that estimated from past survey data, but without proof, that thousands of noncitizens voted for Mr. Biden.

Context: Georgia has certified Mr. Biden as the victor in the state. 

Status: The suit is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, Savannah Division.

In re: enforcement of election laws

Filed: Nov. 4

Claim: The Trump campaign sued to prevent ballots from being counted if they were received after 7 p.m. on Election Day.

Context: This was one of the flurry of cases around the country seeking to limit the counting of mail-in ballots.

Status: Judge James F. Bass of the Superior Court of Chatham County dismissed the case on Nov. 5 for lack of evidence.

Langenhorst v. Pecore

Filed: Nov. 12

Claim: Four voters sought to exclude all of the votes cast in three counties from Wisconsin’s total based on differences in absentee voting rules among the counties. The suit objected to Milwaukee, Dane and Menominee Counties allowing voters who say they are “indefinitely confined” by age, illness or disability to cast ballots without proving photographic identification. The complaint also cited a handful of voters (identified by only their initials) who said they received absentee ballots without requesting them, and three absentee ballots allegedly completed after they were mailed to deceased people.

Context: This suit makes the same kinds of equal-protection claims as the ones in Brooks v. Mahoney, Bally v. Whitmer, and Pirkle v. Wolf. All were filed by the conservative lawyer James Bopp.

Status: The case was dropped, along with the other three brought by Mr. Bopp."
Georgia’s Close Elections Sent Republicans After a Republican,"ATLANTA — Brad Raffensperger, the beleaguered top elections official in Georgia, considers himself the most loyal of Republicans. There was no question which candidates he would support in last week’s election.

“I’ve only ever voted for Republicans,” Mr. Raffensperger said in an interview in his office at the State Capitol on Tuesday. “I’ve been a Republican, or conservative, you know, since I was a teenager.”

Indeed, since taking office in January 2019, Mr. Raffensperger, the secretary of state, has been a target for Democrats in Georgia’s high-stakes, passionate and bitterly partisan voting wars.

In his nearly two years on the job, he has championed policies to guard against a threat of voter fraud that Democrats say hardly exists. He has been the subject of multiple lawsuits, and of television ads blaming him for presiding over a botched June primary that left voters waiting for hours in long lines. Democrats have also accused him of “state sponsored voter intimidation.”

But this week, he became the target of his own party, with the state’s two incumbent Republican senators calling for his resignation and condemning the presidential election as an “embarrassment,” an allegation he called “laughable.” On Wednesday, he authorized a hand recount of Georgia’s ballots for the presidential race — a move championed by President Trump but one officials have said was unlikely to erase President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s narrow but significant lead in the state.

Now Mr. Raffensperger, a civil engineer and a numbers guy who received high marks from national experts on the smooth election operations in Georgia on Nov. 3, finds himself defending an electoral process that he said has no reason to be mistrusted.

Criticism has come from Mr. Trump and the state’s senators, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, who are each facing competitive January runoffs that could determine control of the Senate. The senators declared in a joint statement on Monday that Mr. Raffensperger had “failed the people of Georgia” and did not deliver “honest and transparent elections.”

“I was fully expecting it to come from the one side,” Mr. Raffensperger said of the criticism. But, he added, “not from your own ranks.”

It was a twist that few saw coming.

Mr. Raffensperger said he had no plans to step down, and emphasized that the statewide vote count was legitimate. There may have been “isolated incidents” of irregularities, he said in the interview this week, and his office was investigating those.

“But we have not heard of any widespread voter fraud,” he said.

The Trump campaign, however, has continued to claim that much went wrong in Georgia’s elections, part of a broader narrative of national voter fraud that has been almost uniformly rejected by elections officials from both parties.

On Tuesday, the campaign and the Georgia Republican Party sent Mr. Raffensperger a letter claiming “hundreds of reports of voting discrepancies,” including “tens of thousands of ballots being unlawfully counted.”

The letter demanded, among other things, a hand recount of the nearly five million votes cast. It also asked that Mr. Raffensperger “trace the chain of custody of the ballots from printing to sending, from receipt to counting” in an election that, because of the coronavirus pandemic, involved hundreds of thousands of mail-in absentee ballots — not unlike the situation in dozens of other states.

On Wednesday morning, Mr. Raffensperger announced a hand recount of ballots in all 159 counties, an order that applies only to the presidential ticket. Even if Mr. Trump were to win Georgia, Mr. Biden has already won the national election.

This week, other Republicans have also raised questions about the election process that Mr. Raffensperger has overseen. Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican and the former secretary of state, said Mr. Raffensperger needed to take “a serious look” at allegations of irregularities. All members of the 2021 House Republican delegation from Georgia made a similar request.

In his office on Tuesday, Mr. Raffensperger, a tall, silver-haired man with an austere mien, seemed both calm and cautious as he described Georgia’s predicament — as well as his own. Sometimes he looked to Jordan Fuchs, the deputy secretary of state, who reminded him of the first words of answers they had apparently rehearsed.

Asked if he thought he was being thrown under the bus by fellow Republicans, he took what seemed like subtle digs at Mr. Trump, who on Wednesday was trailing Mr. Biden by about 14,000 votes in Georgia, and Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Perdue.

“Well, in Georgia, you have to win over 50 percent, and then you’re not in a runoff,” he said of the senators. “And if you win big, this wouldn’t be an issue.”

The attacks on Mr. Raffensperger have cracked the facade of Republican unity before some of the most important runoff elections in recent American history. They also appear to be a way for Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Perdue to curry favor with Georgians who, like the senators, are devoted fans of the president and outraged about the vote count.

But the strategy also carries some risk. Telling Trump supporters the election process is rigged in Georgia could dissuade them from voting in the runoffs. And the anger over Mr. Raffensperger’s treatment is simmering among some longtime Republicans.

Leo Smith, a consultant with Mr. Raffensperger’s office and a former diversity recruitment director with the state’s Republican Party, called the criticism of the Georgia vote “an insult to those hard-working, committed Republicans who oversaw the election.” In an interview, Mr. Smith described Mr. Raffensperger’s critics as “people who were caught in this poor leadership from a petulant president who has lost, and is using his loss to bully other Republicans into complying with conspiracy theories about voting.”

Mr. Raffensperger, 65, began his political career on the City Council in the affluent northern Atlanta suburb of Johns Creek. In public, he exhibits a kind of punctilious blandness, with a voice that rarely rises above the dispassionate tone of a functionary behind the desk at a Department of Motor Vehicles office.

Even so he is considered highly ambitious, and observers note that Mr. Kemp showed how the secretary of state’s office could be used as a springboard.

After his City Council stint, Mr. Raffensperger, who is married and has two living adult sons and a third who died in 2018, spent a few years in the State Legislature. In his 2018 bid for the secretary of state, he lent his campaign hundreds of thousands of dollars, telling voters he would focus on “protecting our elections,” particularly from immigrants who entered the country illegally.

He did not garner more than 50 percent of the vote and ended up in a runoff with a Democrat, former U.S. Representative John Barrow, at a time when much of the nation had begun asking whether Georgia’s election system was truly fair.

A few weeks earlier, Stacey Abrams, a rising star in the Democratic Party, had narrowly lost to Mr. Kemp in her bid to become the state’s first Black governor. Along the way, she and her supporters had argued that Mr. Kemp had been helped by voter suppression tactics he had engaged in as secretary of state.

Shortly after Ms. Abrams’s loss, an organization she founded, Fair Fight Action, filed a lawsuit that claimed the state had dropped more than 100,000 inactive voters from its rolls. As a result of the lawsuit, 22,000 were reinstated.

Last year, state lawmakers passed legislation that lengthened how long registered voters could be inactive before their names could be purged. The Legislature also virtually eliminated a rule that signatures on voter registration cards had to be matched to other records.

Fair Fight Action has continued to take a central role in criticizing Mr. Raffensperger’s election policies in a state where Republican dominance has been challenged by a resurgent Democratic Party, fueled in part by changing demographics.

In April, Lauren Groh-Wargo, Fair Fight Action’s chief executive, criticized Mr. Raffensperger after he announced the creation of an absentee ballot fraud task force, anticipating the widespread use of such ballots during the pandemic.

When Mr. Raffensperger took office last year, he inherited litigation that challenged the safety of the state’s voting machines, claiming they were vulnerable to hacking, and was charged with introducing a new system. Its complexity — combined with no-shows by hundreds of poll workers who feared catching the virus — led to a meltdown during Georgia’s primary in June, with machine malfunctions and long lines.

Hoping to avoid a similar disaster during the general election, county officials, aided by the state and nonprofit groups, began a massive poll worker recruitment effort and Mr. Raffensperger vowed to send technicians to every polling site on Election Day. Voters across Georgia were inundated with the message that they should vote by absentee ballots or at early voting sites.

The result was record turnout in Georgia and smooth in-person voting on Nov. 3.

Andrea Young, the executive director of the A.C.L.U. of Georgia, praised Mr. Raffensperger’s handling of this year’s general election and characterized this week’s criticism as “voter suppression 2.0.”

“As a child of the South,” she said, “it just sounds like too many Black people voted and we don’t like it.”

But now those numbers are being questioned. Mr. Raffensperger said he only wanted to inspire trust in the system, even as it appeared to be slipping away.

“At the end of the day, half the people will be happy. Half the people will be sad,” he said. “But what our goal is, is that 100 percent of the people have confidence in the result of the elections.”

Trump Stacks the Pentagon and Intel Agencies With Loyalists. To What End?,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s abrupt installation of a group of hard-line loyalists into senior jobs at the Pentagon has elevated officials who have pushed for more aggressive actions against Iran and for an imminent withdrawal of all American forces from Afghanistan over the objections of the military.

Mr. Trump made the appointments of four top Pentagon officials, including a new acting defense secretary, this week, leaving civilian and military officials to interpret whether this indicated a change in approach in the final two months of his presidency.

At the same time, Mr. Trump named Michael Ellis as a general counsel at the National Security Agency over the objections of the director, Gen. Paul M. Nakasone.

There is no evidence so far that these new appointees harbor a secret agenda on Iran or have taken up their posts with an action plan in hand. But their sudden appearance has been a purge of the Pentagon’s top civilian hierarchy without recent precedent.

Administration officials said the appointments were partly about Afghanistan, where the president has been frustrated by what he sees as a military moving too slowly to fulfill his promise that all American troops will be home by Christmas. The Pentagon announced on Wednesday that Douglas Macgregor, a retired Army colonel and fierce proponent of ending American involvement in Afghanistan, would serve as a senior adviser.

The hires come as Mr. Trump and some of his aides have been pressing to declassify documents that would describe sources of information inside the Kremlin. The president’s advocates have long argued that these could prove that four years of allegations about the 2016 actions by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in support of Mr. Trump’s candidacy were a hoax, despite the fact that Mr. Trump’s Justice Department has indicted Russian military intelligence officers.

Administration officials said that Gina Haspel, the director of the C.I.A., could be next on Mr. Trump’s list of dismissals because of her long-running effort to keep classified a series of documents on the agency’s information inside the Kremlin. Among her biggest recent critics is Donald Trump Jr.

Most of the officials and former officials interviewed over the past day agreed that there was a large element of score-settling and attention-grabbing by Mr. Trump and his aides as they have defied calls to concede to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.

Kashyap Patel, Anthony J. Tata and Ezra Cohen-Watnick — three aides whose promotions were announced in a Pentagon statement on Tuesday — are viewed as highly ideological Trump foot soldiers. Mr. Patel has a long history of trying to discredit the investigations into Russian interference, Mr. Tata’s nomination was withdrawn over the summer in part because he had called President Barack Obama a “terrorist leader,” and Mr. Cohen-Watnick was quietly eased out of the National Security Council in 2017 after clashes with Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, then the national security adviser.

The three are not believed to have the stature to bully Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie, the head of the military’s Central Command, into initiating operations, whether overt or secret, against Iran or other adversaries during the final days of Mr. Trump’s presidency.

And a senior official close to Christopher C. Miller, the new acting defense secretary appointed on Monday, said that it was clear from Mr. Miller’s meetings with Mr. Trump that the president has deep reluctance in launching offensive military operations as his time in office nears an end. That is not what his political base seeks, and it runs counter to Mr. Trump’s calls to get troops out of so-called forever wars in places like Afghanistan and Iraq.

During a meeting at the White House, Mr. Trump’s message to Mr. Miller, the official said, was to do nothing new or provocative.

When jobs open in the last days of an administration, they are usually filled by deputies, whose only charge is to keep the wheels of government turning at least until Inauguration Day.

It was a sign of the changed atmosphere that when James H. Anderson, an expert on military strategy and missile defense, left the Pentagon after being fired from the No. 3 position — acting under secretary for policy — he was “clapped out,” or applauded by officials lining the halls. A report on Twitter by William Kristol, the conservative commentator who has opposed Mr. Trump, said the White House sought the “names of any political appointees who joined in so they could be fired.”

It is possible, some officials say, that what is happening is no more than résumé padding, allowing some of Mr. Trump’s loyalists to claim they held top posts, albeit briefly, or to cement some policy changes before Mr. Biden can take office and seek to reverse them.

Several current and former Pentagon and administration officials expressed concern that the shake-up could usher in a period of instability and possibly even overseas adventurism. But others offered a more prosaic interpretation of some of the events this week.

“I’m only 2-on-a-scale-of-10 concerned,” said Kori Schake, who directs foreign and military policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and served in the Pentagon under President George W. Bush. “It looks like the last gasp of vengefulness and cronyism from an administration that has always preferred unctuousness to qualifications.”

In his final weeks as president, Mr. Trump faces a series of decisions that could shape his legacy in national security. He must decide whether to leave Iran with far more nuclear material than it possessed when he entered office, a direct result of his decision to pull out of the 2015 nuclear deal that Mr. Biden has said he would seek to rejoin. Similarly, Mr. Trump confronts the likelihood that he will leave his successor with a North Korea armed with more nuclear weapons than it had before multiple summit meetings with the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and a China that is more expansionist, and more dismissive of legal constraints, than ever before.

Iran could also test the departing president. But if there are provocations, Mr. Miller, the new acting defense secretary, best knows one response: counterterrorism strikes. Mr. Miller, a career Army Special Forces officer who held counterterrorism staff jobs on the National Security Council and at the Pentagon this year before Mr. Trump tapped him to lead the National Counterterrorism Center in August, is facing a daunting challenge in assuming the helm of the Pentagon for which he has little training or experience at such a tumultuous moment.

Friends and colleagues say Mr. Miller is not an ideologue, but rather a career soldier and creative, unconventional thinker who impressed Mr. Trump and top White House officials with his deft handling of a portfolio at the National Security Council that centered on counterterrorism and hostage issues. On Mr. Miller’s watch at the council, a U.S. commando raid in October 2019 in northwestern Syria killed the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

After a brief afternoon at the Pentagon following his appointment on Monday, Mr. Miller spent Tuesday in meetings, including a weekly coronavirus update teleconference with the military’s combatant commanders around the globe. He also met with service secretaries and received several briefings. On Wednesday, Veterans Day, Mr. Miller gave his first speech as acting secretary at the opening of a new Army museum.

Pentagon officials point to one source of continuity, saying that, for now, General Milley’s job as chairman seems secure, despite his public apology after joining Mr. Trump in walking across Lafayette Square in June during the protests in Washington.

Aides have told Mr. Trump that he would face stiff resistance from both Republicans and Democrats in Congress to firing General Milley, who is in the middle of a four-year term as the military’s top officer. After the dismissal of Mark T. Esper as defense secretary on Monday, General Milley convened the Joint Chiefs and gave them a steady-as-she goes message. He did the same on a conference call later with the combatant commanders.

It is not impossible that the shake-up of Pentagon personnel could presage some volatile and dangerous period, to include even overt or covert operations against adversaries like Iran. But the push for any attack against Iran, for instance, would seem to need the heft of much more seasoned cabinet officers, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

It is possible, however, that Israel could see the next 70 days as a window to conduct significant attacks to set back Iran’s nuclear program. It is widely believed to have been responsible for an explosion in July at an advanced centrifuge facility. 

Any more significant strikes would presumably require a provocation, though the news that Iran now has enough material to produce about two weapons might be enough.

Rocket attacks by Iranian-backed militias in Iraq against bases where U.S. troops are situated have quieted in recent weeks, partly as Iraqi officials crack down in response to Mr. Pompeo’s threat to close the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, and partly because some power brokers in Iran want to give negotiations with the new Biden administration a chance.

“I’d be astonished if the D.O.D. firings were laying the predicate for military action, because there just isn’t time remaining in his term to get U.S. personnel out of theater,” Ms. Schake said. “And there’s the formidable bulwark of the American military, which would have concerns and surely consult the other civilian control, the Congress.”

John Gans, a former chief Pentagon speechwriter and author of “White House Warriors,” a history of the National Security Council, said Mr. Patel, Mr. Cohen-Watnick and Mr. Ellis were all veterans of what he called the Trump’s administration’s “war on government.”

The Pentagon, more than other departments, has resisted Mr. Trump’s directives, slowing the withdrawal of troops from Syria and Afghanistan, a breach that led to the resignation of Jim Mattis as defense secretary.

“The three men have risen, in good measure because they were successful at pushing back against the bureaucracy” Mr. Gans said. “These are the people who go in and do whatever they think is required to achieve his agenda,” he said. “They are true soldiers in the war on government, the war on what Trump calls the deep state.”

Biden Names Ron Klain as White House Chief of Staff,"WILMINGTON, Del. — President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. named Ron Klain, a veteran Democratic operative and a decades-long confidant, to be his White House chief of staff Wednesday evening, the first step toward putting in place his administration’s senior leadership.

Mr. Klain, a lawyer with deep experience on Capitol Hill, with advising President Barack Obama and in corporate board rooms, served as Mr. Biden’s chief of staff when he was vice president and has been seen for months as the likeliest choice to manage his team in the White House. Known for steady nerves, he also has a fierce wit, which he has frequently unleashed on President Trump on Twitter.

He was particularly critical of Mr. Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, having served as the “Ebola czar” under Mr. Obama during an outbreak of the deadly disease in his second term. A video of Mr. Klain lecturing Mr. Trump about the pandemic was widely seen during the campaign.

In a statement, Mr. Biden called Mr. Klain an “invaluable” adviser, noting in particular the work they did together during the economic crisis in 2009 and the Ebola outbreak in 2014.

“His deep, varied experience and capacity to work with people all across the political spectrum is precisely what I need in a White House chief of staff as we confront this moment of crisis and bring our country together again,” Mr. Biden said.

The choice of Mr. Klain, 59, who first went to work for Mr. Biden in the late 1980s when Mr. Biden was a senator from Delaware and Mr. Klain was a recent graduate of Harvard Law School, signals that Mr. Biden intends to rely on a tight circle of Washington insiders who have been by his side for years.

Advisers have said that the president-elect will announce other top White House staff in the coming days, even as Mr. Trump refuses to accept the results of the election, tweeting “WE WILL WIN!” on Wednesday evening.

Mr. Biden is not likely to reveal his cabinet picks until around Thanksgiving, several people close to the transition said.

As a political tactician, Mr. Klain is well versed in the levers of power in both the executive and legislative branches of government. But he will quickly come under pressure to assemble a White House staff that extends beyond the moderate members of the Democratic establishment with whom Mr. Biden has surrounded himself over four decades in politics.

Even before Mr. Biden’s announcement, liberals in the party had already begun demanding that progressives be given a significant voice in the West Wing. And the president-elect will also be pressed to fulfill his campaign pledge to make his administration “look like the country” by tapping people of color, L.G.B.T.Q. Americans and other minorities to be part of the White House staff.

In a statement, Mr. Klain said he looked forward to assembling “a talented and diverse team to work in the White House as we tackle their ambitious agenda for change and seek to heal the divides in our country.”

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, one of Mr. Biden’s liberal rivals for the presidential nomination, praised Mr. Klain on Twitter, calling him “a superb choice” and saying that he “understands the magnitude of the health and economic crisis and he has the experience to lead this next administration through it.”

Mr. Biden made his choice of Mr. Klain even as Mr. Trump remained defiant in the face of political reality, refusing to concede defeat and insisting that the presidential election was stolen from him four days after news organizations projected that Mr. Biden had secured the electoral votes necessary to win.

Mr. Trump and his allies — including most Republicans on Capitol Hill — have falsely claimed that the election was tainted by fraudulently cast ballots and a conspiracy by Democrats, poll workers and the news media. The president’s lawyers have filed lawsuits in several states and his operatives are scouring for examples of fraud even as Democratic and Republican election officials in nearly all 50 states say the election was fair.

In the meantime, Mr. Biden is moving quickly to demonstrate that the president’s unprecedented behavior will not interfere with the transfer of power that will take place on Jan. 20.

Mr. Klain clerked for Justice Byron R. White at the Supreme Court in the late 1980s and has been a fixture by Mr. Biden’s side for much of the past 30 years, serving at one point as the chief counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Mr. Biden led.

Mr. Klain was Mr. Biden’s top legal adviser on the committee during the racially charged and sexually explicit collision with the Bush administration over the confirmation of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. Many of Mr. Biden’s allies saw his handling of the confirmation — managed in large part by Mr. Klain and his team of committee lawyers — as one of the stains on his record in the Senate.

Mr. Klain took a detour to serve as Al Gore’s chief of staff while he was vice president and later oversaw Mr. Gore’s unsuccessful recount effort in Florida (for which he was portrayed by Kevin Spacey in the HBO film “Recount”).

But Mr. Klain has always remained close to Mr. Biden. In 2009, he became the vice president’s chief of staff, reprising the role he had played a decade earlier for Mr. Gore.

Mr. Klain’s experience confronting the Ebola outbreak during the Obama administration was newly relevant this year as the coronavirus pandemic upended American life and became Mr. Biden’s central message during the presidential race.

The Biden campaign leaned on Mr. Klain’s expertise as it drew a contrast between the way Mr. Biden would approach the pandemic and the way Mr. Trump did. In March, the campaign released a video of Mr. Klain speaking in front of a white board comparing the two approaches that has been viewed more than four million times on Twitter. A sequel, again featuring Mr. Klain in front of a white board, was posted in July.

In the last few weeks of the campaign, Mr. Trump sought to use Mr. Klain’s own words against him with a video in which Mr. Klain appears to admit that the Obama administration “did every possible thing wrong” during an outbreak of the H1N1 swine flu virus. Fact checkers concluded that Mr. Klain was speaking only about the reliance on a single vaccine, and was taken out of context.

Mr. Klain has gone in and out of government over the past several decades, at times practicing as a lawyer and later working with Steve Case, the founder of AOL, in a venture capital investment firm called Revolution. His initial agreement with Mr. Case in 2005 included the right to take unpaid leave in September and October every four years to participate in presidential politics.

“He can process a lot of information, focus on the things that matter and balance a lot of balls,” Mr. Case said of Mr. Klain, calling him “unflappable” and pragmatic when it comes to confronting a challenge: “‘Here’s the problem or the opportunity. Let’s narrow in on what matters and get the right team in place.’”

Mr. Case dismissed concerns from some people that Mr. Klain was too much of a Washington insider for this moment in history, noting that as an Indiana native, Mr. Klain often goes home for the Indianapolis 500.

“He’s been in Washington a long time,” Mr. Case said. But he added, “He’s an Indiana guy.”

Over his years mingling among the nation’s top Democratic politicians, Mr. Klain has become a specialist in helping presidents win confirmation battles in the Senate. During Mr. Obama’s first term, he played a central role in helping win confirmation of Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court.

He also developed a reputation as the Democratic Party’s expert on debate preparation, coaching virtually all of the party’s presidential and vice-presidential nominees during the last two decades. He made little secret of his frustration with sitting presidents — including Mr. Obama — complaining that they too often refused to prepare.

A memo for his clients that Mr. Klain prepared years ago has become memorialized as the party’s best advice for its candidates. Among the 21 rules that he outlined: No. 10, “Punches are good, counterpunches are better”; No. 13, which says that a candidate can lose a debate at any time but that “you can only win it in the first 30 minutes”; and No. 20, which warns not to say something that does not feel right.

“At that moment remember the advice that some elementary schoolteacher once gave you: ‘If in doubt, don’t,’” Mr. Klain wrote.

Throughout the 2020 campaign, Mr. Klain was a top adviser to Mr. Biden and was deeply trusted by a candidate known for maintaining a tight-knit inner circle. He was not especially involved in logistical, day-to-day decisions, but along with Anita Dunn, a senior Biden adviser, he played a central role in guiding Mr. Biden’s debate preparations and message.

A number of Biden allies have noted Mr. Klain’s experience dealing with economic and health crises during the Obama administration, when the country was reeling from the Great Recession. In the 2016 campaign, Mr. Klain helped Hillary Clinton prepare for debates, a task he began working on before Mr. Biden announced he would not mount his own presidential bid.

“It’s been a little hard for me to play such a role in the Biden demise — and I am definitely dead to them — but I’m glad to be on Team HRC,” Mr. Klain wrote to John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, in an October 2015 email that was later disclosed by WikiLeaks. A week after Mr. Klain sent the email, Mr. Biden announced he would not run for president in 2016.

Mr. Klain was also the inaugural guest on a short-lived podcast that Mr. Biden hosted this year, speaking about the pandemic. “I’m going to call on you a lot more,” Mr. Biden told him at the end of the episode. “You know, I call on you almost every day for non-pod advice.”

At a Biden virtual fund-raiser in June for Indiana donors, former Senator Joe Donnelly made note of Mr. Klain’s work on the Ebola outbreak for the Obama White House.

At the virtual event, Mr. Klain, it turned out, was not far out of mind for the former vice president. “As a matter of fact, coincidentally, literally five minutes before I walked into this makeshift studio, I was on the phone with Ron Klain,” Mr. Biden said.

Hints on Obamacare’s Future,"As Trump hangs on, his conservative allies mostly stick by his side — except for Rupert Murdoch. It’s Wednesday, and this is your politics tip sheet. Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.

The Supreme Court heard arguments yesterday in the Trump administration’s latest effort to strike down the Affordable Care Act, but from their questions, it appears that most of the law may be safe.

Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh both indicated that they favored upholding the bulk of the law, even as they appeared to endorse the administration’s argument that the act’s individual mandate was unconstitutional.

“It does seem fairly clear that the proper remedy would be to sever the mandate provision and leave the rest of the act in place — the provisions regarding pre-existing conditions and the rest,” Kavanaugh said.

If the law were to be struck down, about 21.1 million people in the country would become uninsured, a nearly 70 percent increase, according to the Urban Institute.

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris appeared together in Wilmington, Del., after the court heard arguments, seizing the moment to press their case on an issue that was central for many Democratic voters this election.

Referring to his work as vice president to help pass the A.C.A. in 2010, and to his family’s own experiences with health setbacks, Biden blasted the Trump administration for trying to strike down a law that Republicans in Congress have failed numerous times to repeal.

“This effort to bypass the will of the American people, the verdict of the courts in the past, the judgments of Congress, in my view is simply cruel — and needlessly divisive,” he said.

As President Trump continues to deny his loss in last week’s election, it’s increasingly feeling as if his administration is living in an alternate reality.

In his first public statements on the matter since Election Day, Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, acted oblivious to the election’s legitimate results. “There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,” Pompeo said.

And the White House is continuing to work toward a budget proposal for next year that would be presented to Congress in February, weeks after Biden is expected to take office, according to a spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management and Budget.

Meanwhile, Trump is restaffing a number of leadership roles in national security and intelligence. In addition to firing Mark Esper, the defense secretary, this week, he has removed the heads of three other agencies while appointing loyalists to run key positions at the National Security Agency and the Pentagon.

The directors of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. are both at risk of being dismissed, according to senior officials.

This has all created a headache for senior lawyers at two major firms representing the president in his crusade to challenge the election’s outcome. They have begun raising internal concerns, worrying out loud that they may be complicit in an effort to undermine democracy. Up to this point, though, the firms’ leaders have generally looked past their worries about working with Trump.

And a similar reluctance to challenge the president runs through the Republican caucus on Capitol Hill, where all but four G.O.P. senators have refused to accept the election results.

Vice President Mike Pence met with Republican senators yesterday at a luncheon, explaining the administration’s legal approach and affirming that the president would continue to fight the result.

Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, didn’t exactly sound thrilled as he spoke to reporters after the luncheon. But like most of the rest of his Republican colleagues — held in thrall by the president’s power over his millions of supporters, and fearful of incurring his wrath — McConnell vowed to soldier on. “We’re going to get through this period and we’ll swear in the winner,” he said, “just like we have every four years.”

According to a range of state officials across the country, both Democrats and Republicans, this election was an almost unmitigated success.

Our reporters Nick Corasaniti, Reid J. Epstein and Jim Rutenberg called officials in all 50 states, and what they found was consensus: There was no meaningful evidence that voter fraud or other improprieties had played any role in the election’s outcome.

“There’s a great human capacity for inventing things that aren’t true about elections,” said Frank LaRose, Ohio’s secretary of state and a Republican. “The conspiracy theories and rumors and all those things run rampant. For some reason, elections breed that type of mythology.”

Here’s one result Republicans probably don’t want to contest: Thom Tillis, the G.O.P. senator from North Carolina, effectively secured a second term in office after his Democratic challenger, Cal Cunningham, conceded yesterday. (The race still hasn’t been officially called, but Tillis is leading by nearly 100,000 votes.)

Tillis had been seen as one of the most endangered incumbents in the Senate, with Cunningham, a 47-year-old former state senator, running ahead of him in most polls. Those surveys didn’t show much drop in Cunningham’s support even after it emerged that he had sent romantic texts over the summer to a woman who is not his wife. But like many polls this cycle, they were proved wrong.

Tillis’s victory guarantees the Republicans at least 49 seats in the Senate, with one race still uncalled (but favoring the G.O.P. candidate) in Alaska, and two more heading to runoffs in Georgia. By all likelihood, those runoff elections, set for January, will determine which party controls the chamber.

Progressive groups want to make sure a Biden presidency doesn’t forget about the left-leaning supporters who helped put him in the White House — even if most of them didn’t vote for him in the primary.

Justice Democrats and the Sunrise Movement, two leading organizations of young activists, went public this morning with a list of recommendations to Biden calling on him to name progressive figures to top government posts. Elizabeth Warren, they wrote, should be named Treasury secretary, and Bernie Sanders should become labor secretary. (Here’s an extensive rundown of who’s being considered for top posts under Biden.)

Progressive groups coalesced around Biden’s candidacy this year in a way that they had not in 2016, when Hillary Clinton was on the ballot. But in the days since the election, the rift that has increasingly defined Democratic politics in recent years — between a moderate, corporate-backed party establishment and a youthful, government-interventionist left wing — has surfaced again, making it clear that Biden’s knack for consensus-building will be needed in more than just his overtures to Republicans.

In his efforts to paint the election as illegitimate, Trump may have thought he could count on Rupert Murdoch. After all, more than arguably any other force in American politics, Murdoch’s media empire served to seed the ground for Trump’s brand of reality-denying, screen-savvy political domination — and then defended his narratives once he reached the Oval Office.

But in the past week, as our media correspondent Michael M. Grynbaum reports, Murdoch’s publications — from Fox News to The New York Post to The Wall Street Journal — have broadly refused to take the bait as the president pushes a series of vague, nonspecific arguments about election fraud and mismanagement.

Fox has refused, despite the Trump campaign’s calls to Murdoch himself in England, to retract its call of Arizona for Biden. The Post emblazoned its front page on Sunday with the words “IT’S JOE TIME,” accompanied by an image of Biden posing and beaming. And The Journal’s editorial page has been gently urging Trump to gracefully accept defeat.

Not all of Fox’s anchors are ready to move on. Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity have criticized some of their colleagues on-air for pushing back against the Trump team’s falsehoods. But the Murdoch empire appears more or less prepared to confront a new day, with Biden in the White House.

As one longtime Murdoch lieutenant told Michael, “They don’t tend to back losers.”

"U.S. Tried a More Aggressive Cyberstrategy, and the Feared Attacks Never Came","From its sprawling new war room inside Fort Meade, not far from Baltimore-Washington International Airport in Maryland, United States Cyber Command dived deep into Russian and Iranian networks in the months before the election, temporarily paralyzing some and knocking ransomware tools offline.

Then it stole Iran’s game plan and, without disclosing the intelligence coup behind the theft, made public a part of Tehran’s playbook when the Iranians began to carry it out.

Now, nearly a week after the polls closed, it is clear that all the warnings of a crippling cyberattack on election infrastructure, or an overwhelming influence operation aimed at American voters, did not come to pass. There were no breaches of voting machines and only modest efforts, it appears, to get inside registration systems.

 Interviews with government officials and other experts suggest a number of reasons for the apparent success.

One may be that the United States’ chief adversaries were deterred, convinced that the voting infrastructure was so hardened, Facebook and Twitter were so on alert, and Cyber Command and a small group of American companies were so on the offensive that it was not worth the risk.

But there is another explanation as well: In the 2020 election the distinction between foreign and domestic interference blurred. From early in the campaign, President Trump did more to undermine confidence in the system’s integrity than America’s rivals could have done themselves.

And in the aftermath, Mr. Trump’s baseless accusations, amplified by conservative news media outlets, have only intensified, leaving the Russians and the Iranians with the relatively easy task of bouncing his messages back into the echo chamber of social media.

“A lot of the disinformation that voters consume originates from within our own country,” said Jeh C. Johnson, a secretary of homeland security under President Barack Obama. “All foreign adversaries need to do is aid and abet and amplify.”

Mr. Trump and his allies, it turns out, were the chief purveyors of the kind of election misinformation that the F.B.I., the Department of Homeland Security and American intelligence officials were warning about. He was also the one actor they could not mention, much less try to neutralize. That was left to the online platforms, mostly Twitter, which placed warnings on many of his posts.

In an Election Day conversation with journalists, Gen. Paul M. Nakasone, the commander of Cyber Command and the director of the National Security Agency, said he was “very confident in the actions that have been taken against adversaries over the last several weeks and several months to ensure they are not going to interfere in our elections.”

He said the National Security Agency was also watching for efforts by foreign adversaries to prod extremist groups to violence — a concern that remains.

Yet over the subsequent few days, before the election was called in favor of Joseph R. Biden Jr., General Nakasone and other officials avoided questions about whether their commander in chief was feeding the very forces they were working to defeat.

In interviews, Democrats and Republicans who have been deeply involved in the effort to harden American defenses and put the United States on offense say it is possible that the country is beginning to figure out what works to deter cyberattacks.

They give credit to General Nakasone and Christopher Krebs, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at the Department of Homeland Security. Mr. Krebs spent the past two years persuading states and social media companies to bolster their defenses against attacks.

Once the election is officially certified, the military will complete its “after action” reports. The most interesting will most likely be classified. But in interviews with a variety of key players, a few lessons are already emerging.

The first is that General Nakasone’s aggressive new posture — which Cyber Command describes with terms like “persistent engagement” and “defend forward” — may be working. The phrases refer to going deep inside the computer networks of adversaries, whether that means the Internet Research Agency, the Russia-based group that mounted the 2016 influence campaigns; the G.R.U., Russia’s military intelligence agency; or Iran’s increasingly active cybercorps.

Once inside, Cyber Command can use its access to hunt for operations that are being planned — or to conduct what amount to pre-emptive strikes.

The United States has launched such strikes before, of course, against Iran’s nuclear program, North Korea’s missiles and, during the 2018 elections, the Internet Research Agency, which ran the influence campaign that aided Mr. Trump in 2016. But there was no significant cyberretaliation, at least that became public, ordered by the Obama administration surrounding the 2016 election, even though the administration knew that Russian actors were stealing data and scanning voter registration systems.

This time General Nakasone did not wait for much evidence to roll in before acting.

He went after Trickbot, a widely used set of tools written by Russian-speaking criminal groups that he believed could be used to lock up registration systems or computer sites of secretaries of state, which count ballots.

So did Microsoft, which obtained court orders against Trickbot. Together, the military and private sector actions, which appear to have been largely uncoordinated, disrupted the network of the criminal groups in October, leaving them hampered in any potential attacks against election infrastructure.

Officials familiar with the operations say there were also attacks directed at a Russian state-run group called Energetic Bear, or Dragonfly, that has long been inside American electric utilities and has redirected its hacking skills toward state and local governments.

Senator Angus King, a Maine independent who helped lead a bipartisan effort to draw lessons from the rising tempo of cyberattacks, said Cyber Command’s more active approach had an effect.

“I have felt for years what was lacking in our cyberdefense was a deterrent,” Mr. King said. “And we are getting closer to having that deterrent. I want our adversaries to have to think hard about what they are going to do because they know there is going to be some results that will be a cost to be paid.”

General Nakasone would not confirm specific operations. But he said he would take his victories in small doses, by knocking adversaries offline, even temporarily, to make it hard for them to launch an attack. “I look at it more as are we imposing a degree of costs that is making it more difficult for them to do their operations?” he said.

So did Mr. Krebs, who worked on shoring up defenses at home.

Mostly that meant placing federal government sensors on many computer networks and getting cities and states, which were easy targets four years ago, to toughen up. 

By the week before the election, Mr. Krebs came to believe that the Russians might want to sit out this election, since everyone was looking for their actions.

“I wouldn’t tell you we are going to stop them,” he said a few weeks ago. “But we can make it a lot harder to attack,” a process that some strategists call “deterrence by denial” because the attackers cannot gain enough access to alter events — or in this case votes.

Mr. Krebs, said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, “made the case to registrars and secretaries of state around the country, including some pretty right-wing ones, that the threat was real.”

Another big change in strategy this year was a willingness to expose adversaries publicly. It is something the Obama administration was also reluctant to do in 2016, when it avoided naming China as the country that stole 22 million files on government employees, or Russia as the source of attacks on the Pentagon, the White House and the State Department.

This year, William R. Evanina, the official put in charge of election security by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, called out Russia, China and Iran for their efforts to interfere in the elections.

Though criticized by Democrats for not being specific enough, and appearing to equate Iran with much more talented cyberadversaries, Mr. Evanina’s releases put both the public and America’s rivals on notice about what was afoot, including warning that Russia was again trying to assist Mr. Trump.

Mr. Evanina’s announcements in July and August were followed by an announcement in October by John Ratcliffe, the director of national intelligence, that Russian groups had probed state and local networks and that Iran had tried to influence the election by sending spoofed emails as part of a campaign he said was intended to hurt Mr. Trump.

“Naming and shaming the bad actors that are trying to mess with us is a key part of a coherent deterrence strategy,” said Representative Mike Gallagher, the Wisconsin Republican who along with Mr. King led the Cybersecurity Solarium Commission.

Mr. Ratcliffe’s announcement was followed by Cyber Command’s secret operations to interfere with the operations of the Russian group and take down, at least temporarily, the Iranian hacking group tied to Tehran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.

American officials said that while Iran opposed Mr. Trump’s re-election, its hackers were hardly playing at Russia’s level. The emails and text messages they tried to send to Americans contained so many spelling, syntax and grammatical errors that they seemed unlikely to fool their targets. Even had they not been taken offline, they posed no threat to turn the result of the elections.

It is evidence of why Iran, as multiple U.S. officials noted, remains far less of a threat than Russia.

Iran’s actions were an attempt to “rattle our cage” and not a real attempt to change outcomes, said Glenn S. Gerstell, a former general counsel of the National Security Agency.

"Before Harris, This Vice President Broke a Racial Barrier","Kamala Harris broke gender and racial barriers this year as the first woman, first Black person and first person of Asian descent to be elected vice president.

But historians and Native Americans are also revisiting the legacy of Charles Curtis, whose Kaw Nation ancestry gives him a claim as the first “person of color” to serve as vice president, though the term’s current usage emerged decades later.

Mr. Curtis, who served under President Herbert Hoover from 1929 to 1933, often referred to the novelty of his background while in public office, speaking of his rise “from Kaw tepee to Capitol,” as his Senate biography notes.

Native artifacts adorned his office, he posed for photographs in a Native headdress, and he referred to himself as “one-eighth Kaw Indian and a one-hundred percent Republican,” the biography says.

His embrace of his heritage, however, also came with a legacy that some historians and advocates say undermined Native land rights.

Mr. Curtis was born in 1860 in the territory of Kansas to a white father and a mother of Kanza descent, and spent his early life among the Kanza people, who are now part of the Kaw Nation.

He learned the language and excelled at horsemanship, according to the Senate. And he pursued his early education in Topeka, shuttling back and forth between the city and the reservation, said Crystal Douglas, who runs the Kanza Museum in Kaw City, Okla.

Mr. Curtis was eventually elected a county attorney, and to the Senate and the House of Representatives. Mr. Hoover chose him as a running mate in 1928, possibly because of his popularity in the pastoral Midwest.

Many Native leaders thought a man who grew up with a tribe would look out for their interests. But parts of his legacy, historians say, are overshadowed by his role as the original author of the Curtis Act of 1898, which orchestrated allotment of Native lands and curtailed tribal leadership.

“There is pride with the Kanza, that one of theirs rose to be vice president of the United States,” said Mark Brooks, an administrator for the Kaw Mission in the Kansas State Historical Society. “But I would say that some would pick that apart and refer to the Curtis Act and what it actually did.”

According to original documents provided by the historical society, Mr. Curtis is referred to as “one of our own men” by a tribal leader, Chief Washungah, who spoke at the Capitol in 1900 about the tribe’s share of lands under treaties with the federal government.

“The white people are getting rich off of the lands that have been treated away,” Chief Washungah told Commissioner of Indian Affairs William A. Jones, according to the documents.

He added: “I am getting old and I realize that I cannot live much longer, so I am talking for the children now. I want them to stay on the land, and to get some good land.”

Mr. Jones, in return, told the chief that “your matters have been carefully looked after by your representative in Congress,” in a reference to Mr. Curtis.

Mr. Curtis also had Osage ancestry, according to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

Ms. Douglas, the Kanza Museum director, said that Mr. Curtis “did some wonderful things” for his people, and introduced bills backing women’s voting rights and child labor laws. She said that Mr. Curtis’s personal papers show he was “disappointed” with how the Curtis Act ultimately harmed tribal identity.

Dr. R. David Edmunds, a retired historian at the University of Texas in Dallas, said that Mr. Curtis represented the 19th-century approach of U.S. policy toward Native people.

“Curtis is the last gasp of the old way, and the country moves away from him,” he said. “He has sort of been forgotten because of that.”

In 1936, when the coffin bearing the body of Mr. Curtis was transported by train from Washington to Kansas, “thousands” were expected to pay respects, according to The New York Times’s coverage of his funeral.

Then he faded into relative obscurity, until this year, as Ms. Harris’s selection on a major party ticket renewed interest in his stature as the highest-ranking person of Native descent in the federal government.

In October, reporting on Ms. Harris’s preparations for a debate, the news site Indian Country Today noted that at least two Native Americans had sought the vice presidency in recent decades.

One was LaDonna Harris, a Comanche citizen, a candidate for the Citizens Party in 1980 with Barry Commoner; the other, Winona LaDuke, of White Earth Nation, was the Green Party nominee for vice president in 1996 and 2000, alongside Ralph Nader.

Laura Harris, LaDonna Harris’s daughter, said in an interview on Monday that she and her mother discovered more about Mr. Curtis while preparing for her campaign.

“You want people to know that we were politically active back in the 1800s, as well as today,” she said. “And we have served in government and were included in government.”

“But he is almost a fluke,” she added. “He did things that, today, we would think they were not very progressive. But that was his time.”

Ms. LaDuke said that while Native women had inspired her run, “I just think it is remarkable that a Native person was elected vice president. And a lot of people didn’t know that.”"
Barr’s Decision on Voter Fraud Inflames Existing Tensions With Anticorruption Prosecutors,"WASHINGTON — As the scandal over President Trump’s dealings with Ukraine unfolded in Washington last fall and prompted his impeachment, public corruption prosecutors in the Justice Department were stewing.

They had examined Mr. Trump’s actions and found no campaign finance violations, and were initially given the green light to pursue a potentially explosive inquiry into whether he had broken any other laws.

But Attorney General William P. Barr and other top officials held them back while Congress investigated the same matter during impeachment hearings. After the Senate acquitted the president, Mr. Barr in effect took the case away from the Public Integrity Section, sending all Ukraine-related inquiries to the U.S. attorney’s office in Brooklyn, according to six people familiar with the matter.

Compounding the prosecutors’ dissatisfaction was a stalled case around that time against a member of Mr. Trump’s cabinet, the former interior secretary Ryan Zinke. The deputy attorney general, Jeffrey A. Rosen, told the section’s lawyers that they needed a stronger case.

The details of their case are not public, making it difficult to evaluate its strength, but the response from Mr. Rosen exacerbated a sense inside the Public Integrity Section that top department officials would hinder investigations into Mr. Trump and his officials, according to several people familiar with the inquiry who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive investigations.

The boiling frustration was a critical moment in the long-running tensions between the Public Integrity Section and the Trump administration that began under Attorney General Jeff Sessions. They spilled into the open this week after Mr. Barr issued a memo authorizing prosecutors to investigate voter fraud claims before the results of the presidential race are certified, prompting the section’s lawyer who oversees voter fraud investigations, Richard Pilger, to step down from the post in protest.

“Having familiarized myself with the new policy and its ramifications,” Mr. Pilger wrote in an email to colleagues, “I must regretfully resign from my role as director of the Election Crimes Branch.”

The encounters were the latest example of Trump appointees at the top of the Justice Department overruling career prosecutors, drawing criticism that the administration was eroding the department’s typical separation from politics. Critics have also accused Mr. Barr of using the department to protect Mr. Trump and further his interests.

“All of these incidents coming to light show that Barr has been single-minded in his efforts to end the longstanding norm that the Justice Department be independent from politics,” said Vanita Gupta, a former department official under the Obama administration and now the head of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.

A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.

The Public Integrity Section was created as a post-Watergate safeguard against abuses of power. It has secured bribery and extortion convictions against politicians as part of the Abscam scandal of the 1970s and early 1980s and a corruption conviction against the lobbyist Jack Abramoff in 2006.

Its reputation suffered with the botched prosecution of Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, a case the department ultimately dropped.

The mistrust between lawyers in the Public Integrity Section and Trump officials began soon after Mr. Sessions became attorney general early in 2017.

He asked public corruption lawyers to brief him on high-profile investigations that they had declined to prosecute under the Obama administration and whether they could be reopened — including inquiries into Bill and Hillary Clinton’s foundation and an I.R.S. employee’s denial of tax-exempt status to conservative groups, according to two people with knowledge of the conversation.

Though public corruption staff members expressed views that Mr. Sessions’ questions were inappropriate, they were relieved when he did not push them to act after they explained why the cases had been closed, the people said.

Mr. Sessions said in a statement that he did ask for briefings on “certain high-profile cases” that been heavily scrutinized, defending his requests as “entirely proper.”

“Ensuring the professionalism and integrity of the department is the high duty of the attorney general,” Mr. Sessions said. “No member of the department and no part of their work is above supervision and review.”

Mr. Trump also took aim at the work of public corruption prosecutors in Washington and at U.S. attorney’s offices around the country, issuing pardons and commutations for people they had prosecuted, including Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, a staunch supporter of the president who had been convicted on contempt of court charges.

Mr. Barr’s confirmation hearing early last year did little to alleviate the prosecutors’ fears of continued interference. He testified that he had urged Mr. Sessions to end the department’s bribery and corruption prosecution of Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, whose first trial had ended in a hung jury. The department did withdraw the case under Mr. Sessions.

He said that the case was similar to some he had taken issue with during his first stint as attorney general in the first Bush administration and that “the prosecution was based on a fallacious theory” that could have long-term consequences for the department.

The anti-corruption lawyers’ fears about Mr. Barr were put to the test in August 2019 when the department learned that Mr. Trump had urged President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in a phone call to work with Mr. Barr to announce investigations that could help Mr. Trump politically.

Mr. Barr deterred two intelligence officials from forwarding a whistle-blower’s complaint about the phone call to Congress and said that the department would handle the criminal referral against Mr. Trump. The Public Integrity unit, which examines allegations of political corruption including campaign finance law violations, took on the matter.

Officials asked Mr. Pilger, who oversaw election-related crimes, and another lawyer to look into the matter, according to three people familiar with the inquiry. He and a colleague determined after about two weeks that Mr. Trump’s actions did not meet the threshold necessary to open an investigation into violations of campaign finance law, the subject of the referral.

“All relevant components of the department agreed with this legal conclusion, and the department has concluded the matter,” the department said in a statement in September 2019. Officials said at the time that the campaign finance determination did not preclude further investigatory work on any other potential issues.

Mr. Trump’s allies seized on that determination on the narrow question of campaign finance law to declare his innocence. But lawyers in the Public Integrity section had not examined any other potential violations, according to five people familiar with the section’s work.

It was not clear whether that office pursued an inquiry into Mr. Trump.

Their swelling frustration was a test for the new head of the section, Corey Amundson, who had joined from the department’s Office of Professional Responsibility that September.

At the start of his tenure, Mr. Amundson told staff members that he had prewritten a resignation letter that he would submit if he felt he was asked to act unethically. He soothed tempers in the Ukraine matter in part by agreeing that the reconstructed transcript of the call issued by the White House left open questions about whether Mr. Trump had violated other statutes, according to four people with knowledge of the discussions.

He said that more investigation was warranted and notified his boss, Brian A. Benczkowski, then the head of the criminal division, about the tensions over the Ukraine call. Mr. Benczkowski agreed that further inquiry would be appropriate, the people said.

But once Congress began its impeachment inquiry, top Justice Department officials decided that an investigation of Mr. Trump had been overtaken by the events of impeachment, according to two people briefed on the matter. Then any inquiry into the call was consolidated with other Ukraine matters at the beginning of this year under the Brooklyn U.S. attorney’s office. Under the Trump administration, the department has often moved politically fraught work to prosecutors far from Washington. Those investigations have rarely resulted in charges.

Around that time, the deputy attorney general, Jeffrey A. Rosen, also told prosecutors in the section that they could not proceed with charges against Mr. Zinke of making false statements to federal investigators, a case that stemmed from a referral from the Interior Department inspector general, according to three people familiar with the case.

Mr. Rosen expressed doubts about the strength of the case and sought a stronger prosecution. The prosecutors agreed to work further, and the inquiry has not been officially closed, according to people familiar with the matter.

The presidential race reignited the tensions in the weeks leading up the election. Mr. Barr told leaders in the criminal division, which oversees the Public Integrity Section, that he wanted to allow prosecutors to look into voter fraud allegations before the results of the presidential race had been certified, according to two people briefed on his conversations.

Such a move would not only contravene a longstanding department policy intended to keep the department from inadvertently affecting the results of the race, but it would also allow federal prosecutors to bypass the Public Integrity Section and Mr. Pilger, who had long been assigned to approve requests to conduct election fraud investigations that fell outside of the department’s guidelines.

Mr. Barr had a fundamental disagreement with Mr. Pilger over the original policy, which presumed that any overt investigative steps like questioning witnesses could harm an election. Mr. Barr had argued that fraud allegations should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, according to a department official.

The head of the criminal division, Brian Rabbitt, Mr. Barr’s former chief of staff, pushed back on the attorney general’s proposal. He and his staff considered the matter resolved when Election Day passed without Mr. Barr issuing any edict.

But the attorney general concluded it was ultimately his call, the department official said. He made it on Monday, saying that with all the votes cast it was proper for prosecutors to look into claims of voting irregularities.

The move stunned Mr. Rabbitt, Mr. Amundson, Mr. Pilger and others inside the criminal division, according four people who spoke with them. Mr. Pilger stepped down from his post within hours for a nonsupervisory role at the department.

Some colleagues expressed hope that his protest would send a message to the public and to other officials that they did not condone Mr. Barr’s memo. They told others that they feared he had set the stage for a U.S. attorney in a battleground state to announce an inquiry or take investigative steps that advance Mr. Trump’s debunked narrative that the election was stolen.

Black Voters Helped Deliver Biden a Presidential Victory. Now What?,"[Race affects our lives in countless ways. To read more stories on race from The New York Times, sign up here for our Race/Related newsletter.]

When President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. thanked Black voters in his victory speech on Saturday night for rescuing his campaign when it was at its lowest point and declared “you’ve always had my back, and I’ll have yours,” Kourtney Neloms did not cheer like the hundreds in attendance.

Instead, listening to Mr. Biden speak in Wilmington, Del., from her hometown, Detroit, she felt somewhat skeptical.

“OK, let’s see if he’s really being honest about this,” Ms. Neloms, 42, who is Black, recalled thinking. “My prayer is that it’s not just lip service.”

While Black voters across the country celebrated the election of Mr. Biden and his vice president, Senator Kamala Harris of California, many said in recent days that the administration would have to prove its sincerity when it came to addressing the country’s vast inequalities and systemic barriers.

“I am hopeful and willing to give Biden a chance but am not completely sold,” said Geary Woolfolk, 53, who is Black and lives in suburban Atlanta.

In this year’s election, Mr. Biden attracted about 87 percent of the Black vote. At the same time, Mr. Trump, despite being widely viewed as inflaming racial hatred, gained more Black voters than in 2016, especially among Black men, according to exit polls.

In two dozen interviews, some African-American voters echoed a longstanding political concern that they were underappreciated, particularly within the Democratic Party they have staunchly supported for decades. While Democrats always face high expectations to deliver for Black communities, the pressure on Mr. Biden, a compromise-first moderate, may be even greater because of the recent summer of protests over police brutality and systemic racism, the racial makeup of his electoral coalition and his own past.

In this year’s presidential bid, Mr. Biden’s political identity was shaped largely by the fact that he served as the vice president to Barack Obama, the country’s first African-American president. He leveraged that experience to garner Black support, and it was Black voters in South Carolina who rescued his campaign during the Democratic primary.

He also addressed an issue that might have affected Black support, acknowledging that parts of his signature legislation as a longtime Delaware senator, the 1994 crime bill, were a mistake. Much of his campaign pitch, too, centered on addressing racial disparities, with the coronavirus pandemic disproportionately harming Black and Latino communities, and incidents of police violence leading to one of the largest protest movements in the nation’s history.

Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris — the first Black woman on a successful presidential ticket — accumulated huge margins over Mr. Trump in Detroit, Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Atlanta, cities with large or majority Black populations that gave the president-elect a significant boost in tightly contested swing states.

Mr. Biden’s dramatic vow during his victory speech to return the favor for Black voters who so ardently supported him was an unusually explicit commitment to African-Americans from an incoming president.

“It does create a situation where there is more pressure to provide for the Black community,” said Isaiah Thomas, a city councilman in Philadelphia who is Black. “I don’t think that we can recreate this moment right here. So we have to get as much as we can for poor people and people of color.”

During the campaign, Mr. Biden released an extensive policy agenda that outlined his plan for Black America. It included proposals to invest in Black businesses and entrepreneurs, create opportunities for homeownership, narrow racial disparities in education and address a criminal justice system that disproportionately arrests, convicts and imprisons members of Black communities.

As he started his transition this week, Mr. Biden released a plan that included a section on racial equity. Activists with the Movement for Black Lives coalition said on Tuesday that they sent a letter to Mr. Biden asking to have a role in the transition, but that they have not heard back.

Not long after Mr. Biden’s speech on Saturday, Mr. Woolfolk, a centrist who described his vote not necessarily in favor of the new president but instead in opposition to Mr. Trump, wrote an open letter to Mr. Biden. He said the Democratic Party had not earned his vote — or his loyalty. “Politicians,” he wrote on Facebook, “my vote is open for bid — what will you do for me and my kind now that the election is over?”

The father of three grown sons, Mr. Woolfolk said he wanted police accountability without defunding departments and better preparation for Black students headed to college or trade school.

Jean Brooks Murphy counted herself among the more than 60 percent of Black voters in South Carolina who rescued Mr. Biden’s withering primary campaign.

“Biden definitely owes us an administration that works on equality,” said Ms. Brooks Murphy, 74, a retired retail buyer living in Charleston. She says access to health care is an important priority for her because she has many friends “who are afraid to go to the doctor or will not go because they can’t afford the treatment or the medicine.”

Part of the challenge for Mr. Biden will be to coalesce the broad and differing views that Black Americans hold on policy goals, ideas and strategies. Some see a drastic overhaul of systems — from policing to housing — as the path to equality, while others favor more moderate measures that can garner support across the political spectrum.

While young Black progressive activists champion slogans like “defund the police,” Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, one of the most powerful Black members of Congress, criticized the use of such phrases. He argued that they threatened to undermine support for racial justice movements and hurt Democrats in elections.

Banika Jones, 41, who works in food service for the Detroit Public Schools, said she wanted to see reparations for Black people, a public option for health insurance, a living wage for workers and the elimination of student loan debt.

“I want to see some actual, real socialist reform,” she said, emphasizing the political ideology that Republicans have used to demonize Democrats. “I said a dirty word and I meant it. I want us to move toward Denmark.”

Although she voted for Mr. Biden, Ms. Jones said she was not excited about him. Instead, she saw him as a continuation of past Democrats, who seem more inclined to try to placate voters in the middle, rather than push for real change for African-Americans and other marginalized groups.

“The Democrats always say that they’re going to do something,” she said. “They’re going to make health care better. They’re going to help us with education. They’re going to do something about poverty. But they have spines that are made out of ramen or something. They are completely unwilling to stand up and fight back.”

Jaymes Savage is far from being disillusioned. A 19-year-old sophomore at Rutgers University-Camden, he voted for the first time this year and is excited about what a Biden-Harris administration could mean for a Black man from Philadelphia like himself. He is especially hopeful that Ms. Harris — whose father immigrated from Jamaica and mother immigrated from India — would be able to relate to the continued struggles in his community.

“I’m kind of cautious,” he said, “but then again, I’m still hopeful because he specifically addressed us and he said that we were a key part of him winning the election. I feel as though that he really is going to try to help us more now.”

It was not enough for Black voters to wait on Mr. Biden to help their communities, some said. They needed to force the issue.

Jasmine M. Johnson, who spent a year helping to mobilize voters in Milwaukee, where turnout was similar to 2016, said she was ecstatic about Mr. Biden’s victory — and hopes his cabinet selections include Black women, “who once again delivered.” After that, she said, the president’s Black agenda should prioritize shrinking the wealth gap.

“This election cycle has been a refresher for some and a crash course for others in civics,” Ms. Johnson, 39, said. “We have to collectively understand the impact of elections in our lives and collectively come up with our ask of this new administration — and then hold them accountable.”"
‘A Black Eye’: Why Political Polling Missed the Mark. Again.,"Senator Susan Collins did not lead in a single publicly released poll during the final four months of her re-election campaign in Maine. But Ms. Collins, a Republican, won the election comfortably.

Senator Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, trailed in almost every poll conducted in his race. He won, too.

And most polls underestimated President Trump’s strength, in Iowa, Florida, Michigan, Texas, Wisconsin and elsewhere. Instead of winning a landslide, as the polls suggested, Joseph R. Biden Jr. beat Mr. Trump by less than two percentage points in the states that decided the election.

For the second straight presidential election, the polling industry missed the mark. The miss was not as blatant as in 2016, when polls suggested Mr. Trump would lose, nor was the miss as large as it appeared it might be on election night. Once all the votes are counted, the polls will have correctly pointed to the winner of the presidential campaign in 48 states — all but Florida and North Carolina — and correctly signaled that Mr. Biden would win.

But this year’s problems are still alarming, both to people inside the industry and to the millions of Americans who follow presidential polls with a passion once reserved for stock prices, sports scores and lottery numbers. The misses are especially vexing because pollsters spent much of the last four years trying to fix the central problem of 2016 — the underestimation of the Republican vote in multiple states — and they failed.

The Latest Polls Compared With Election Results

† These reflect Times estimates of the final vote margin once all votes are counted. * In Maine and Nebraska, two electoral votes are apportioned to the winner of the state popular vote, and the rest of the votes are given to the winner of the popular vote in each congressional district.

“This was a bad year for polling,” David Shor, a data scientist who advises Democratic campaigns, said. Douglas Rivers, the chief scientist of YouGov, a global polling firm, said, “We’re obviously going to have a black eye on this.”

The problems spanned the public polls that voters see and the private polls that campaigns use. Internal polls, conducted for both Democratic and Republican candidates, tended to make Republican candidates look weaker than they were.

In response, polling firms are asking whether they need to accelerate their shift to new research methods, such as surveying people by text message. And media organizations including The New York Times, which financially support and promote polls, are re-evaluating how they portray polls in future coverage. Some editors believe the best approach may be to give them less prominent coverage, despite intense interest from readers and despite the dominant role polls play in shaping campaign strategies.

This year’s misleading polls had real-world effects, for both political parties. The Trump campaign pulled back from campaigning in Michigan and Wisconsin, reducing visits and advertising, and lost both only narrowly. In Arizona, a Republican strategist who worked on Senator Martha McSally’s re-election campaign said that public polling showing her far behind “probably cost us $4 or $5 million” in donations. Ms. McSally lost to Mark Kelly by less than three percentage points.

Mr. Biden spent valuable time visiting Iowa and Ohio in the campaign’s final days, only to lose both soundly. Democrats also poured money into races that may never have been winnable, like the South Carolina Senate race, while paying less attention to some of their House incumbents who party leaders wrongly thought were safe. The party ended up losing seats.

“District-level polling has rarely led us — or the parties and groups investing in House races — so astray,” David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan publication that analyzes races, wrote last week.

The full explanation for the misses will not be knowable for months, until the election results are finalized, detailed poll data is released by survey firms, and public voter files — showing exactly who voted — are also released. Once this information is available, some of the immediate postelection criticism of polls may end up looking even worse than the polls themselves, academic researchers caution.

But the available facts already point to some likely conclusions:

People’s decreasing willingness to respond to polls — thanks partly to caller ID — has reduced average polling response to only 6 percent in recent years, according to the Pew Research Center, from above 50 percent in many polls during the 1980s. At today’s level, pollsters cannot easily construct a sample of respondents who resemble the population.

Some types of voters seem less willing to respond to polls than others, perhaps because they are less trusting of institutions, and these voters seem to lean Republican.

The polling industry tried to fix this problem after 2016, by ensuring that polling samples included enough white working-class voters in 2020. But that is not enough if response rates also vary within groups — for instance, if the white or Hispanic working-class voters who respond to polls have a different political profile than those who do not respond.

This year’s polls may have suffered from pandemic-related problems that will not repeat in the future, including a potential turnout decline among Democratic voters who feared contracting the coronavirus at a polling place.

A much-hyped theory that Trump supporters lie to pollsters appears to be wrong or insignificant. Polls did not underestimate his support more in liberal areas, where supporting Mr. Trump can be less socially acceptable, than in conservative areas.

In what may be the most complex pattern, polls underestimated the support of multiple Senate Republican candidates even more than Mr. Trump. This means the polls missed a disproportionate number of Americans who voted for both Mr. Biden and a Republican Senate candidate — and that the problems do not simply involve Mr. Trump’s base.

Defenders of the polling industry point out that the final national error may not be very different from the historical average — and that polls can never be perfect, given the difficulty of capturing the mood of a large, diverse country. National polling averages showed Mr. Biden with a lead of about eight percentage points. Once all the votes are counted, he appears likely to win the popular vote by about four or five percentage points.

“The problem is,” Patrick Murray, the director of polling at Monmouth University said, “even if the polls end up being significantly closer to the final results when it’s counted, most people remember how they felt the morning after.”

Regardless, there are reasons for concern: Polling now seems to suffer from some systemic problems, which create a misleading picture of the country’s politics.

This problem has sprung up at the same time that a deeply polarized country has become more intensely interested in politics than it once was. The share of eligible voters who turned out this year may have reached the highest level since 1900. Book sales about politics have soared, as have ratings for television news and subscriptions to publications that cover politics. Many people crave polls, which can have an addictive quality, especially during an election that both parties described as an existential battle for America’s future.

Politics has become a high-stakes spectator sport at the same time that the country’s ability to understand it has weakened.

Pollsters have been grappling with some of the same challenges since the creation of the industry in the early 20th century.

One of the first polls to receive widespread attention came from The Literary Digest, a magazine, and it was published days before the 1916 presidential election. The magazine asked readers in 3,000 communities to mail in sample ballots and then reported that President Woodrow Wilson was in a stronger position than his Republican opponent, Charles Evans Hughes.

Wilson won the election, and The Literary Digest poll became a national phenomenon, correctly pointing to the winners from 1920 through 1932. In 1936, though, the poll showed that Alf Landon, the Republican nominee, would easily defeat Franklin D. Roosevelt. Instead, Roosevelt won in a landslide, and the error changed the industry.

Although Literary Digest’s sample of 2.4 million respondents was enormous, it was not representative. The magazine’s circulation skewed toward affluent Americans, who were more hostile to Roosevelt and the New Deal than most voters. A less prominent pollster that year, George Gallup, had surveyed many fewer people — about 50,000 — but he had been careful to ensure they matched the country’s demographic mix. Mr. Gallup correctly predicted a Roosevelt win.

Mr. Gallup’s methods shaped the industry, which today consists of dozens of organizations, with a wide range in quality. Typically, a poll surveys hundreds or a few thousand people and then extrapolates their answers to represent the broader population. If a poll cannot reach enough people in a certain demographic group — say, white Catholics or older Black men — it counts those it does reach in the group more heavily.

Still, the Gallup methods were not perfect, for some of the same reasons that polls have struggled recently. Within some demographic groups, Gallup turned out to be interviewing more Republican voters than Democratic ones, and it overestimated the Republican vote share in 1936, 1940 and 1944.

In retrospect, a front-page article in The New York Times on the Sunday before the 1936 election is a telling case study. Written by Arthur Krock, the newspaper’s Washington bureau chief, the article asked more than 200 experts to forecast the result. The article’s headline read: “Experts Predict Roosevelt Victory With Probably 406 Electoral Votes.” In the House and Senate, Republicans would likely make gains, the experts said.

That forecast was roughly consistent with the Gallup poll — and it ended up being badly off. Roosevelt won 523 electoral votes, and Democrats made big gains in Congress. But neither the Gallup error nor the misleading Times survey attracted much attention, because they had still forecast a Roosevelt victory.

“This was merely due to luck,” Dennis DeTurck, a mathematician at the University of Pennsylvania, has pointed out. “The spread between the candidates was large enough to cover the error.”

In 1948, the pollsters’ luck ran out. They continued to overestimate the Republican vote share, reporting throughout the campaign that President Harry Truman trailed his Republican opponent, Thomas Dewey. This time, the election was close enough that the polls pointed to the wrong winner, contributing to perhaps the most famous error in modern journalism, The Chicago Tribune’s banner headline “Dewey Defeats Truman.”

That error led to a new overhaul of polling. Pollsters redoubled their efforts to build samples that were representative of the country. They were not perfect: Presidential polls in the 1950s and 60s missed by about four percentage points on average, similar to this year’s miss, according to the website FiveThirtyEight.

“Polling has always been challenging,” Nate Silver, FiveThirtyEight’s editor in chief, said.

But polls still tended to point correctly to the winner of the presidential race in those years, partly because Americans were so willing to respond to polls.

People tended to answer their telephone when it rang. They also tended to trust major institutions, like the government, the media and higher education. And they did not have a constant source of entertainment in their pocket — a smartphone — that an extended telephone survey kept them from using, as Mr. Shor, the data scientist, said.

“Decades ago, most people would be happy to answer the door to a stranger or answer the phone to a stranger,” Courtney Kennedy, the director of survey research at Pew, said, “and those days are long gone.”

When response rates began falling in the 1980s and 1990s, many people in the polling industry worried that they were facing a crisis: How could they accurately measure Americans’ opinions if many refused to respond to surveys?

But no crisis materialized. If anything, surveys became somewhat more accurate, as pollsters refined their methods. Once researchers analyzed the data, they landed on an explanation for why low response rates were manageable: “Whether somebody was going to participate in a survey was not really related the things surveys tended to measure,” Ms. Kennedy, of Pew, said.

Some groups, like college graduates and politically engaged people, were more willing to respond to polls. But the differences did not break down along partisan lines. Similar numbers of Democratic and Republican voters were declining to answer questions, which allowed the polls to be accurate.

Then came the election of 2016.

Nearly every poll showed Hillary Clinton to be leading Mr. Trump in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The leads were big enough that her campaign paid relatively little attention to those states. But she lost all three narrowly, giving Mr. Trump a stunning victory.

Afterward, pollsters dug into their data, comparing it to precinct-by-precinct election results and to voter files, which show who voted but not how they voted. In early 2017, the leading industry group, the American Association of Public Opinion Research, or AAPOR, released its conclusions.

One factor was largely unsolvable: Late-deciding voters, accurately identified as undecided in polls, broke strongly for Mr. Trump. Many may have been swayed by James Comey, the F.B.I. director, who nine days before the election sent a letter to Congress announcing that he was again looking into Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state.

A second factor was more damning for pollsters. Many had not ensured that their samples included enough people without college degrees, especially among white voters.

In the late 20th century and early 2000s, missing some of these voters had not been a big problem, because white college graduates and white non-graduates voted similarly. In 2016, these voters shifted to Mr. Trump, and the polls had failed to capture it.

The report by AAPOR offered an optimistic conclusion. The national polls had been close to correct, overestimating Mrs. Clinton’s vote share by only about one percentage point. That was well within the range of historical polling errors. And there were obvious steps the industry could take to improve in the future, by including more working-class voters or weighting the ones who responded more heavily.

Perhaps most important, the polling association argued, the 2016 experience did not suggest a systematic problem in which polls favored one party. In some years, like 2012, polls slightly underestimated the Democratic share, and in other years, like 2016, they slightly underestimated the Republican share. The report said the direction of those misses was “essentially random.”

The midterm elections of the following year, 2018, initially seemed to support this conclusion. The polls correctly suggested that Democrats would sweep to victory in the House, while Republicans would retain the Senate. State polls were off by an average of about four percentage points, which was historically normal.

The underlying details contained some reasons for concern, though. While polls in some liberal states, like California and Massachusetts, had underestimated the Democrats’ vote share in 2018, polls in several swing states and conservative states, including Florida, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania, again underestimated the Republican share.

For the second time since Mr. Trump’s entry in politics, the polls had somehow failed to reach enough Republican voters in the swing states that decide modern presidential elections. A third election — his re-election campaign — was looming in 2020, and it was one that millions of Americans, both his supporters and critics, would be following passionately.

By the final weeks of this year’s campaign, the polls seemed to be telling a clear story: Mr. Biden had led Mr. Trump by a significant margin for the entire race, and the lead had widened since the summer. Some combination of the coronavirus, Mr. Trump’s reaction to police brutality and his erratic behavior at the first debate had put Mr. Biden within reach of the most lopsided presidential win since Ronald Reagan’s in 1984.

In the campaign’s final 10 days, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed Mr. Biden up by 10 percentage points nationwide, as did a YouGov poll. Fox News put the lead at eight points, and CNN at 12. Other polls also showed the lead to be at least eight points.

In Wisconsin, which Mr. Trump had won narrowly in 2016, a YouGov poll found Mr. Biden up by nine percentage points. A New York Times/Siena College poll showed the lead was 11 points, while Morning Consult said 13 points. A Washington Post/ABC News poll reported the lead was 17 points. In congressional races, the Cook Political Report called the Democrats clear favorites to retake the Senate and gain seats in the House.

That, of course, did not happen. Mr. Biden won Wisconsin by less than one percentage point, while Republicans fared much better in congressional races than polls had suggested.

Even Republican-aligned firms struggled. The Trafalgar Group, for example, was closer than other pollsters in some states. But Trafalgar fared worse than the competition in other states, suggesting that Mr. Trump was ahead in Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Because polling challenges evidently varied by region, reporting more Republican-friendly results everywhere did not solve the problem.

Since Election Day, some campaign operatives have claimed that their private polls were more accurate than the public ones. They have offered no proof, however, and the behavior of campaigns, including both Mr. Biden’s and Mr. Trump’s, suggests private polls were also inaccurate.

What went wrong? There are almost certainly multiple causes, pollsters and political scientists say. One possibility is that the pandemic may have led to an unexpected falloff in Election Day voting among Democrats, given that the party emphasized mail voting. Another is that Democratic voters, energized by the Trump presidency and bored during the pandemic, became newly excited to respond to polls.

But the most likely explanation remains an unwillingness among some Republican voters to answer surveys. This problem may have become more acute during Mr. Trump’s presidency, because he frequently told his supporters not to trust the media.

“I think when all the votes are counted, what we are going to see is a far smaller polling error, potentially even minimal, in many of the states where the presidential was competitive,” Jefrey Pollock, a Democratic pollster and president of the Global Strategy Group, said. But he acknowledged that some polls were off and added, “As professionals, we have to question whether a segment of the electorate has opted out of talking to us.”

B.J. Martino, a partner at the Tarrance Group, which works for Republicans, said, “If there is an underlying issue, it’s not getting those folks on the phone to begin with.” Paul Maslin, a Democratic pollster, said: “They don’t trust the news media. They don’t trust elites. They don’t trust scientists. They don’t trust academics. They don’t trust experts.”

These voters do not fit any one demographic group, which is part of why they are so difficult to reach. Instead, they appear to be a distinct group of voters within some groups. Imagine if, say, the independent, Hispanic, middle-aged, working-class women who were willing to answer a survey also happened to lean more Democratic than the same demographic profile of voters who were unwilling. And then imagine that the pattern holds only in certain states.

Even if pollsters constructed samples with the right mix of groups — by race, gender, age, income, education, religion and party registration — they might not capture the electorate’s mood. Those demographic factors, Mr. Shor said, “are not enough to predict partisanship anymore.”

In some ways, the problem is new. It is a reflection of modern technology, political polarization and more. In other ways, though, the problem has existed since the 1930s, when polls also undercounted segments of the working-class vote.

One difference is that those undercounted voters leaned Democratic at the time, which led polls to understate the strength of Roosevelt and Truman. The partisan effect has since flipped, with the white working class now backing Republicans, but the underlying dynamic has remained the same.

Pollsters managed to fix the problem after their “Dewey Defeats Truman” reckoning. The question is how they can do it again now, when survey response rates have fallen well below 10 percent.

Perhaps the one pollster who has emerged from the last few years with the best reputation is J. Ann Selzer, who runs a firm in West Des Moines, Iowa, and who conducts polls with The Des Moines Register.

This year, while other polls were showing a tossup in both Iowa’s Senate and presidential races, Selzer & Co. reported on the campaign’s final weekend that Mr. Trump held a seven-point lead and Senator Joni Ernst, the Republican incumbent, held a four-point lead.

They both went on to win by somewhat more, which suggests that Ms. Selzer is not immune from the current problems. But in both 2016 and 2020, her final polls correctly showed that Iowa had changed from a tossup state to a largely Republican one.

One of her methods, she said in an interview, is keeping her surveys short, because there are differences between voters who are willing to talk at length to a pollster and those who are not. Most of her surveys last less than 15 minutes. In her final survey before an election, she tries to keep the interviews under eight minutes.

“There’s a self-selection in people’s willingness to talk to polls,” she said. She recalled conducting a 45-minute-long survey for a private client years ago about Transcendental Meditation. “Our finding was that about half the people we talked to had an experience with Transcendental Meditation,” she said. “Do you think that’s true?”

The polling industry group, AAPOR, had announced months before the election that it would conduct a post-mortem analysis for 2020. This analysis — and others, done by individual pollsters — will probably shape the specific measure that pollsters take.

Regardless, there is unlikely to be any single step that fixes the polls’ recent anti-Republican lean. Instead, pollsters are likely to try a mix of many small measures, like Ms. Selzer’s short interviews.

One option is to create new screening questions about whether respondents trust other people and major institutions — and then weight less trustful respondents more heavily in a poll’s final results. Pew, in recent years, has asked questions about whether people spend time volunteering, as one measure of trust.

Another is to expand the use of text messages and other nonverbal communication, like Facebook messages, in surveying people. “We’re going to see more diversity in polling methodologies,” said Kevin Collins, the co-founder of Survey160, which collects data through text messaging.

Some pollsters also wonder whether the problems may recede when Mr. Trump is not on the ballot. But he seems unlikely to be the only cause of errant polling, given how badly many congressional surveys missed the mark this year. In Arizona, Georgia, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina and South Carolina, the final publicly released Senate polls fell short by more on average than the final presidential polls.

A separate set of changes may involve how the media present polling and whether publications spend as much money on it in the future. “The media that sponsor polls should demand better results because their reputations are on the line,” James A. Baker III, the former secretary of state, wrote in The Wall Street Journal this week.

Among other questions, editors are grappling with the best way to convey the inherent uncertainty in polls.

Mr. Silver, then an independent blogger, created a breakthrough in 2008 when he began writing about every available poll, focusing on the swing states and talking about the probability of one candidate beating another. Before that, most publications had focused on national polls and largely ignored those done by competing publications.

The New York Times published Mr. Silver’s blog, FiveThirtyEight, from 2010 through 2013, and it is now part of ABC News. Other publications have since taken a similar approach, creating their own probabilistic models.

Mr. Silver and others have tried to emphasize the uncertainty in polls, by giving both candidates in a race a percentage that reflects their likelihood of winning. But many people seem to struggle to make sense of these probabilities in a one-time event like an election. They see that a candidate has a 71 percent chance of winning, as FiveThirtyEight gave Mrs. Clinton in 2016, and incorrectly think it is akin to a guarantee.

This year, FiveThirtyEight used a dot to portray each percentage-point possibility, stressing that either candidate could win.

The Times, which in 2016 had given Mrs. Clinton an 85 percent chance of winning, did not create a probabilistic model this year. It instead published a table that included both polling averages and a column showing the likely result if each state’s polls were as wrong as they had been in 2016. That column looks better in hindsight than the polling averages.

Virtually nobody thinks polling is going away. It is too important in a democracy, Mr. Collins, of Survey160, said. It guides campaign strategies and politicians’ policy choices. And there is no alternative method of election analysis with anywhere near as good a track record as polling’s imperfect record.

The only short-term solution, some people believe, is for pollsters and the media to emphasize — and for Americans to recognize — that polling can be misleading. Even an aggregate picture, from dozens of polls, can be meaningfully off, especially in an intensely divided political era.

“There’s something in U.S. culture that has developed a fetish with quantitative forecasting,” Dahlia Scheindlin, a Tel Aviv-based pollster who has worked in 15 countries, said.

If nothing else, the polling of the last four years may have given Americans a better understanding that they should not take polls literally. “The narrative around polling has to change,” Cornell Belcher, a Democratic pollster, said, “because it’s misinforming and it’s setting polling up to fail.”

Biden Speaks to European Allies as Strongmen Stay Silent on U.S. Vote,"WASHINGTON — President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. fielded congratulatory calls from European leaders on Tuesday, even as some of President Trump’s authoritarian allies maintained a conspicuous silence about the election that could foreshadow coming tensions with the Biden administration.

Mr. Biden spoke on Tuesday with President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain and Prime Minister Micheal Martin of Ireland. He offered the leaders messages of support and cooperation, his transition team said in a statement, including expressing to Mr. Macron “his interest in reinvigorating bilateral and trans-Atlantic ties, including through NATO” and the European Union — institutions Mr. Trump has repeatedly derided.

The conversations offered a clear reaffirmation of U.S.-European ties and a signal of a broader return to normalcy in foreign relations ahead. Coupled with the conspicuous silence of more authoritarian leaders, they also provided early hints of a reordering of American allies and antagonists back to their state before Mr. Trump’s disruptive foreign policy sank trans-Atlantic relations to their lowest point since World War II.

Among those who have remained silent are President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil and President Xi Jinping of China. After days of quiet, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, finally congratulated Mr. Biden on Tuesday, according to Turkish state media, days after most other allies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had already done so. None of those authoritarian leaders — with the possible exception of Mr. Xi, whose calculations are unclear — welcome the prospect of a Biden presidency after years of mostly friendly relations with Mr. Trump.

Mr. Biden’s conversations with European leaders — whose contents were described by the Biden transition team in greater detail than is typical of the Trump White House — were also a stark contrast to the first days after the 2016 election, when Mr. Trump seemed to field visits and calls in haphazard fashion. Japan’s prime minister at the time, Shinzo Abe, quickly flew to Trump Tower in mid-November to become the first foreign leader to meet Mr. Trump, a first for a Japanese leader, while Mr. Trump took a call from the president of Taiwan in what was a startling breach of diplomatic protocol that infuriated Beijing.

“He’s doing it in the right order, unlike Trump when he took office,” said Evelyn N. Farkas, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia in the Obama administration. “Protocol is back.”

Jeremy Shapiro, a former Obama State Department official now with the European Council on Foreign Relations, said that under past circumstances, there would be nothing remarkable about a president-elect speaking to several European allies. But given four years of tensions with Mr. Trump, the calls hold unusual meaning.

“It’s part of his overall approach to saying, ‘We’re back, and we’re going to start obeying diplomatic norms, we’re going to start treating allies better than dictators,’” Mr. Shapiro said.

Whether by intention or not, the European leaders also served to further legitimize Mr. Biden’s victory and discredit Mr. Trump’s continued false claim to be the winner.

“They’ve all come out and congratulated him, and in a sense weighed in on what is a domestic political struggle, which is a risky thing for them to do, after all,” Mr. Shapiro said. “Of course everybody thinks Joe Biden will be president. But they’re not 100 percent sure.”

Ms. Merkel is clearly delighted by Mr. Biden’s victory, after four years of Mr. Trump’s complaints that Germany was taking advantage of the United States economically and militarily.

After Mr. Trump won the presidency in 2016, Ms. Merkel issued a statement pointedly reminding him that the United States and Germany were “connected by values of democracy, freedom and respect for the law and the dignity of man.” By contrast, she said she welcomed Mr. Biden’s victory “very warmly” with a statement that notably dismissed any doubt about the outcome, declaring: “The American people have made their decision.”

Mr. Johnson, while in some ways a populist fellow traveler of Mr. Trump’s, was also notably enthusiastic in a tweet posted after his Tuesday talk with the president-elect, saying he looked forward to working with the incoming president on climate change, democracy promotion and, echoing a Biden campaign slogan, “building back better” from the coronavirus pandemic.

According to the Biden transition team’s descriptions of the calls, Mr. Biden and the Europeans also discussed human rights, the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, and Iran’s nuclear program — all areas in which they largely disagree with Mr. Trump’s policies.

The descriptions also said Mr. Biden and Mr. Johnson spoke about “strengthening democracy,” a core foreign policy theme of Mr. Biden’s campaign, in which he pledged to defend and restore democratic values around the world under assault from many of the same leaders who have been silent or slow to acknowledge his victory.

Those notably include Mr. Putin, whose spokesman said on Sunday that the Kremlin would “wait for an official announcement” before making any statement. China’s Foreign Ministry has used similar language.

Dr. Farkas said that any congratulations for Mr. Biden’s victory by Mr. Putin might be particularly painful for Mr. Trump, who has spent years courting the Russian leader’s favor and boasting about their relationship. “I do think that if Putin were to acknowledge reality, it would become more difficult for Trump to ignore reality,” she said.

Several Middle Eastern autocrats who benefited from friendly relations with Mr. Trump also congratulated Mr. Biden shortly after he was declared the election winner by major American news organizations, reflecting his growing lead in several state vote counts. They include President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, Prince Mohammed bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who formed a close alliance with Mr. Trump, has also congratulated Mr. Biden.

Until Tuesday, another notable holdout had been Mr. Erdogan, who cultivated a bond with Mr. Trump that muted America’s response to several Turkish actions that angered other Atlantic alliance members, like Turkey’s invasion of northeastern Syria in October 2019 and its purchase of an advanced Russian-made missile system.

“Erdogan made all his bets on a Trump victory and is now devastated to see that Biden has won,” said Aykan Erdemir, a former member of Turkey’s Parliament now with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, explaining the Turkish leader’s foot-dragging. “The Turkish president is distraught that he will no longer enjoy personal rapport with his U.S. counterpart, which has granted him impunity on myriad issues.”

Thomas Wright, the director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution, saw a simple message emerging from the past several days.

“The free world is ready to move on,” he said. “The autocrats are mourning one of their own.”"
The Surging Coronavirus Finds a Federal Leadership Vacuum,"WASHINGTON — When senior Food and Drug Administration officials held their morning call one day this week, they received a sobering warning from the agency’s chief, Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, who had just gotten off the phone with the White House: Block out “all the craziness” afoot and stay focused on fighting the pandemic, he said.

There are plenty of distractions. President Trump is pushing to overturn the results of the election and his only public statements about the coronavirus in the last few days were to make clear his pique that good news about a vaccine had not come until after Election Day — even as the number of new daily infections on Wednesday topped 140,000, average daily deaths shot past the 1,000 mark, and Covid-19 hospitalizations hit a record high of 65,368.

Vice President Mike Pence canceled a vacation at the last minute as the virus numbers grew worse, but the White House coronavirus task force that he leads has been all but publicly silent. Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff who is infected with the virus, declared last month, “We are not going to control the pandemic,” and said the focus should instead be on the longer-term goals of developing vaccines and treatments.

Since then, the White House political director, Brian Jack, and two other White House aides have become the latest administration officials to test positive for the virus, people familiar with the diagnosis said on Wednesday.

The pandemic caught the nation flat-footed in March, but epidemiologists have been warning for months of a fall and winter wave as people are driven indoors, schools resume in-person classes and Americans grow tired of months of precautions. Yet shortages of personal protective equipment are back, especially among rural hospitals, nursing homes and private medical practices that lack access to the supply networks that serve larger hospital chains.

The Strategic National Stockpile, the nation’s emergency reserve, has only 115 million N95 masks, far short of the 300 million the administration had hoped to amass by winter, Rear Adm. John Polowczyk, who retired on Monday as the national supply chain commander, said in a recent interview, though he added that the government is continuing to expand its supplies of protective gear.

Dr. Shikha Gupta, the executive director of Get Us PPE, a volunteer effort that matches available supplies to health care providers, said 70 percent of those requesting help from the organization last month reported being completely out of some gear, especially masks, gloves and disinfecting wipes.

“Health care workers are exhausted and frustrated, and it’s really hard to believe that on Nov. 10, it feels very much like the middle of March all over again,” she said.

Governors are once again competing with one another and big hospital chains for scarce gear. Nursing homes are grappling with staff shortages, which have left hospitals unable to discharge patients to their care. In Wisconsin, the situation is so severe that health officials are mulling a plan to train family members of nursing home residents to fill in at facilities that lack enough workers.

“We’re throwing every idea that we can conceivably think of to the state, but we really need bold action from the federal government,” said John Sauer, the president of LeadingAge Wisconsin, an association that represents nonprofit nursing homes and long-term care facilities. “We can’t muddle through this on our own.”

The United States is on somewhat better footing now than in the earliest days of the pandemic. States and hospitals have their own stockpiles, and Admiral Polowczyk said the federal government had met its goal of acquiring 153,000 ventilators.

But as the country enters what may be the most intense stage of the pandemic yet, the Trump administration remains largely disengaged. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. is trying to assume a leadership mantle, with the appointment of a coronavirus advisory board and a call for all Americans to wear masks, but until his inauguration on Jan. 20, he lacks the authority to mobilize a federal response.

“With 1,000 deaths per day, it’s like two jumbo jets dropping from the sky,” said Dr. Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease specialist at Emory University. “If every day, two jumbo jets would drop from the sky and kill everybody, don’t you think that everybody would be in a panic?”

A White House spokesman, Brian Morgenstern, said Mr. Trump and his administration “remain focused on saving lives,” citing their efforts to produce a vaccine and therapeutics. He added that the task force “is in constant contact with state and local officials” to provide help when needed.

But Mr. Trump is at war with his own health officials. He was furious after the drug maker Pfizer announced Monday that early clinical trial data suggested its coronavirus vaccine was more than 90 percent effective. In a conversation with Dr. Hahn, a senior administration official said, the president accused the company and the F.D.A. of conspiring to delay news that could have bolstered his chances of re-election.

Aides said the president believed that Pfizer could have announced the success of its clinical trial before Nov. 3 but deliberately chose to hold up the news, possibly not to taint the company’s vaccine as a last-minute effort to save Mr. Trump’s re-election bid. White House aides were particularly incensed that Mr. Biden publicly said his public health advisers knew of Pfizer’s results on Sunday, before aides said the news had reached the White House.

With distribution of a coronavirus vaccine beginning in the U.S., here are answers to some questions you may be wondering about:

Beyond Mr. Trump’s Twitter feed, the federal bully pulpit — an essential component of an effective infectious disease response — has largely gone silent. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, said in an interview on Tuesday that the vaccine would be “a game changer” over time.

But a vaccine is not an immediate panacea, and until doses become widely available — likely in mid-2021 — the nation is in a “difficult situation,” he said, that calls for Americans to wear masks and social distance, and to avoid crowded settings, particularly indoors.

“My message to the American public is: Hang on, help is coming, a vaccine is on its way, we need to all pull together,” Dr. Fauci said.

Washington’s leadership void is raising anxiety in states and cities.

In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Wednesday that private indoor gatherings statewide would be limited to 10 people and that gyms, bars and restaurants must close each night at 10.

In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, announced a series of new measures, including one that escalated the state’s mask order by threatening to temporarily shut down retailers that fail to comply and another that demanded that private celebrants at events like weddings wear masks and refrain from dancing and games. He said the state would consider new restrictions on bars and restaurants a week from Thursday.

“Wear a mask,” he implored on Wednesday in an address to the state. “Wear a mask, so that your friends, neighbors and family members might live.”

In North Dakota, Gov. Doug Burgum said this week that the state’s hospitals were full and that even health workers who test positive for the virus but do not display symptoms would be allowed to work in wards dedicated to coronavirus patients.

Local officials say they feel as if they are struggling alone. New weekly cases among nursing home residents jumped fourfold from the end of May to late October, and deaths have more than doubled in 20 states, according to R. Tamara Konetzka and Rebecca J. Gorges, researchers at the University of Chicago who analyzed data from the C.D.C.

“The depressing message is that nothing much has changed since the spring,” Professor Konetzka said.

Even many large hospital chains, which say they have adequate supplies of medical gear, continue to operate in crisis mode. That often means requiring employees to repeatedly reuse respirator masks that are meant to be discarded after each use.

Deborah Burger, a president of National Nurses United, the largest organization of registered nurses, said the lack of clear guidance from the C.D.C. had allowed hospitals to create their own standards for reusing disposable protective gear, which she said put hospital workers and patients at increased risk of infection.

“We’re 11 months into the pandemic, and the administration is still not adequately addressing the safety of health care workers and the safety of our communities,” she said.

The White House has fixated on Operation Warp Speed, the administration’s crash vaccine and therapy development program, while its coronavirus task force has whittled down to rote weekly gatherings in the Situation Room. But far from celebrating the Pfizer news on Monday, the administration initiated a round of recriminations.

In a Twitter message on Monday, Mr. Trump said that Pfizer deliberately postponed announcing its good news, and that the F.D.A. had supported that delay.

In a meeting of the coronavirus task force on Monday afternoon, the health secretary, Alex M. Azar II, confronted Dr. Hahn about the Pfizer announcement and said the F.D.A.’s coordination with Pfizer and its exhaustive vaccine guidelines had delayed the news of the breakthrough, according to senior administration officials who witnessed the exchange.

He questioned Dr. Hahn’s timeline for an emergency authorization of Pfizer’s vaccine.

The president’s allies suspected that Pfizer could have obtained results from its trial earlier, but chose not to. Pfizer had in fact initially planned to request seeing the results from an independent safety monitoring board once 32 of its clinical trial participants who had received either the vaccine or a placebo had come down with Covid-19. That would have been the company’s first barometer of its effectiveness.

But weeks ago, Pfizer officials said, F.D.A. regulators had advised that they would be unlikely to issue an emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s vaccine based on just 32 cases in a trial with nearly 44,000 people.

Pfizer decided to wait for more cases. By last weekend, 94 subjects had tested positive for Covid-19, a sample seemingly more than sufficient to satisfy the F.D.A. The company said an early analysis showed the vaccine was more than 90 percent effective.

Pfizer has said it expects to apply for emergency use authorization by late November, and experts expect the F.D.A. to decide as early as mid-December. But Pfizer has said it has manufactured only a few million doses, and experts are hoping the government can step in to help speed up manufacturing. A second vaccine maker, Moderna, could soon seek F.D.A.’s review of its clinical trial results.

On Monday, the F.D.A. granted emergency authorization to Eli Lilly for an antibody treatment similar to a therapy given to Mr. Trump shortly after he contracted the coronavirus. The company has a limited number of doses and the treatment is only authorized for newly infected patients who have not been hospitalized.

Some in the agency took Dr. Hahn’s Tuesday warning to his senior staff members about “craziness” afoot as a sign that the president might fire him. Others said the commissioner was merely acknowledging the obvious: The postelection period will be rocky.

How Trump’s Refusal to Concede Affects Biden’s National Security Transition,"President Trump’s refusal to concede the election to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has already affected Mr. Biden’s transition, particularly on national security issues.

Mr. Biden has yet to receive a presidential daily briefing, and it was unclear whether his team would have access to classified information, the most important pipeline for them to learn about the threats facing the United States.

Like previous presidents-elect, Mr. Biden is receiving Secret Service protection, and a no-fly zone has been established over his home in Delaware. But if Mr. Trump’s administration continues its refusal to recognize Mr. Biden as the winner, it could complicate his security until his inauguration.

Here are some of the issues at play:

Mr. Trump can prevent Mr. Biden and his aides from receiving the presidential daily briefing, the compendium of the government’s latest secrets and best intelligence insights, for the entire transition. No law states that Mr. Biden must receive it, though under previous administrations dating to at least 1968, presidents have authorized their elected successors to be given the briefing after clinching victory.

Previous presidents considered it good governance, said David Priess, a former C.I.A. officer and the author of “The President’s Book of Secrets,” about the daily brief.

“As with so many norms and traditions, it is hard to say it will happen with this president,” Mr. Priess said.

Mr. Trump’s indifference to norms is a central theme of his presidency, making him unlikely to begin following them now that he has lost the election.

A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on why Mr. Trump had not authorized Mr. Biden to receive the briefing. A Biden campaign spokesman also did not respond to a request for comment on whether the president-elect should already be receiving the briefing.

In the aftermath of the contested 2000 election, while votes in Florida were being recounted, President Bill Clinton authorized George W. Bush to receive the President’s Daily Brief. As vice president, Al Gore already had access to the intelligence.

Along with the presidential daily briefing, transition team officials need to have access to classified information at intelligence agencies, like the C.I.A., to make staffing decisions and begin planning for the administration.

On this front, Mr. Trump can make it much more difficult for the Biden team to gain access to those materials. Under law, the Trump administration must formally recognize Mr. Biden as the president-elect to share classified information with his team. That decision is typically made by the head of the General Services Administration, a little-known government agency that oversees the transition. The head of that agency, Emily W. Murphy, is a Trump political appointee who so far has declined to designate Mr. Biden as the president-elect. As long as the G.S.A. refuses to recognize Mr. Biden, the team cannot legally view the materials.

Former vice presidents like Mr. Biden do not receive full-time Secret Service protection, but Mr. Biden has had a protection detail since earlier this year. The Secret Service also extended the no-fly zone over Mr. Biden’s home to cover an entertainment complex in downtown Wilmington, Del., where he addressed the nation on Saturday night.

But if the Trump administration — through the G.S.A. — continues to not recognize Mr. Biden as the president-elect, it is likely to stymie the typical transition that occurs between Mr. Biden’s temporary security detail and the one specifically devised to protect presidents, known as the Presidential Protection Division. Under previous administrations, the Secret Service has had the two teams begin working together during the transition with the incoming president’s detail becoming increasingly made up of Presidential Protection Division agents and officers as Inauguration Day approached. Such a handoff requires significant resources and changes in personnel work hours, and former agency officials say the Secret Service is highly unlikely to begin that transition unless the G.S.A. has authorized it.

Arkansas Police Chief Resigns After Calling for Democrats to Be Executed,"As the results of the presidential election unfolded last week and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. took the lead in the Electoral College, the police chief of Marshall, Ark., a town of roughly 1,350 people north of Little Rock, shared his feeling of rage online.

“Will you and several hundred more go with me to D.C. and fight our way into the Congress and arrest every Democrat who has participated in this coup?” Chief Lang Holland posted Friday on Parler, a right-wing messaging site. “We may have to shoot and kill many of the Communist B.L.M. and ANTIFA Democrat foot soldiers to accomplish this!!!”

“Death to all Marxist Democrats. Take no prisoners leave no survivors!!” Chief Holland added.

Roughly a day later, after an NBC affiliate in Little Rock reported on his posts, Chief Holland was out of a job. His Parler account, which says he previously worked as a trainer in Iraq and Afghanistan, has since been made private but has not been deleted.

The police chief’s undoing came at breakneck speed.

Quinn Foster, a 26-year-old Arkansan who runs the Ozarks Coalition, an anti-racist watch group, and shared screen shots of Mr. Holland’s Parler posts with The New York Times, said he was alerted to the posts at 7 a.m. on Saturday. An hour later he had taken screen shots of Mr. Holland’s online statements on Parler that were then shared with the mayor’s office in Marshall.

By 3:20 p.m. the mayor’s office released a statement saying that Chief Holland had resigned, effective immediately.

Email requests for comment were not immediately returned by Mr. Holland on Monday. Efforts to reach Mr. Holland by phone were unsuccessful.

Kevin J. Elliott, Marshall’s mayor, said that Mr. Holland was hired as police chief about two years ago and that he was unaware of his political beliefs until Friday night, when he received screen shots of the chief’s posts on Parler from people around the country. On Saturday morning, Mr. Elliott said, he contacted lawyers from the Arkansas Municipal League, who informed him that he was within his rights to fire Mr. Holland.

Mr. Elliott summoned Chief Holland to a meeting at the Marshall City Hall at 1 p.m. Saturday and showed him the posts. Mr. Holland declined to answer the mayor’s questions and announced his decision to resign.

Mr. Elliott said that Mr. Holland quickly turned in the car, badge, cellphone and other items issued by the city, including a sawed-off shotgun. Mr. Holland carried his own sidearm on duty, which he retained, the mayor said.

“As far as the city attorneys are concerned, we’ve done what they asked us to do and they’re going to stand behind us,” Mayor Elliott said.

Mr. Foster said his organization was looking into Mr. Holland’s connections to the Arkansas Patriots, which he said was a local right-wing militia with ties to the larger Proud Boys network and advocates politically motivated violence.

Members of the Arkansas Patriots have been showing up at protests with firearms, Mr. Foster said, adding that many claim to be current or former members of law enforcement and the military. Mr. Holland, he said, had been spotted at such protests recently as part of a militia group.

After Mr. Holland resigned, Mr. Foster said the Ozark Mountain Proud Boys released a statement on Parler calling for Mr. Foster to be harmed. 

The Ozark Mountain Proud Boys did not respond to a message asking for comment on whether Mr. Holland was a member of their organization.

Mr. Holland’s calls for politically motivated violence were only the most recent ones he made on Parler, according to Mr. Foster. On Oct. 17, Mr. Holland called for Democrats to be hanged and said the F.B.I. and C.I.A. were Marxist organizations. Two days later he called for the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, to be tried for treason.

He also encouraged followers to throw water on Democrats while in restaurants and to push them off sidewalks, calling them “traitors” who “have no right to live in this Republic after what they have done.”

Aside from the former police chief, Marshall has three other full-time police officers and four part-time officers."
Who Will Fill Biden’s Cabinet?,"[This story is no longer being updated. Find the latest on President-elect Joseph R. Biden’s Cabinet picks here.]

President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has signaled his intention to draw from a diverse cross section of America in building his cabinet. Unlike President Trump’s cabinet, which is more white and male than any in nearly 40 years, Mr. Biden’s list of likely top advisers promises to reflect 21st-century sensibilities. He has already named several people to his national security team and the Treasury, and is expected to announce more selections in the coming days.

“Across the board — from our classrooms to our courtrooms to the president’s cabinet — we have to make sure that our leadership and our institutions actually look like America,” Mr. Biden wrote in an op-ed article last summer.

In naming the group, Mr. Biden must appease progressives within his own party while gaining support from Republicans who may still control the Senate. Mr. Biden is likely to include Republicans in his cabinet as he attempts to engineer a working relationship between the parties.

Mr. Biden’s transition team, led by former Senator Ted Kaufman of Delaware, a longtime confidant, already has been working on a list of candidates.

These are the people he has selected for his cabinet so far, and the names that have emerged as possible picks for other posts.

LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD: Ms. Thomas-Greenfield is a career Foreign Service officer who served as assistant secretary of state for African affairs from 2013 to 2017 and, before that, as ambassador to Liberia. Most recently, she has worked as senior counselor at Albright Stonebridge Group, a global business strategy firm based in Washington. 

AVRIL HAINES: A former deputy C.I.A. director and former deputy national security adviser, Ms. Haines held several posts at Columbia University since leaving the Obama administration. 

ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: A Cuban-American lawyer, Mr. Mayorkas was responsible for running Citizenship and Immigration Services at the department under Mr. Obama. He also served as a federal prosecutor in central California. Under Mr. Obama, Mr. Mayorkas was regarded as instrumental in negotiating a memorandum of understanding with Cuba.

JAKE SULLIVAN: Mr. Sullivan served as deputy chief of staff to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and as an adviser on national security issues to Mr. Biden when he was vice president. In the private sector, he co-founded National Security Action, a left-leaning policy advocacy group that opposed the Trump administration’s foreign policy. 

JOHN KERRY: A former Massachusetts senator and Democratic presidential nominee, Mr. Kerry clocked more than a million miles of travel while serving as secretary of state from 2013 to 2017. He has long expressed concerns about climate change, and the appointment of someone of his stature was regarded as a signal that the Biden administration intends to pay the issue serious attention. 

ANTONY BLINKEN: An aide to Mr. Biden on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Blinken previously served as Mr. Biden’s top foreign affairs adviser. He also served as deputy secretary of state during the Obama administration, as well as deputy national security adviser. More recently, he has been managing director of the Penn Biden Center, an international policy center at the University of Pennsylvania. He has also been a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times.

JANET L. YELLEN: Well known because of her high-profile service as chair of the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018, Ms. Yellen was also president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton. She is a labor economist who believes that government regulation and intervention are required to ensure that markets run efficiently.

While Mr. Biden has focused on setting down his national security team, there are several high-profile posts that he is expected to fill over the coming days and weeks, including the secretary of defense and the secretary of health and human services, who will play a critical role in the new administration’s response to the pandemic. Here are the leading contenders for these and other jobs.

HEIDI HEITKAMP: A former North Dakota senator who served on the Agriculture Committee, Ms. Heitkamp is a strong advocate for rural issues. She has criticized the Trump administration’s trade policies, which led to tariffs on soybean exports to China.

AMY KLOBUCHAR: A Minnesota senator, former prosecutor in Minneapolis and candidate for the Democratic nomination, Ms. Klobuchar, who was at one point in contention for Mr. Biden’s running mate, has advocated increasing support for agricultural commodities, disaster programs and federal crop insurance. (Ms. Klobuchar has also been mentioned as a possible attorney general.)

TOM DONILON: Mr. Donilon, who served as national security adviser under President Barack Obama, has been tied to Mr. Biden since 1987, when he worked on his first presidential campaign. A lawyer, he also oversaw the transition planning for the Clinton-Kaine campaign in 2016. 



MIKE MORELL: Mr. Morell is a former analyst at the C.I.A. who served as the agency’s deputy director and twice as its acting director. He is now in private business, chairing the geopolitical risk practice at Beacon Global Strategies, a consulting firm in Washington.

TAMMY DUCKWORTH: A former Army lieutenant colonel who lost both legs when her helicopter came under fire in Iraq in 2004, Ms. Duckworth, a senator from Illinois, was an assistant secretary of veterans affairs during the Obama administration. She was among women considered as Mr. Biden’s running mate. If appointed, she would become the first Thai-American cabinet member in addition to the first woman in the role of defense secretary. (Ms. Duckworth has also been mentioned as a potential secretary of veterans affairs.)

MICHÈLE A. FLOURNOY Ms. Flournoy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense, is regarded as the leading choice for this job. Ms. Flournoy, who would be the first woman in this role, has advised Mr. Biden’s campaign on defense issues and is regarded as highly qualified. Her industry ties — she serves on the board of the defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton — could annoy progressives.

JEH JOHNSON: Mr. Johnson is a former secretary of homeland security who previously served as general counsel at the Pentagon. He would be the first Black secretary of defense. His membership on the board of the defense contractor Lockheed Martin could be a sticking point for progressives. (Mr. Johnson has also been mentioned as a candidate for attorney general and director of national intelligence.)

LILY ESKELSEN GARCÍA: A former teacher and former president of the National Education Association, a labor union, Ms. Eskelsen García ran for Congress in Utah in 1998 and campaigned for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race. 

RANDI WEINGARTEN: Ms. Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, is a former Brooklyn public high school teacher who previously served as president of the United Federation of Teachers. 

JAY INSLEE: After failing to gain traction in his presidential bid — in which climate change was his primary focus — Mr. Inslee was easily re-elected to a third term as Washington’s governor. Environmental activists are promoting his name, pointing to his plan to close U.S. coal plants by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2045. (Mr. Inslee has also been promoted for appointment as secretary of the interior or head of the Environmental Protection Agency.)

ERNEST MONIZ: A nuclear physicist, Mr. Moniz served in the Obama administration as energy secretary, a job that largely involves managing the country’s nuclear arsenal. He played a critical role in negotiating technical details of the Iran nuclear deal. Since leaving the administration, he has been chief executive of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, which works to prevent nuclear, biological and cyber attacks.

ELIZABETH SHERWOOD-RANDALL: Ms. Sherwood-Randall is a professor at Georgia Tech who served in the Obama administration as deputy secretary of energy, where she managed the National Nuclear Security Administration and 17 federal laboratories. She also served as a White House adviser on weapons of mass destruction and arms control. During the Clinton administration, she worked as deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia.

MANDY COHEN: As the secretary of North Carolina’s Health and Human Services Department, Dr. Cohen is known for her ambitious effort to transform the way the state pays for health care. A physician, Dr. Cohen served as the chief operating officer at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the Obama administration.

DAVID KESSLER: A former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Kessler, a physician, was credited with tackling the tobacco industry and helping speed approval of more than a dozen drugs to treat H.I.V. In doing so, he worked closely with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert. 

MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: Ms. Lujan Grisham, the governor of New Mexico and a former member of Congress, also previously served as cabinet secretary for New Mexico’s departments of health and aging. Ms. Lujan Grisham who was among those considered for Mr. Biden’s running mate, was recently appointed as one of five co-chairs of Mr. Biden’s transition team. (Ms. Lujan Grisham also has been mentioned as a possible interior secretary.)

VIVEK MURTHY One of Mr. Biden’s top advisers on the coronavirus, Dr. Murthy is a former surgeon general and an outspoken advocate of more stringent gun control.

KAREN BASS: Ms. Bass, a longtime member of Congress from California, chairs the Congressional Black Caucus. A community organizer before she entered politics, she is well-versed on the housing challenges facing her South Los Angeles district. She was among the women Mr. Biden considered as his running mate. (A physician assistant by training, Ms. Bass has also been mentioned as a potential secretary of health and human services.)

ALVIN BROWN: A former mayor of Jacksonville, Fla., Mr. Brown was an adviser to Andrew Cuomo during his tenure as secretary of housing and urban development, worked on the Clinton-Gore transition team, and served at the Commerce Department during the Clinton administration. 

MAURICE JONES: Mr. Jones, a top deputy at the department during the Obama administration, he currently runs the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a financial institution that makes loans and provides grants to assist underserved communities. Mr. Jones also served as Virginia’s secretary of commerce under Gov. Terry McAuliffe.

KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS: The mayor of Atlanta, Ms. Bottoms has been a campaign surrogate for Mr. Biden and was among the women he considered as a running mate. Ms. Bottoms has made affordable housing a priority, proposing a $1 billion public-private initiative to improve access to housing in Atlanta.

DIANE YENTEL: Ms. Yentel leads the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a Washington-based nonprofit group that successfully opposed many of Mr. Trump’s proposed cuts to federal housing programs.

STEVE BULLOCK: The governor of Montana, Mr. Bullock recently lost a close Senate race to Steve Daines, a Republican incumbent. Mr. Bullock has been active in environmental issues: In 2014, he signed an executive order creating a habitat for sage grouse, and as state attorney general, he wrote an opinion guaranteeing access to public lands. 

DEB HAALAND: Indigenous groups are also promoting Representative Haaland of New Mexico, a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe. The Interior Department presides over millions of acres held in trust as tribal land. Ms. Haaland serves as vice chairwoman of the House Natural Resources Committee.

MARTIN HEINRICH: Yet another New Mexico resident mentioned for the interior job, Senator Heinrich, an avid outdoorsman, has promoted the idea of developing a national outdoor recreation plan using federal lands.

TOM UDALL: A New Mexico senator who decided not to run for a third term, Mr. Udall has fought to protect federal property from oil and gas drilling and has promoted the designation of wilderness areas in New Mexico. If Mr. Udall is picked, he will be keeping up a family tradition: His father, Stewart Udall, served as interior secretary during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.

XAVIER BECERRA: Mr. Becerra has developed a progressive track record as a California state official and during his career in Congress. He succeeded Vice President-elect Kamala Harris as California attorney general and is now widely viewed as a possible heir to her Senate seat. 

DOUG JONES: Following his unlikely Senate win in a special election in deep-red Alabama in 2017, Mr. Jones, a former federal prosecutor, was unable to hold on to his seat this year. He is widely admired within the party for pulling off that upset, as well as for his impeccable civil rights record. He is white, though, and some of Mr. Biden’s supporters may want the Justice Department in the hands of a Black or Latino attorney general.

TOM PEREZ: The Democratic Party chairman, Mr. Perez has had a long career in government, notably as secretary of labor and, earlier, as assistant attorney general for civil rights. In that role, he led a federal investigation of Trayvon Martin’s killing in Sanford, Fla., brought a lawsuit against the Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio for a pattern of abuses against Latinos, and enforced civil rights laws for gay and transgender people. (Mr. Perez has also been mentioned as a candidate for labor secretary.)

SALLY YATES: Ms. Yates, a former U.S. attorney in Atlanta and deputy attorney general, briefly held the role of acting attorney general during the early weeks of the Trump administration. Her tenure lasted 10 days; she was fired for insubordination by Mr. Trump when she advised him that the Justice Department could not defend his ban on travel to the United States by citizens of several Muslim-majority countries. 

SETH HARRIS: Mr. Harris, a former deputy labor secretary who served as acting secretary in 2013, also advised the Obama administration on legislation before the Senate. A lawyer, he is a fellow at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations.

ANDY LEVIN: The Michigan congressman is a former labor organizer for the Service Employees International Union and later the A.F.L.-C.I.O., where he was assistant director of organizing. He also worked as a staff lawyer in the Labor Department.

BERNIE SANDERS: The Vermont senator is interested in serving as labor secretary, according to a person close to him, and his camp and Mr. Biden’s team have been seriously discussing the possibility since he withdrew from the presidential race in April. There is no deal, and it is still unclear what role Mr. Sanders would play in a Biden administration.

JULIE SU: Ms. Su is the secretary of California’s Labor and Workforce Development Agency and a former California labor commissioner. She is an expert on workers’ rights and a past recipient of a MacArthur “genius” grant. 

ERIC GARCETTI: The Los Angeles mayor has promoted the use of public transportation during his administration, purchasing a clean-air bus fleet and proposing fare-free bus and train rides. He has also released a plan to eliminate traffic deaths by 2025.

PETE BUTTIGIEG: Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and a Democratic presidential candidate, is a former Navy officer who served in Afghanistan. As one of only two candidates for the Democratic nomination with military experience, Mr. Buttigieg, who is gay, was endorsed by a progressive group of veterans, VoteVets. (Mr. Buttigieg has also been mentioned as ambassador to the United Nations.)

ROBERT A. McDONALD: A former veterans affairs secretary during the Obama administration, Mr. McDonald could be making a return to his old job. An Army veteran and a former chief executive of Procter & Gamble, during his administration he placed an emphasis on reducing homelessness among veterans.

"Fighting Election Results, Trump Employs a New Weapon: The Government","WASHINGTON — President Trump, facing the prospect of leaving the White House in defeat in just 70 days, is harnessing the power of the federal government to resist the results of an election that he lost, something that no sitting president has done in American history.

In the latest sign of defiance, the president’s senior cabinet secretary fueled concerns on Tuesday that Mr. Trump would resist handing over power to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. after legal challenges to the vote. “There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.

Mr. Trump’s attorney general has at the same time authorized investigations into supposed vote fraud, his general services administrator has refused to give Mr. Biden’s team access to transition offices and resources guaranteed under law and the White House is preparing a budget for next year as if Mr. Trump will be around to present it.

The president has also embarked on a shake-up of his administration, firing Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper as well as the heads of three other agencies while installing loyalists in key positions at the National Security Agency and the Pentagon. Allies expect more to come, including the possible dismissals of the directors of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A.

But the rest of the world increasingly moved to accept Mr. Biden’s victory and prepared to work with him despite Mr. Trump’s refusal to acknowledge the results. Speaking with journalists, Mr. Biden called the president’s actions since Election Day “an embarrassment” that will not serve him well in the long run. “How can I say this tactfully?” Mr. Biden said. “It will not help the president’s legacy.”

The standoff left the United States in the position of the kind of country whose weak democratic processes it often criticizes. Rather than congratulating Mr. Biden and inviting him to the White House, as his predecessors traditionally have done after an election changed party control, Mr. Trump has been marshaling his administration and pressuring his Republican allies into acting as if the outcome were still uncertain, either out of faint hope of actually overturning the results or at least creating a narrative to explain his loss.

The president’s efforts to discredit with false claims both the election results and the incoming Biden administration is in many ways the culmination of four years of stocking the government with pliant appointees while undermining the credibility of other institutions in American life, including intelligence agencies, law enforcement authorities, the news media, technology companies, the federal government more broadly and now election officials in states across four time zones.

Throughout his presidency, Mr. Trump has tried to condition much of the American public not to believe anyone other than him, with evident success. Although the evidence shows there was no widespread conspiracy to steal the election in multiple states that Mr. Trump has invented, at least one poll showed that many supporters accept his claims. Seventy percent of Republicans surveyed by Politico and Morning Consult said they did not believe the election was free and fair.

“What we have seen in the last week from the president more closely resembles the tactics of the kind of authoritarian leaders we follow,” said Michael J. Abramowitz, the president of Freedom House, a nonprofit organization that tracks democracy around the world. “I never would have imagined seeing something like this in America.”

Mr. Abramowitz doubted there was much danger of Mr. Trump overturning the election. “But by convincing a large part of the population that there was widespread fraud, he is seeding a myth that could endure for years and contribute to an erosion of public confidence in our electoral system,” he said.

Mr. Biden has proceeded without waiting for Mr. Trump’s concession and spoke on Tuesday with the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Ireland. Most major world leaders have congratulated him on his victory, including close Trump allies like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, another Trump favorite, joined the chorus on Tuesday. The major holdouts remained Presidents Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Xi Jinping of China.

Mr. Biden said he was not overly concerned with the Trump administration’s refusal to provide transition money, offices and access to agencies, insisting he could assemble a government by his Jan. 20 inauguration. “We are going to be moving along in a consistent manner, putting together our administration, White House,” he said. “Nothing is going to stop us.”

Mr. Biden agreed that it would be helpful to have access to classified information like the presidential daily briefing, something an outgoing administration usually provides an incoming president. But he added, “The fact that they are not willing to acknowledge that we won at this point is not of much consequence to our planning.”

In a testy exchange with journalists at the State Department, Mr. Pompeo insisted that American efforts to prevent voter intimidation and ensure free and fair elections around the world were not diminished by Mr. Trump’s refusal to concede.

“We must count every legal vote,” Mr. Pompeo said, adopting the president’s language. “We must make sure that any vote that wasn’t lawful ought not be counted. That dilutes your vote if it’s done improperly.”

He snapped when asked if Mr. Trump’s delaying tactics undermined the State Department’s efforts to pressure political leaders abroad to accept losing results. “That’s ridiculous and you know it’s ridiculous, and you asked it because it’s ridiculous,” he said.

Mr. Pompeo can often be sarcastic, particularly when speaking to reporters, but the State Department made no effort to clarify if he was joking. Asked later on Fox News if he was serious, he did not say. “We will have a smooth transition,” he said. “And we will see what the people ultimately decided, when all the votes have been cast.”

transcript

Reporter: “Is the State Department currently preparing to engage with the Biden transition team? And if not, at what point does a delay hamper a smooth transition or pose a risk to national security?” “There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration. All right, we’re ready. The world is watching what’s taking place. We’re going to count all the votes. When the process is complete, they’ll be electors selected. There’s a process — the Constitution lays it out pretty clearly. The world should have every confidence that the transition necessary to make sure that the State Department is functional today, successful today and successful with the president who’s in office on Jan. 20, a minute after noon, will also be successful. I went through a transition on the front, and I’ve been on the other side of this. I’m very confident that we will do all the things that are necessary to make sure that the government, the United States goverment, will continue to perform its national security function as we go forward.” Reporter: “Do you believe there’s widespread voter fraud? The reports that we’re getting from Pennsylvania, from Michigan, showing vote totals of massive leads or significant leads with 99 percent reporting are going to be overturned, and that the United States failed to conduct a fraudulent-free election?” “Rich, I’m the secretary of state. I’m getting calls from all across the world. These people are watching our election. They understand that we have a legal process. They understand that this takes time. Right — took us 37-plus days in an election back in 2000. Conducted a successful transition then, I’m very confident that we will count, and we must count, every legal vote. We must make sure that any vote that wasn’t lawful ought not be counted. That dilutes your vote if it’s done improperly. Got to get that right. When we get it right, we’ll get it right — we’re in good shape.”

His comments provoked a backlash from career diplomats, including criticism of his glib tone and outright concerns that the Trump administration would try to steal the election. But Mr. Trump congratulated him later on Twitter: “That’s why Mike was number one in his class at West Point!”

The delay in acknowledging the results has left American embassies in limbo. At least some embassy officials have been told to steer clear of any efforts to help Mr. Biden with foreign leaders who want to congratulate him, as they normally would during a transition. Diplomats said they could not even begin enumerating the successes of the Trump administration for fear of describing it in the past tense.

Some ambassadors sought to straddle the line of neutrality even as they pointedly did not recognize Mr. Biden as the victor. “It’s been a hard fought race that has shown us the American spirit of both grit and resilience,” Robert “Woody” Johnson, the ambassador to Britain, said on Twitter. “Nothing in the history of America worth achieving has ever come easy.”

Other envoys echoed the president’s allegations of voter fraud. “Please don’t disenfranchise me and my fellow voters in order to win at all costs,” Carla Sands, the ambassador to Denmark, said on her personal Twitter page. By way of evidence, she posted a screenshot of a State Department website that could not track her absentee ballot.

“Secretary Pompeo shouldn’t play along with baseless and dangerous attacks on the legitimacy of last week’s election,” said Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “The State Department should now begin preparing for President-elect Biden’s transition.”

In extending his purge of the Pentagon on Tuesday, Mr. Trump replaced three more policy officials with loyalists. Some Defense Department officials worried that the replacements could be more amenable to striking American adversaries than their predecessors were.

James Anderson, the acting under secretary of defense for policy who was at odds with the White House, stepped down and was effectively replaced by Anthony Tata, who became “the senior official performing the duties of the under secretary of defense for policy,” as the announcement put it.

Mr. Tata, a retired Army one-star general who has called Islam “the most oppressive violent religion” and referred to former President Barack Obama as a “terrorist leader,” withdrew from consideration for the top Pentagon policy job in August amid opposition from both Republican and Democratic senators. The president also installed Kashyap Patel, a former aide to Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California, who played a key role in helping Republicans try to undermine the Russia investigation, as chief of staff to the new acting defense secretary, Christopher Miller, adding alarm at the Pentagon over moves to stock the department leadership with loyalists.

Mr. Trump’s allies said the president was justified in fighting the election results even if he was not successful, citing what they deem illegitimate court decisions expanding mail-in voting.

“In light of the Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court’s unconstitutional de facto legislation enacted through its rulings, along with the coming 2022 U.S. Senate and governor races, the Trump campaign’s litigation is essential for Republicans to have a fair playing field in the long term no matter the short term result,” Sam Nunberg, an adviser to Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign, said by email.

Only nine sitting presidents before Mr. Trump lost bids for another term in a general election (a few others were not renominated by their party), and some like John Adams and John Quincy Adams were sour enough to skip their successors’ inaugurations. But none resisted leaving office or made claims of widespread conspiracy to reverse the outcome.

“We have not seen any president in history lose re-election, refuse to concede defeat and take actions that threaten the abuse of presidential power to keep himself in office,” said Michael Beschloss, a prominent presidential historian. “Here, Donald Trump is yet again in a historical category of his own — and this time, it is ominous for democracy.”

Richard Norton Smith, who wrote a biography of Herbert Hoover and is writing one on Gerald R. Ford, two of the nine, recalled Hoover’s anger at the man who beat him, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and their frosty car ride to the inauguration in March 1933.

“But the point is Hoover, however embittered he was over F.D.R.’s unwillingness to cooperate, as he defined the term, shared the same car, just as he had welcomed the Roosevelts for the ritualistic pre-inaugural tea the night before,” Mr. Smith said. “They might despise one another, but their personal animosity was outweighed by their commitment to the democratic process.”

The parallel often cited is when Vice President Al Gore pushed for recounts in Florida in 2000 to overcome a slim lead by his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. But Mr. Gore was not the incumbent, and President Bill Clinton did not direct the administration to intervene, although it did withhold transition resources from Mr. Bush until the fight was resolved.

“We were so darn careful not to use any government resources, funds, staff or even a paper clip,” said Donna Brazile, who was Mr. Gore’s campaign manager.

In Florida, Mr. Gore had a plausible chance to change the outcome of the election, given that he was down by only 327 votes in a single state after the automatic machine recount. Mr. Trump, by contrast, is behind by tens of thousands of votes in multiple states that would have to switch, which has never happened on that scale.

“The big difference,” Ms. Brazile said, “is this feels like a major P.R. campaign being waged in the courts to sully the voters where Trump lost or underperformed versus shaping a much larger narrative that this election was so-called rigged.”

Pandemic Reaches Grim Milestone as Biden Moves to Take Charge,"WILMINGTON, Del. — Coronavirus cases surged to a new record on Monday, with the United States now averaging 111,000 cases each day for the past week, a grim milestone amid rising hospitalizations and deaths that cast a shadow on positive news about the effectiveness of a potential vaccine.

As the number of infected Americans passed 10 million and governors struggled to manage the pandemic, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. tried on Monday to use his bully pulpit — the only tool at his disposal until he replaces President Trump in 72 days — to plead for Americans to set aside the bitterness of the 2020 election and wear a mask.

“It doesn’t matter who you voted for, where you stood before Election Day,” Mr. Biden said in Delaware after announcing a Covid-19 advisory board charged with preparing for quick action once he is inaugurated. “It doesn’t matter your party, your point of view. We can save tens of thousands of lives if everyone would just wear a mask for the next few months. Not Democratic or Republican lives — American lives.”

Hours before Mr. Biden’s remarks, the drug maker Pfizer announced that an early analysis of its coronavirus vaccine trial suggested the vaccine was robustly effective in preventing Covid-19, a promising development that sent stock prices soaring. The world has waited anxiously for any positive sign that there will be an end to the pandemic that has killed more than 1.2 million people worldwide.

“It’s extraordinary,” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, said on CNN. “It is really a big deal.”

Mr. Biden called the development “excellent news” but cautioned that the country was still “facing a very dark winter.” The average daily death toll in the United States is inching back toward 1,000, and hospitals nationwide are strained with patients. The president-elect said that Americans would need to rely on basic precautions, like wearing masks, to “get back to normal as fast as possible.”

“It’s clear that this vaccine, even if approved, will not be widely available for many months yet to come,” he said. “The challenge before us right now is still immense and growing.”

The sheer breadth of that challenge was striking on Monday: More than 784,000 cases have been announced in the United States over the past week, more than in any other week of the pandemic. The country now averages 900 deaths each day, and 28 states added more cases in the seven-day period ending Sunday than in any other weeklong stretch of the pandemic. No states are reporting sustained reductions in cases.

Coronavirus hospitalizations, perhaps the clearest measure of how many people are severely ill, are approaching record levels set during earlier surges of the pandemic, according to data collected by the Covid Tracking Project. A wave of more than 59,200 patients threatened to overwhelm hospitals in communities across the country on Monday.

The outlook is especially grim in the Midwest and Great Plains, where North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Wisconsin and Nebraska had more new cases per capita over the past week than any others. In the Iowa county that includes Des Moines, more than 400 cases are being identified on an average day. In Milwaukee County, Wis., around 900 new cases are emerging each day. The Nebraska county that includes Omaha is averaging about 460 cases daily, a roughly threefold increase in one month. In Ohio, reports of new cases have risen by 91 percent over the past two weeks.

At the White House, which has been the site of several high-profile outbreaks in recent months, Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, tested positive for the coronavirus on Monday, according to a spokesman for the agency. He became the latest in a long list of administration officials, including Mr. Trump himself, to contract the virus.

At least three people who attended an election party at the White House last week, including Mr. Carson, have tested positive for the virus. At the event, several hundred people gathered in the East Room for several hours, many of them not wearing masks as they mingled while watching the election returns.

David Bossie, an adviser to Mr. Trump who attended the election night party, tested positive on Sunday, two people familiar with the diagnosis said. Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, tested positive for the virus the day after the election, aides said, although he tried to keep it quiet.

Mr. Carson, a neurosurgeon who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, has defended Mr. Trump’s response to the virus and is a member of the White House virus task force. An aide said he was in “good spirits” but declined to specify his treatments.

Beyond the impact of the virus itself, when Mr. Biden takes office, he will face a sobering economic reality.

Even as the Dow Jones industrial average gained nearly 3 percent on news of the vaccine, the economy remained depressed by the spread of the virus. There were 10 million fewer Americans working in October than in February, according to the Labor Department, and the pace of job growth has slowed every month since June. Airlines and other tourism-related industries are nowhere close to regaining their normal levels of customers. And several indicators suggest consumers have pulled back on dining and some other activities in recent weeks as infections have surged anew.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York raised doubts that the Trump administration could handle vaccine distribution, even if a vaccine did become available in the coming weeks, suggesting that governors would have to step in.

“The Trump administration is rolling out the vaccination plan, and I believe it’s flawed,” Mr. Cuomo said Monday on “Good Morning America” on ABC. “They’re basically going to have the private providers do it, and that’s going to leave out all sorts of communities that were left out the first time when Covid ravaged them.”

Mr. Biden, moving to signal to Americans that he is prepared to take charge after a chaotic year, named a new coronavirus task force headed by a former commissioner of food and drugs, Dr. David Kessler; a former surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy; and a Yale public health expert, Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith.

Mr. Biden will have the difficult task of governing a country that is deeply divided about how much the government should do to slow the virus at the expense of jobs, schooling, recreation, socializing and religious gatherings. The president-elect vowed to “spare no effort” in fighting the virus, with the goal of getting the economy “running at full speed again.”

His comments contrasted Mr. Trump’s. The president has spent the past eight months dismissing or playing down the need for Americans to wear masks, saying frequently — and falsely — that public health experts disagree about masks’ effectiveness.

Vice President Mike Pence, who serves as the chairman of Mr. Trump’s coronavirus task force, convened the group on Monday after meeting about once a week over the past several months. But Mr. Trump, who remains in office until January, is openly at odds with his own virus advisers, including about mask wearing.

The wave of cases sweeping through much of the country remains largely a matter for state and local officials whose citizens are divided over the need for restrictions, impatient to improve the economy and fatigued by the pandemic.

Unlike in the spring, when a vast majority of states issued stay-at-home orders for at least a few weeks, there has been no broad agreement around such sweeping measures. More than half of the states issued mask mandates at some point this year, and some officials have tried targeted shutdowns on bars and indoor dining. But public health officials acknowledge that there is little public appetite for a return to full lockdowns.

That has left governors and mayors racing to sort through new restrictions while trying not to alienate their constituents.

In Utah, Gov. Gary Herbert, a Republican, declared on Sunday that local hospitals were full and that a mask mandate and two-week state of emergency would begin immediately.

“We are in the midst of a serious pandemic,” he said in a videotaped message that was sent to residents’ cellphones. “The number of infections in our state is growing at an alarming rate.”

Mr. Herbert, who has been slow to enact restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus, announced new rules that would apply statewide, including canceling high school extracurricular activities and limiting social gatherings to within households.

But he did not close bars or restaurants and declined to impose restrictions on churches.

In Utah, the increase in coronavirus cases — more than 2,000 new infections a day — has sent ripples of alarm throughout Salt Lake City. Stores began limiting purchases of certain items like toilet paper and cleaning supplies. Shelves in a local Costco last weekend were low on staples like pasta and flour.

In Nebraska, Gov. Pete Ricketts, a Republican, announced a series of specific restrictions on Monday that stopped short of any sweeping directive. People can still eat indoors at restaurants, but dining will be limited to eight people per table. Masks will be required in some businesses — but only if there is close contact between people for 15 minutes or more. Dancing at weddings will not be allowed — unless people dance at their own tables.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois said on Monday that he would impose more stringent restrictions on three regions of the state, including suburbs of Chicago and Southern Illinois, that are seeing surges in coronavirus infections.

“The virus is winning the war by now,” Mr. Pritzker said, urging the public to wear masks. “The situation has worsened considerably in certain areas of the state.”

In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio warned on Monday that the city was “getting dangerously close” to a second wave and said that further lockdowns were possible if New Yorkers did not regain control of the virus. “Unfortunately, it could mean even having to shut down parts of our economy again,” he said.

At Mr. Biden’s closed-door briefing with his Covid advisory board, which took place remotely over a video conference call on Monday, three leaders of the panel provided updates on the pandemic while others members of the group introduced themselves, according to a person familiar with the discussion.

One member, Dr. Rick Bright, is a former top vaccine official in the Trump administration who was ousted as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. He told lawmakers that officials in the government had failed to heed his warnings about acquiring masks and other supplies.

“Lives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost,” Dr. Bright told a House subcommittee in May.

Christian Conservatives Respond to Trump’s Loss and Look Ahead,"When President Trump won the White House four years ago in a surprise victory, conservative Christians could not believe their good fortune.

At every turn of his presidency, he gave them everything they wanted: Two hundred federal judges appointed for life. An embassy in Jerusalem. Anti-abortion policies. Two Supreme Court Justices, and then in the final hours, a third. He was their bulwark, their defender, at a time when the country as they knew it, and their place in it, was changing. And he brought their movement to a pinnacle of political maturity.

Now the election of Joseph R. Biden Jr. marks a new chapter for conservative Christian power, which reached a peak under Mr. Trump. As Republican evangelicals around the country processed the week’s events, they reflected on how much they had gained in the last four years and on their fears over what could happen under a Biden administration. They also wondered when and how they would regain power.

In Sheldon, Iowa, where about eight out of ten voters supported Mr. Trump, Leah Schoonhoven journaled her concerns about a Biden presidency over three single-spaced pages. She worried that the election results were corrupted, and that Mr. Biden would reverse Mr. Trump’s priorities, from building the border wall to elevating conservative evangelical ideals on religious freedom.

“He doesn’t stand for Christianity at all; maybe he will prove me wrong,” she said of Mr. Biden, who is Catholic. “It scares me. He’s not going to do everything that Trump did.”

“I don’t think our world will ever get back, when you have a country that is this divided,” she said.

Donna Rigney, a pastor whose church meets in the lodge of an R.V. park in Salt Springs, Fla., had supported the president since 2016, when she received what she saw as a direct message from God supporting his candidacy.

After this election, she sent an email to the people in her prayer circles urging them not to give up. “We have to drag Donald Trump over the finish line with prayers of faith, worship, fasting and staying in the place of loving and forgiving our enemies,” she wrote.

But she said Friday that if this did turn out to be the end of the Trump era, she was grateful for what he had done for the country, and comforted that he would suffer fewer attacks. “He will be fine, he has God’s hand on him,” she said. “He’ll be better off not being the president and not being attacked daily. But I really feel this will be terrible for the nation.”

Mr. Trump’s presidency repeatedly revealed the deep divide between white conservative Christians and other people of faith, or of no faith at all. Mr. Biden’s narrow margin of victory in several battleground states revealed that the cultural clash between these groups is far from over. About eight in ten white evangelical voters supported Mr. Trump in the 2020 election, according to AP VoteCast, just as they did in 2016. Mr. Biden’s coalition included many Black Protestants, Hispanic Catholics, and religiously unaffiliated Americans.

Mr. Trump did win a larger share of support from Latino voters overall, though, compared with four years ago. And for Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, a Sacramento pastor who prayed at Mr. Trump’s 2017 inauguration, the lesson from the 2020 election was that Latinos had become what he called “the quintessential swing vote.”

Mr. Rodriguez saw one legacy of the Trump era redefining American evangelicals’ former approach to the question of politicians’ character. Their loyalty to Mr. Trump, which had required overlooking language and behavior they found abhorrent, proved that personal character isn’t everything to them, given how many tangible goals were achieved.

“The policies are absolutely remarkable,” he said.

Voting for a person like Donald Trump would have been unimaginable to evangelicals 40 years ago, when they emerged as a powerful faction behind the victory of Ronald Reagan, said R. Albert Mohler, Jr., president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky.

Today, “they feel the wind facing them,” he said, “with a clear sense that the culture is becoming reordered in a hostile and increasingly secular manner. Evangelicals are voting with the same values, but with a different set of priorities.”

Mr. Mohler did not vote for Mr. Trump in 2016. But this year, he spoke publicly about his plans to vote for the president despite his continuing reservations, calling the alternative to a Trump victory “increasingly unthinkable.”

Like the president, a number of evangelical leaders refused to accept an outcome in which Mr. Trump had lost. Moments after most major news networks calculated that Mr. Biden had won the race, Franklin Graham, the evangelist, cautioned that the results were not “official.”

And Mr. Graham warned that under a Biden administration, Christian businesses would be soon be targeted for things like not selling a cake for a gay wedding, as he said happened during Mr. Obama’s presidency.

“America is in such moral decline,” he said. “We are becoming a much more violent country. I am afraid for our country.”

In Texas, Robert Jeffress, pastor of First Baptist Dallas, reserved billboards across the city to advertise his upcoming sermon on how Christians should respond to a Biden presidency.

“There are going to be millions of Christians who are disappointed in these results,” he said.

“A Joe Biden win cannot erase all the positive accomplishments that can be attributed to President Trump,” he said. “I don’t think there is any way to calculate all the good things he has accomplished.”

Some social conservative political groups were already pivoting to other political fights, such as protecting Republican control of the Senate, which could be decided by two runoff elections in Georgia in January. Continued Republican control of the Senate could buffer their accomplishments under Mr. Trump, and make it harder for Democrats to do things like fund Planned Parenthood or increase the size of the Supreme Court, several organizers said.

“To plan for the Biden administration, we’ve got to have a backstop; otherwise it is the Armageddon we feared in the beginning,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List. “That’s why Georgia is so vital. The other side knows that, too.”

On Saturday, as the Biden campaign declared victory, the Faith and Freedom Coalition began knocking on doors across the state, and prepared to distribute one million voter guides to 4,000 churches.

Social conservatives also celebrated the election to the House of at least 15 new women who oppose abortion rights, more than doubling their numbers in the previous Congress. About half of the 15 flipped seats that had been in Democratic hands.

And social conservatives had another reason to stay positive: Even though Mr. Trump had lost, they believed that the conservative control of the judiciary that he enabled would have a lasting impact.

“When Amy Coney Barrett writes the majority decision protecting Christian foster care and adoption agencies, I’m going to celebrate,” Penny Nance, president of Concerned Women for America, said. “We put some points on the board.”"
Who’s Going to Tell Him? Republicans Shy From Asking Trump to Concede,"WASHINGTON — Since President Trump was elected, his relationships with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill have mostly fallen into one of two categories: the unbreakable bond with his most ardent followers, who defend him at all costs, and the tenuous, strained alliance with the rest, who share his agenda but often cringe privately at his language and tactics.

Neither group is particularly well suited for the chore of trying to persuade Mr. Trump, who refuses to concede the election, that it is time to step aside — or at the very least, to stop spreading claims about the integrity of the nation’s elections that are contrary to considerable evidence. And there is little chance that Mr. Trump, who has been perplexed and sometimes enraged by the Republican institutionalists who might normally be expected to play such a role, would listen if they did.

The dynamic helps explain why, days after President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. was declared the winner of the election, even Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, was unwilling to recognize the result. Instead, senators have tiptoed around — or in some cases blindly run past — the reality of Mr. Trump’s loss, and the lack of evidence to suggest widespread election fraud or improprieties that could reverse that result.

“There is no bipartisanship to speak of, in terms of how many members are willing to speak up — and would it matter to him? Would he listen?” said William S. Cohen, a former senator and House member from Maine who was one of the first Republicans to break from his party and support the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon. “Trump doesn’t care a whit about the House or Senate, and he rules by fear. He still can inflame his supporters — there are 70 million out there. He still carries that fear factor.”

By Tuesday, a club of only a few Republican senators known for their distaste for Mr. Trump — Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — had acknowledged Mr. Biden’s victory.

In times past, lawmakers might have marched down to the White House to level with the president of their own party about political reality. Instead, Vice President Mike Pence went up to Capitol Hill on Tuesday and kept Mr. Trump’s false narrative alive, telling Republican senators over lunch that he and the president would keep fighting the election results and detailing the legal moves they were taking in states around the country to challenge the outcome.

Mr. McConnell, who is poised to be the top Republican in Washington during the coming Biden administration, continued to decline to recognize Mr. Biden’s victory and played down Mr. Trump’s denial of his defeat and evidence-free claims of election fraud.

“I think we ought to quit all the hand-wringing and not act like this is extraordinary,” Mr. McConnell told reporters after the luncheon. “We’re going to get through this period and we’ll swear in the winner” in January, he said, “just like we have every four years.”

Far from trying to influence the president’s thinking, most Republicans have gone out of their way to avoid seeming to dictate what he should do.

In an extensive statement on Tuesday, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio refrained from recognizing Mr. Biden’s victory and argued that Mr. Trump “has every right to insist that all legally cast ballots are counted.”

But in an indication of how carefully some Republicans are treading amid the president’s outlandish accusations, Mr. Portman added, “At the same time, the Trump campaign has an obligation to come forward with evidence to support any allegations of election fraud.”

Some of Mr. Trump’s acolytes, on the other hand, have rushed to advance his baseless theories of fraud. Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue of Georgia, both of whom are facing runoff elections in January, demanded the resignation of their state’s top election official, a fellow Republican, after he said there was no evidence of widespread fraud in the state’s elections.

Asked by a reporter if he had congratulated Mr. Biden on his victory, Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, replied that he had not.

“Nothing to congratulate him about,” Mr. Johnson said tersely.

Mr. Biden, speaking at a news conference in Wilmington, Del., brushed off the chilly response he had received so far from congressional Republicans — but not before working in a jab at the president, calling his refusal to concede “an embarrassment, quite frankly.”

“I haven’t had a chance to speak to Mitch,” he said of Mr. McConnell, with whom he has a decades-long relationship. “My expectation is that I will in the not-too-distant future. The whole G.O.P. has been put in a position, with a few notable exceptions, of being mildly intimidated by the sitting president.”

In 1974, as Mr. Nixon faced the Watergate scandal and the strong likelihood of impeachment and conviction, a cadre of powerful Republican lawmakers went to the White House and one by one, naming lawmakers in their own party who were prepared to vote to convict him, told him it was time to go. The message was clear, and Mr. Nixon announced his resignation the next day.

Expect no such reckoning for Mr. Trump, said Timothy Naftali, the founding director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum and a professor at New York University.

“It’s very difficult for Republicans whose leader got 71 million votes, the most by any Republican standard-bearer ever, to simply just turn their backs on him,” Mr. Naftali said. “The issue is now not so much Trump as loyalty to Trumpism. And I think that’s why you see the contortions now. If you’re a Republican and you get this wrong, you’re going to be primaried out.”

There is a more immediate concern for the party, too. With Mr. Perdue and Ms. Loeffler facing elections whose outcomes are likely to determine control of the Senate, Republicans are reluctant to do anything to dampen the enthusiasm of their conservative base. Any hint that leaders were prodding Mr. Trump to exit the stage could provoke a Twitter rampage from the president that could turn his supporters against the party at a critical time.

“The Republican Party hemorrhaged seats in 1974 after Watergate, after the near-impeachment of a Republican president,” Mr. Naftali said, while Republican lawmakers appear on track to gain House seats this year after Democrats’ impeachment of Mr. Trump. “So what is the lesson for politicos? The lesson is not to run away from Trump.”

Still, some Republicans have argued in recent days that it is crucial for members of their party to push back in a measured way against the president’s unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud.

On Monday, 31 former Republican members of Congress — many of them outspoken critics of the president — denounced Mr. Trump’s allegations in an open letter that called on him to accept the election results.

“We believe the statements by President Trump alleging fraud in the election are efforts to undermine the legitimacy of the election and are unacceptable,” wrote the group, led by former Representative Tom Coleman of Missouri. “Every vote should be counted and the final outcome accepted by the participants because public confidence in the outcome of our elections is a bedrock of our democracy.”

Barbara Comstock, a Republican former House member from Virginia who signed the letter, said she did so because skeptical voters “have got to come to the understanding and see that this isn’t real.”

Her former colleagues, Ms. Comstock added, had largely come to the conclusion privately that Mr. Trump’s legal challenges “aren’t going anywhere.”

“Their facade is crumbling,” she said. “It’s inevitably going where it’s going. We’ve just got to responsibly explain to people why this isn’t true.”

A House Divided,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host.

After more than two dozen presidential candidates, nearly two years of campaigning and close to $14 billion, America exits the long election much as it entered: a fiercely divided nation deeply worried about the future.

With many votes left to be counted in Democratic-leaning cities, President-elect Joe Biden has won almost 4.5 million more votes than President Trump, rebuilding his party’s “blue wall” in the industrial North and making inroads into the Sun Belt. But Mr. Trump also expanded his margin of support, collecting over eight million more votes from a somewhat more diverse coalition of voters than he did in 2016.

This election was not the national renunciation of Trumpism that progressives dreamed it would be. Nor was the outcome a clear sign that voters believed “far-left” protests had plunged America into lawlessness and decline, as conservatives had argued.

Instead, we remain a house divided. Often, even inside the same house.

Sure, some of our politics shifted since 2016. Suburban counties tilted away from Mr. Trump by nearly a five-point margin. And Mr. Trump won a larger portion of Latino and Black voters. (Who saw that coming? Oh wait, we did.)

But so much seemed to be decided on the margins. Democrats did not sweep down-ballot races, as most expected, leaving control of Congress possibly unchanged. While Mr. Biden won the most votes in history, Mr. Trump won the second-most votes.

Four years ago, Mr. Trump flipped Wisconsin from the Democrats by 22,748 votes. This year, Mr. Biden won it back, but his margin is on track to be just as close.

Much has changed since April 2019, when Mr. Biden announced his presidential bid. Yesterday, the country crossed the grim milestone of 10 million reported coronavirus cases, with new cases up nearly 60 percent from two weeks earlier. Millions more Americans are unemployed, struggling to pay their bills and slipping into poverty.

Through it all, Mr. Biden made national unity a central part of his campaign message. From his earliest days as the Democratic nominee to his victory speech on Saturday night, he vowed to be “a president for all Americans,” even those who didn’t vote for him.

Fostering unity in Washington won’t be easy. The Senate is no longer the collegial place where Mr. Biden worked for decades. Like the country, it has become more ideological and more polarized.

Dual victories in Georgia’s runoff elections early next year would give Democrats the tiebreaking vote in the Senate. But split control, with Senator Mitch McConnell remaining as majority leader, seems the more likely outcome.

Some goals may be easier for the new administration to achieve. Both parties have expressed a desire to pass another round of coronavirus relief, though they have sharply disagreed on the size of a stimulus. Other parts of Mr. Biden’s agenda, like passing a public health insurance option, combating climate change, raising the minimum wage and tackling racial justice, will be impossible to fully achieve without some bipartisan cooperation.

Even in defeat, Mr. Trump still holds a tight grasp on the Republican Party. In the Senate, only three Republicans have acknowledged Mr. Biden’s victory, fearing alienating a party base that still stands by a president who refuses to concede.

Speaking on the Senate floor today, Mr. McConnell declined to recognize Mr. Biden as the president-elect — even as he acknowledged his party’s down-ballot victories by meeting with Republicans who were newly elected to the Senate.

“President Trump is 100 percent within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,” Mr. McConnell said.

So, after all these years of fighting, just how politically divided is America? We can’t even seem to agree that we have a president-elect.

It has been a long road, but we made it. The election is over, and many of you are having … all the feelings. We want to hear about them!

What are you most looking forward to, now that the election is over? I know everyone will miss those constant news alerts. And what makes you hopeful or worried when you think about the future of the country?

Helping to Shape the Words of the President-Elect: A Presidential Historian,"WASHINGTON — Jon Meacham, the presidential historian and biographer best known for studying the lives of past presidents, has taken on a relatively unique role in a contemporary political moment: helping to write speeches for the next president.

Mr. Meacham has had a hand in crafting many of Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s biggest rhetorical moments, according to multiple sources, including helping to write the acceptance speech that Mr. Biden delivered on Saturday night from Wilmington, Del., his first remarks as the president-elect.

In that address, Mr. Biden spoke of a mission “to rebuild the soul of America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class, and to make America respected around the world again” and was widely credited with striking the right tone about bringing the country back together. The language echoed the title of Mr. Meacham’s 2018 book, “The Soul of America: The Battle for Our Better Angels,” which has long served as a touchstone for Mr. Biden, who has reached out to Mr. Meacham in the past to discuss passages he liked.

“To record history doesn’t mean you are removed from it,” Mr. Meacham said over the summer, noting that he had been friends with Mr. Biden for a long time.

Mr. Biden’s speech-writing process is run by Mike Donilon, his longtime adviser. But behind the scenes, Mr. Meacham has been playing a larger role than was previously known, writing drafts of speeches and offering edits on others, including one Mr. Biden gave in Gettysburg, Pa., last month and his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in August.

“President-elect Joe Biden wrote the speech he delivered to the American people on Saturday night, which laid out his vision for uniting and healing the nation,” said TJ Ducklo, a spokesman for Mr. Biden.

“Given the significance of the speech, he consulted a number of important and diverse voices as part of his writing process, as he often does,” Mr. Ducklo added. A Biden official said that Mr. Meacham was involved in discussions about the themes in the victory speech.

Mr. Meacham, who has voted for presidents from both parties and wrote a favorable biography of former President George H.W. Bush, has played an unusual role during the 2020 campaign. He publicly endorsed Mr. Biden in an op-ed in The Washington Post in March and received a prime speaking slot at the Democratic convention.

In that speech, he addressed the nation from his home in Nashville and warned that “our democracy is under assault from an incumbent more interested in himself than he is in the rest of us.” He called the choice that voters faced in November “a choice that goes straight to the nature of the soul of America.”

Mr. Meacham is not expected to join the administration. But his connection to Mr. Biden recalls the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.’s relationship with President John F. Kennedy. Mr. Schlesinger worked for Mr. Kennedy’s campaign and as a member of his White House staff, and later chronicled his presidency.

Mr. Biden’s reliance on a historian stands in contrast with President Trump’s lack of interest in the past. Mr. Biden is known as a person who likes to use historical analogies in his public speeches and his own thinking, and historians have said that it made sense he would want someone like Mr. Meacham involved in the speech-writing process.

“The fear of that kind of work is you get labeled a court historian and are seen as being hyperpartisan,” said Douglas Brinkley, a history professor at Rice University. “But if anyone can pull it off, Meacham can. He’s liked by moderate Republicans. He’s a best-selling writer. He’s a wordsmith, and that’s what Biden needs. He’s probably able to keep a foot in both worlds.”

Mr. Brinkley added that Mr. Meacham was uniquely suited to help Mr. Biden with weaving “patriotic lore” into his speeches.

Mr. Meacham declined to comment on his role.

During the Trump years, Mr. Meacham had also been a regular presence on MSNBC and NBC News broadcasts. But as of Monday, he was not a paid contributor at the network, according to two people familiar with the decision. Mr. Meacham was expected to return to NBC as an unpaid guest and could resume his paid role next year, possibly after the inauguration, the people said. NBC declined to comment.

Indeed, Mr. Meacham appeared on MSNBC before and after Mr. Biden’s acceptance speech on Saturday. About half an hour after Mr. Biden had concluded, the anchor Brian Williams introduced Mr. Meacham by saying, “I’m not the historian that you are, and I don’t have the Pulitzer that you do, but do you concur that is the way we are used to hearing from our presidents?”

“Absolutely,” Mr. Meacham responded, without disclosing that he had been involved in the writing of the speech.

Shortly before Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and Mr. Biden took the stage, Mr. Meacham commented on the symbolism of a new administration featuring a 77-year-old institutionalist and a vice president-elect “who represents in many ways the changing demography of the country.”

“It’s poetic,” Mr. Meacham said. “There’s a lot of poetry tonight.”"
The G.O.P. Lines Up Behind Trump,"Republicans coalesce around Trump’s election spin, as Democrats regroup after feeling “gutted” by the congressional results. It’s Tuesday, and this is your politics tip sheet. Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.

Speaking on the Senate floor yesterday for the first time since the election, Mitch McConnell threw his weight behind President Trump’s efforts to cast doubt on the outcome of the presidential race, saying that Trump was “100 percent within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options.”

McConnell, the majority leader, openly celebrated the Republican Party’s victories in key Senate races — victories that relied upon the same ballots Trump has baselessly called fraudulent.

Speaking immediately after him, the Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, called Trump’s claims “extremely dangerous, extremely poisonous to our democracy,” and called on his Republican colleagues to reject them. “Republican leaders must unequivocally condemn the president’s rhetoric and work to ensure the peaceful transfer of power,” Schumer said.

Susan Collins, the moderate senator from Maine who won re-election last week, became only the fourth Republican in the Senate to break ranks with her party and acknowledge Joe Biden’s win. In a statement, she congratulated him on his “apparent victory” and argued that it was important to begin the transfer of power. “He loves this country, and I wish him every success,” Collins said.

The nation is now left hanging between the apparent completion of a successful, generally well-run election amid difficult circumstances, and unfounded claims of fraud and mismanagement. As is often true of Trump’s falsehoods, they’re difficult to refute because they’re not founded on much of anything, other than a pattern of earlier fictions.

On Fox News, even the conservative commentator Neil Cavuto cut away from the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, as she spoke at a news conference yesterday, making broad and unfounded claims about election mismanagement in Pennsylvania.

“I can’t in good countenance continue showing you this,” Cavuto said, adding that he would willingly cut back to McEnany if she presented any verifiable evidence to support her assertions.

At the General Services Administration, the Trump-appointed director has also refused to officially acknowledge the election results, a significant impediment to the transition process.

William Barr, the attorney general, told federal prosecutors on Monday that they could investigate accusations of voter fraud before the results of the presidential race were certified, though he cautioned that “specious, speculative, fanciful or far-fetched claims should not be a basis for initiating federal inquiries.”

Barr’s move prompted the Justice Department official who oversees investigations of voter fraud, Richard Pilger, to resign nearly immediately, our reporters Katie Benner and Michael Schmidt wrote. Pilger told colleagues he would move to a nonsupervisory role working on corruption prosecutions.

In Republican-held state governments across the country, officials have collectively turned toward embracing Trump’s denials of the election result. Ten Republican attorneys general filed an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to hear a dispute over the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s ruling allowing mail-in ballots to be received up to three days after Election Day.

In Georgia, the Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, is under fire from members of his own party — essentially for counting votes. As elections officials have tallied some of the final ballots, Biden’s margin has only grown, and Trump’s campaign has increasingly pressured Raffensperger to stop the counting.

In an extraordinary letter, citing no specific evidence, the two Republican Senate candidates in Georgia, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, argued that Raffensperger had “failed the people of Georgia,” and called on him to step down. He replied at a news conference yesterday afternoon, saying that he wouldn’t resign and that he was just as unhappy as other Republicans about Trump’s loss.

Gabriel Sterling, the secretary of state’s voting system implementation manager, said that the election hadn’t been tainted by irregularities and in fact had run smoother than usual. “The facts are the facts, regardless of outcomes,” he said. “In this state, this time, this election on Election Day was an amazing success.”

Trump has little sway over how Raffensperger runs the election in Georgia, but the president relishes his ability to fire members of his own team. He put that firepower to use again yesterday as he ousted Mark Esper, the defense secretary, announcing abruptly on Twitter that Esper “has been terminated.”

The defense secretary had long appeared to be on the chopping block, especially after publicly breaking with the president over whether to deploy active-duty federal troops against protesters in American cities.

Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois announced yesterday that she would not seek another term as the head of the House Democrats’ campaign arm, acknowledging in a letter to colleagues that she had been “gutted at the losses we sustained.”

While Democrats had expected to build on the sweeping gains they made in 2018, they instead wound up losing seats in the House, while picking up fewer Senate seats than expected and making no major gains in state legislatures.

Accusations have flown throughout the party, with centrist Democrats arguing that the party’s left wing had left them open to being mischaracterized as socialists, while the more progressive incumbents have accused their moderate counterparts of lazy campaigning and ineffective messaging.

Biden announced a 13-member task force yesterday to lead his administration’s effort to confront the coronavirus pandemic, convening the group for a video conference call alongside the vice president-elect, Kamala Harris.

In brief public remarks after their meeting, Biden urged Americans to help contain the virus. “It doesn’t matter your party, your point of view,” he said. “We can save tens of thousands of lives if everyone would just wear a mask for the next few months.”

Biden is moving ahead with planning for Day 1 of his presidency, despite Trump’s efforts to dig his heels into the Oval Office carpet. But there is a range of crucial national security information that Biden still doesn’t have access to; he has yet to receive a daily briefing on national security, as is customary for presidents-elect, and Trump’s refusal to concede could complicate Biden’s access to federal security until his inauguration.

Biden met virtually with members of his coronavirus task force yesterday at the Queen theater in Wilmington, Del.

In the two years that it takes to cover a presidential campaign, Times reporters travel the country in search of stories from everyday Americans that might speak to broader themes. But now that it’s behind us, we asked our reporters to think back on a moment from the campaign that felt out of the ordinary, strange or surprising — something that will stick with them from 2020. Here’s our reporter Nicholas Casey with the first reflection.

I’ve got to say that Dan Parri’s “progressive” Jeep club was one of the strangest sights I came across.

I met Dan at the end of the campaign, at a rally in Pinellas County, Fla., and he told me how he’d stopped riding around town with his club of Jeep enthusiasts after he realized they were mostly voting for Trump.

So he started his own, rival Jeep club for those who liked Biden — and they cruised around Pinellas County very much like the Trumpers did, except with B.L.M. flags, L.G.B.T. flags, American flags and Biden paraphernalia. And lots of balloons.

I say this was only “one of” the strangest things because the very next day I met Cliff Gephart, who showed me around his Trump-themed coffee shop, Conservative Grounds.

If Dan thought people assumed Jeep enthusiasts were all Republicans, what got Cliff worked up was the idea that coffee drinkers were all “latte liberals.” So he outfitted his coffee shop with guns, MAGA hats and a recreation of the Oval Office with a replica of the Resolute desk that he found at a consignment store.

He did that in February, just before the pandemic hit. When the state ordered businesses to shut down, you can imagine how that left him feeling about government intervention.

"Democracy Required Kind of a Lot of Patience, Actually","WILMINGTON, Del. — The teleprompters were set, the patriotic decorations assembled, and onlookers had been waiting for hours. Still, as the light faded behind an oversize American flag and the evening grew chilly, there was no sign of Joseph R. Biden Jr. on the elaborate stage from which his fans hoped he would declare victory.

And so last Friday concluded the way the previous three days had: After hours of anticipation among Mr. Biden’s supporters, a flurry of preparations by his team and mounting Democratic hopes for “Biden beats Trump” headlines, everyone in the vicinity of the Westin hotel in Wilmington, Del., would be left waiting on the result of the presidential campaign, again.

“Democracy is sometimes messy,” Mr. Biden said last week. “It sometimes requires a little patience as well.”

Or, perhaps, a lot of patience. Certainly, some of Mr. Biden’s earliest supporters had been waiting at least since his first presidential bid, in the 1988 campaign, to see him win the White House, so perhaps they were used to it. But not everyone had been standing by for quite so long, and the lurching uncertainty of what turned into an election week was an especially intense and vivid experience for Democratic staff members, Biden friends and family members, as well as journalists who spent much of the last week in Wilmington, near Mr. Biden’s home.

For the second time in three months, international attention turned to this city of around 70,000 along the Delaware River, where the Amtrak station is named for the president-elect and seemingly everyone has a story about running into one member of the Biden clan or another.

Wilmington first readied itself for prime time in the presidential campaign in August. The city hosted the culmination of the largely virtual Democratic National Convention, featuring in-person fireworks and a drive-in rally here after Mr. Biden accepted the nomination, but the event was over as advertised after that.

Last week, the spotlight stretched on as one election night extravaganza turned into four days of waiting before a winner was called.

On the original election night, last Tuesday, longtime Biden fans and neighbors showed up to a drive-in rally hoping to watch him and Senator Kamala Harris declare a landslide victory. They left anxious and edgy as President Trump prevailed in Florida instead, with the presidential race uncalled. Biden staff members who had plainly been expecting a valedictory speech that night were terse with the reporters who chased after them in the subsequent hours.

As the vote count stretched on in key battlegrounds across the country, the days in Wilmington settled into something of a rhythm, much like a day spent waiting in an airport for a long-delayed flight.

In the morning, the Biden team would project confidence and sometimes preview remarks, of some kind, from Mr. Biden. Throughout the day, mask-wearing journalists would scramble after sources who walked through the lobby of the Westin, momentary bursts of physical activity in an environment where leaving the security perimeter even for a sandwich or a mandatory coronavirus test was risky, in case news about a state came in.

Yet if any members of the news media or campaign staff felt nostalgic for the rituals of pre-pandemic political reporting, which often involved waiting around to corner someone in person instead of on a campaign-managed conference call, the bonus days of the election offered glimpses of that era.

At night, everyone waited.

The home base for the festivities was the Chase Center on the Riverfront, an event center near the Christina River — or, more specifically, the parking lot outside, which was transformed into the home of a drive-in gathering on election night, and then a second gathering on Saturday night once the race had been called by news organizations. Inside the center itself, Mr. Biden gave occasional remarks, urging patience and projecting calm even as his aides and donors grew increasingly impatient.

The lobby of the Westin next to the Chase Center became ground zero for spotting Biden aides and allies — an unfamiliar activity, given the virtual nature of the campaign for many months. In Democratic politics, it quickly became the most famous hotel lobby east of the Des Moines Marriott, traditionally an epicenter of political activity before the Iowa caucuses.

Steve Ricchetti, a longtime adviser, whirled through on Friday evening. Anita Dunn, a senior adviser, and Bob Bauer, the former White House counsel, dipped in and out. Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware and a close Biden ally, regularly held impromptu news conferences. Members of Mr. Biden’s team who typically sparred with reporters by phone or on television were swarmed for their latest in-person intel.

The entire area was turned into a fortified compound for election night and the days that followed, with imposing fencing keeping out the public. Outside the security barrier, Biden supporters sat on lawn chairs and at least one father and son slept in a car, hoping to get close enough to glimpse a possible president-elect. The onlookers traded Biden signs and shared doughnuts, and lucked out with unseasonably warm fall weather as the wait stretched on.

There was at least one casualty of election night turning into election week: an enormous American flag that hung from two cranes. After it had ripped and been mended once, it ripped again, and eventually a replacement flag was hoisted in its place.

On Saturday morning, 48 years to the day that Mr. Biden was first elected to the Senate, his sister, Valerie Biden Owens, walked through the Westin lobby.

“It’s wonderful,” she told a small group of reporters as she walked out the door. “It’s a wonderful thing for us, but it’s a better thing for America.”

A few minutes later, CNN called the race for her brother.

On the streets outside the security barrier, drivers leaned on their horns in celebration, passers-by responded with cheers and the smell of cigar smoke wafted.

And inside the Chase Center parking lot, attendees who had waited days to celebrate Mr. Biden at a drive-in rally were ready to display their joy. They waved glow sticks, affixed Biden signs to their cars and, in at least one case, left a Champagne bottle perched on top of a vehicle.

Mr. Biden opened his own remarks — the most important speech of his life — by giving the world an introduction to Delaware politics.

“Delawareans!” he said. “I see my buddy Senator Tom Carper down there, and I think Senator Coons is there, and I think the governor’s around.”

“Is that Ruth Ann?” he asked to cheers, referring to former Gov. Ruth Ann Minner.

At the end of his speech, the sky lit up with another name.

“Biden,” read the lights in the sky, courtesy of a drone light show. “President Elect.”"
Georgia Senators Ask Election Official to Resign in G.O.P. Squabble,"ATLANTA — A rift among Georgia Republicans exploded into public view on Monday as the state’s incumbent senators, both locked in fierce runoff fights for their seats, lashed out at the Republican officials who oversaw last week’s election and leveled unfounded claims of a faulty process lacking in transparency.

The all-out intraparty war erupted as the vote count in Georgia on Monday continued to show President Trump narrowly trailing President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.

Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler of Georgia took the extraordinary step of issuing a joint statement calling for the resignation of the Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, and condemning the election as an “embarrassment.”

“We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out — even when it’s in your own party,” the senators said in their statement, which did not offer any specific allegations or elaborate on how they believed Mr. Raffensperger had fallen short, except to accuse him of “mismanagement and lack of transparency.”

“Honest elections are paramount to the foundation of our democracy,” they added. “The secretary of state has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections. He has failed the people of Georgia, and he should step down immediately.”

Mr. Raffensperger dismissed their allegations as “laughable.”

“Let me start by saying that is not going to happen,” Mr. Raffensperger said of the request to resign.

“I know emotions are running high,” he added. “Politics are involved in everything right now. If I was Senator Perdue, I’d be irritated I was in a runoff. And both senators and I are all unhappy with the potential outcome for our president.”

He argued that his office had been transparent, holding regular briefings and urgently updating vote counts. He asserted that the reporting process had been orderly and lawful, and noted that his office had sent investigators to consider allegations of potential illegal voting. He noted, too, that he had a monitor appointed to oversee elections in Fulton County, home to much of Atlanta, which he called “one of our longtime problem Democrat-run counties.”

The discord has grown as the election results in Georgia, a reliably Republican stronghold in recent years, have unsettled the state and national G.O.P. With nearly all of the ballots counted, Mr. Biden leads Mr. Trump by about 11,400 votes, and Mr. Perdue and Ms. Loeffler were forced into runoff races against Democrats — pivotal elections that could determine control of the Senate.

The joint statement by Mr. Perdue and Ms. Loeffler reflected the divide among Republicans in the state, but also came as many in the party have continued to back Mr. Trump as he falsely insists that the election was stolen from him. On Monday, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said Mr. Trump had “every right to look into allegations and request recounts.”

Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican who was the former top election official before his 2018 election, sought to find middle ground on Monday. While urging Mr. Raffensperger to take seriously any charges of fraud or irregularities surrounding the election, he also did not join in any condemnation of his successor.

“Given the close outcome and the record number of mail-in and absentee ballots cast in this election, this needs to be a wake-up call to the secretary of state’s office to take a serious look at any and all voting irregularity allegations that have been made,” Cody Hall, a spokesman for the governor, said in a statement on Monday. “Georgians deserve to have every legal vote counted in order to have full confidence in the outcome of our elections.”

On Monday morning, Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, who is also a Republican, said on CNN that he had seen no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the state.

“We’ve not had any sort of credible incidents raised to our level yet and so we’ll continue to make sure that the opportunity to make sure every legal ballot is counted is there,” he said.

Some conservatives expressed fear that the volley of accusations impugning the electoral process could depress the vote among Republican voters, who might not turn out for the January runoffs if they did not trust the legitimacy of the electoral process. Some political analysts warned that such attacks could backfire with devastating consequences as the party braces for bitter showdowns between the senators and their opponents.

“Trump is gonna cost the GOP the Senate,” Erick Erickson, a Georgia-based conservative commentator, wrote on Twitter on Sunday. “His supporters are internalizing that the election in Georgia was stolen so why bother even trying.”

With their statement, Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Perdue, who have both long professed their fealty to Mr. Trump, were essentially doubling down on that sentiment, signaling that their campaigns could be more about turning out the conservative base of Trump supporters than repositioning to the political center.

In the Jan. 5 runoffs, Ms. Loeffler will face a challenge from the Rev. Dr. Raphael Warnock, the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta; Mr. Perdue is running against Jon Ossoff, the chief executive of a media production company. None of them received at least 50 percent of the vote in last week’s election.

Mr. Raffensperger, a civil engineer and former state lawmaker, was elected secretary of state in 2018 after receiving a glowing endorsement from Mr. Trump, who said that Mr. Raffensperger would be a “fantastic secretary of state.” Mr. Raffensperger succeeded Mr. Kemp, who was criticized by Democrats in his time as secretary of state for supporting what they described as widespread voter suppression tactics, often in the name of fighting voter fraud.

As a candidate, Mr. Raffensperger also emphasized election security issues, saying he was running “to make sure that only American citizens are voting in our elections.”

“The voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,” Mr. Raffensperger said in his statement on Monday. “As secretary of state, I’ll continue to fight every day to ensure fair elections in Georgia, that every legal vote counts and that illegal votes don’t count.”

In an earlier briefing on Monday, Gabriel Sterling, the voting system implementation manager for Mr. Raffensperger’s office, sought to debunk the various allegations that had circulated and said Election Day had gone smoothly after long lines at times during early voting.

He noted that the average wait time to vote last Tuesday was two minutes.

“The facts are the facts, regardless of outcomes,” he said, adding, “In this state, this time, this election on Election Day was an amazing success.”"
Barr Hands Prosecutors the Authority to Investigate Voter Fraud Claims,"WASHINGTON — Attorney General William P. Barr, wading into President Trump’s unfounded accusations of widespread election irregularities, told federal prosecutors on Monday that they were allowed to investigate “specific allegations” of voter fraud before the results of the presidential race are certified.

Mr. Barr’s authorization prompted the Justice Department official who oversees investigations of voter fraud, Richard Pilger, to step down from the post within hours, according to an email Mr. Pilger sent to colleagues that was obtained by The New York Times.

Mr. Barr said he had authorized “specific instances” of investigative steps in some cases. He made clear in a carefully worded memo that prosecutors had the authority to investigate, but he warned that “specious, speculative, fanciful or far-fetched claims should not be a basis for initiating federal inquiries.”

Mr. Barr’s directive ignored the Justice Department’s longstanding policies intended to keep law enforcement from affecting the outcome of an election. And it followed a move weeks before the election in which the department lifted a prohibition on voter fraud investigations before an election.

“Given that voting in our current elections has now concluded, I authorize you to pursue substantial allegations of voting and vote tabulation irregularities prior to the certification of elections in your jurisdictions,” Mr. Barr wrote.

A Justice Department official said that Mr. Barr had authorized scrutiny of allegations about ineligible voters in Nevada and backdated mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania. Republicans have circulated both claims in recent days without any evidence emerging to back them.

Mr. Barr did not write the memo at the direction of Mr. Trump, the White House or any Republican lawmakers, the official said.

Mr. Barr has privately told department officials in the days since the election that any disputes should be resolved in court by the campaigns themselves, according to three people briefed on the conversations. He has said that he did not see massive fraud, and that most of the allegations of voter fraud were related to individual instances that did not point to a larger systemic problem, the people said.

But critics of Mr. Barr immediately condemned the memo as a political act that undermined the Justice Department’s typical independence from the White House.

“It would be problematic enough if Barr were reversing longstanding Justice Department guidance because of significant, substantiated claims of misconduct — that could presumably be handled at the local and state level,” said Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law.

“But to do so when there is no such evidence — and when the president’s clear strategy is to delegitimize the results of a proper election — is one of the more problematic acts of any attorney general in my lifetime,” Mr. Vladeck added.

Mr. Pilger, a career prosecutor in the department’s Public Integrity Section who oversaw voting-fraud-related investigations, told colleagues he would move to a nonsupervisory role working on corruption prosecutions.

“Having familiarized myself with the new policy and its ramifications,” he wrote, “I must regretfully resign from my role as director of the Election Crimes Branch.” A Justice Department spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Mr. Pilger’s message.

Justice Department policies prohibit federal prosecutors from taking overt steps, like questioning witnesses or securing subpoenas for documents, to open a criminal investigation into any election-related matter until after voting results have been certified to keep their existence from spilling into public view and influencing either voters or local election officials who ensure the integrity of the results.

“Public knowledge of a criminal investigation could impact the adjudication of election litigation and contests in state courts,” the Justice Department’s longstanding election guidelines for prosecutors say. “Accordingly, it is the general policy of the department not to conduct overt investigations.”

More covert investigative steps, like an investigator going undercover, are allowed but require the permission of a career prosecutor in the department’s Criminal Division.

Mr. Barr’s memo allows U.S. attorneys to bypass that career prosecutor and take their requests to his office for approval, effectively weakening a key safeguard that prevents political interference in an election by the party in power.

The memo is unlikely to change the outcome of the election but could damage public confidence in the results, Justice Department prosecutors warned, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. They said that the public posturing by the department also gave Republicans, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, a tool to refuse to acknowledge Mr. Biden as the president-elect.

Mr. McConnell and Mr. Barr met on Monday afternoon. Representatives from both of their offices declined to comment on what they discussed.

Mr. Trump faces a steep battle in his attempt to change the election results. Mr. Biden declared victory on Saturday after several news media organizations declared him the winner based on tabulated election returns.

“It’s not merely about showing evidence of fraud but that the malfeasance would actually affect the outcome in several states,” said Matt Gorman, a Republican strategist. “You’re talking about changing hundreds of thousands of votes.”

While Mr. Trump’s campaign lawyers have filed a dozen or so legal challenges to the results in battleground states, none appeared to be gaining traction in the courts. And none were likely to give the president an edge in the votes he would need to change the outcome of the race.

Justice Department investigators are looking into a referral from the Republican Party in Nevada, which claims over 3,000 people who live outside the state voted in its election, the department official said. The official would not say whether the department had opened a full investigation. A federal judge dismissed the claim in court last week.

The department is also reviewing a sworn affidavit written by a postal worker in Erie, Pa., alleging that post office officials devised a plan to backdate mail ballots in the state, the official said.

The local postmaster has denied the allegations and said that the accuser has been disciplined multiple times in the past. That affidavit was sent to the department by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who is a close ally of the president.

In the days after the election, Mr. Barr faced pressure from Mr. Trump and his aides to intervene to help the president. Conservative commentators have criticized Mr. Barr’s lack of action, saying that he was looking the other way.

Mr. Barr had been silent about voter fraud in recent weeks after previously issuing unsubstantiated warnings of widespread fraud because of the large number of mail-in ballots cast in this election. Voter fraud is rare, and no major instances of it have emerged in the election.

At the same time, the department has made it easier for prosecutors to pursue voter fraud cases and publicized details from the investigations that generated headlines that helped Mr. Trump, prompting sharp criticism from Democrats and civil rights advocates.

Biden Moves to Confront a Pandemic Racing Out of Control,"WASHINGTON — President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. moved on Monday to begin assuming responsibility for the surging coronavirus pandemic, naming a string of high-profile scientists — including a former surgeon general and a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner — to advise him on the pandemic and imploring Americans to wear masks.

“A mask is not a political statement, but it’s a good way to start pulling the country together,” Mr. Biden declared in a brief speech from his home city, Wilmington, Del., after meeting with members of his new coronavirus advisory board.

Mr. Biden’s moves were reminiscent of former President Barack Obama’s quick steps after his election in November 2008 to name an economics team as the nation spiraled further into financial crisis. The situation Mr. Biden will inherit will be even more dire: a deadly pandemic wrapped inside a devastating economic downturn, against the backdrop of a deeply divided nation and President Trump’s refusal to accept the election results.

Mr. Biden’s new advisory panel offered a not-so-subtle rebuke of Mr. Trump: Its members include Rick Bright, a vaccine expert who blew the whistle on the Trump administration this spring after he was abruptly removed from his job running a federal medical research agency.

“I am grateful for the opportunity to serve my country & rejoin the fight against COVID-19,” Dr. Bright wrote Monday on Twitter. “With the leadership of President-elect Biden & VP-elect Harris, & their trust in Science, I have no doubt we’ll be able to end the pandemic & save lives. And remember, #WearAMask!”

More than 238,000 Americans have died of Covid-19, and if current trends hold, the number of deaths could double by the time Mr. Biden takes office in January. On Sunday, the United States reached a grim milestone: 10 million Americans have now been infected. Mr. Biden himself has repeatedly warned of a “dark winter” — a phrase he invoked again on Monday, saying, “We’re still facing a very dark winter.”

Mr. Biden’s appearance in Wilmington underscored a difficult truth for the president-elect: While he has vowed to make fighting the pandemic his No. 1 priority as president, he can do little before he is inaugurated Jan. 20 other than use his bully pulpit.

“What he knows is there is almost 10 weeks between now and the inauguration, and those 10 weeks are absolutely critical for the health of this country,” said Kathleen Sebelius, who served as health secretary to Mr. Obama and has advised the Biden team.

Mr. Biden campaigned on a promise of an aggressive federal response to Covid-19 — in contrast with Mr. Trump’s leave-it-to-the states approach. His plan includes appointing a “national supply chain commander” and setting up a “pandemic response board” — ideas that draw heavily from President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose big-government policies helped lift the nation out of the Great Depression.

“There’s a need for bold action to fight this pandemic,” Mr. Biden said on Monday. In making his case for wearing masks, he gave a nod to Roosevelt’s wartime stance, saying, “Throughout our history, the history of our nation, we have seen over and over again how small acts add up to enormous achievements.”

The 13 members of his task force include well-known figures with Washington experience, some of whom are familiar faces on television: Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, a former surgeon general; Dr. David A. Kessler, a former F.D.A. commissioner; Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, a noted bioethicist and brother of former Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago; and Dr. Atul Gawande, a best-selling author.

Mr. Biden reached across parties and across administrations. Dr. Luciana Borio, a vice president at In-Q-Tel, which invests in intelligence technology, was a member of Mr. Trump’s National Security Council until he disbanded the office charged with responding to pandemics and bioterrorism threats. Dr. Michael T. Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, advised the George W. Bush administration after the 2001 anthrax attacks.

None of the task force members appeared with him on Monday, but Ms. Sebelius said Mr. Biden “is signaling that science is back.”

The panel will have three co-chairmen: Dr. Murthy and Dr. Kessler, who have been advising the Biden campaign since March, and Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, an associate professor at the Yale School of Medicine. All have activist bents.

Dr. Murthy, a son of Indian immigrants who were also physicians, served as surgeon general under Mr. Obama, and briefly under Mr. Trump, who fired Dr. Murthy in April 2017 when he refused to step down.

The first surgeon general of Indian descent, he has for years made headlines for calling gun violence a public health threat; the National Rifle Association urged the Senate not to confirm him.

Dr. Kessler, who led the F.D.A. under Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton, made his name in Washington in the 1990s fighting Big Tobacco.

A Harvard-educated pediatrician who also has a law degree from the University of Chicago, he led the F.D.A. in an unsuccessful push to regulate cigarettes, and steered the agency as it sped up drug approvals and enacted regulations requiring food manufacturers to use standardized nutrition labels and expose “stealth fat” in foods.

Dr. Nunez-Smith, who was raised in St. Thomas, one of the U.S. Virgin Islands, has devoted her career to ending racial disparities in health — a perspective that will inform her work on the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately affected people of color.

At Yale, she is the founding director of a research center devoted to creating health equity for marginalized populations, and is also the founding director of the Pozen-Commonwealth Fund Fellowship in Health Equity Leadership, which trains health care professionals to address disparities in health and medical care.

“Covid-19 is about a virus, but also inequities in health that pre-existed the pandemic,” said Gregg Gonsalves, an assistant professor at the Yale School of Public Health. “Dr. Nunez-Smith has spent her life and career focused on those left behind, forgotten and hit hard” by the coronavirus.

The panel will also include Dr. Eric Goosby, an internationally recognized infectious disease expert who was Mr. Obama’s global AIDS coordinator; Dr. Celine Gounder, a clinical assistant professor at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine; Dr. Julie Morita, the executive vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a philanthropy focused on health; Loyce Pace, the executive director and president of Global Health Council; and Dr. Robert Rodriguez, who like Dr. Goosby teaches at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine.

Mr. Biden has also vowed to consult Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert. Dr. Fauci, who tries to stay out of politics, did not respond to a text message on Monday asking if Mr. Biden had reached out to him, and refused to answer a question about it during an interview with Wolf Blitzer of CNN. But he offered praise for the vice president’s advisers.

“They’re colleagues of mine, they’re people that I’ve been dealing with for years and years,” he said. “Of course they’re qualified.”

"Where the ‘Blue Wall’ Was Strongest, and Where Cracks Appeared","President Trump’s path to re-election always had very little margin for error. His victory in 2016 was decided by just 77,000 votes spread across three Northern battleground states, fewer than the crowd at an average Big Ten football game on a Saturday, at least before the pandemic.

Since the start of his campaign in early 2019, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has made the case that he could beat Mr. Trump precisely because of the strength he would have in those states — Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — where his unpretentious, approachable style and moderate politics would connect with voters.

On Election Day, Mr. Biden’s analysis prevailed. He won every state. Here is a look at the dynamics that worked in his favor.

The antipathy toward Mr. Trump in many swing and Republican-leaning suburbs was a national phenomenon, and in the communities surrounding Detroit it provided Mr. Biden with the votes he needed to help claw the state back from the president.

Victory was always going to be difficult for Mr. Trump in Michigan, a state he won by less than 11,000 votes in 2016. But he traveled there often in the final days of the race, believing it was within reach. The Republican National Committee, whose chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, lives in Michigan, dropped money on a last-minute ad campaign in the hope of moving the needle in the president’s favor.

In the end, Mr. Trump held onto most of the counties he won in 2016 and boosted his vote total statewide by nearly 370,000, with gains in places like Macomb County, a bellwether that first appeared in the political spotlight in the 1980s, thanks to its high concentration of Reagan Democrats. But it was not enough. He grew his base, but often in smaller, rural counties where there weren’t a lot of votes to begin with. And even in places where he gained significantly, like Macomb, Mr. Biden’s gains were bigger when measured against Hillary Clinton’s totals in 2016.

Mr. Biden surged ahead of Mrs. Clinton’s statewide, especially in suburban areas where Republicans were once dominant. He managed to flip conservative-leaning Kent County in the western part of the state, the home of former President Gerald R. Ford. In Oakland County, the state’s second-largest, Mr. Biden finished ahead of Mr. Trump by 14 points, a major improvement over not just Mrs. Clinton but also Barack Obama in 2008, who both won it by eight points. Mr. Biden managed to do very well in the county’s wealthy enclaves like Bloomfield Hills, where Mitt Romney grew up and where being a Democrat was, until recently, one of the surest impediments to getting elected at any level of government.

As was the case in many suburban areas across the Midwestern battlegrounds, women voters were especially activated in Oakland County.

One place that was not especially helpful to the president-elect was the city of Detroit. A lack of enthusiasm there for Mrs. Clinton helped sink her chances of winning the state, but this year Democrats had high hopes that turnout in the predominantly African-American city would rebound. It did, but for Mr. Trump. Though Mr. Biden won Detroit with 94 percent of the vote, he received almost 1,000 fewer votes than Mrs. Clinton did in 2016. Mr. Trump increased his totals by nearly 5,000 votes, with strength concentrated in small pockets of the city like the west side, which has a large number of Latino voters.

The trends in the state that put Mr. Biden over the top in the Electoral College were similar to those in Michigan. Its biggest city, Philadelphia, went overwhelmingly to the president-elect, but also provided Mr. Trump with more votes than he received four years ago.

Though votes were still trickling in nearly a week after Election Day, Mr. Biden was behind where Mrs. Clinton finished in Philadelphia. And Mr. Trump saw an uptick in his numbers in white working-class neighborhoods in the city’s northeast, as well as in precincts with large Latino populations.

Outside of Philadelphia, it was a different story. Mr. Biden’s voters showed up in overwhelming numbers in the suburbs and swing counties farther out, like Northampton in the Lehigh Valley and Erie in the northwest. These predominantly white counties voted twice for Mr. Obama, then went to Mr. Trump in 2016.

Mr. Biden won them both, but narrowly — Erie County by one percentage point and Northampton County by less than a point. Northampton, with its mix of rural areas, old mining towns and small to medium-size cities like Bethlehem, behaved like other demographically similar areas where Mr. Trump’s leadership style drove voters away and energized the opposition against him.

Erie County does not have as high an average income as Northampton, but it has about the same majority percentage of white voters, spread across rural areas and small cities. It was the kind of place where Mr. Biden’s back story, rooted in the working-class city of Scranton, about five hours east, seems to have made Trump voters comfortable switching sides. While Mr. Trump increased his vote totals in Erie County by roughly 5,000, Mr. Biden outdid him. He improved on Mrs. Clinton’s performance by more than 9,000 votes to pull just barely ahead, proving again that in places where the Trump campaign was effective at mobilizing its base, it could not keep pace.

For much of the campaign, Mr. Trump’s re-election seemed to hinge on Wisconsin. It was the test market for his playbook of driving up turnout in rural areas where his operation could identify people who liked him but who didn’t vote in 2016. The playbook worked, but the margins were too small: a few thousand votes, give or take, in most of the state’s 72 counties.

Mr. Biden didn’t flip any major counties, just two smaller ones north of Milwaukee. But in a sign of the president’s weakness among voters 65 and older, one of those was Door County, northeast of Green Bay on Lake Michigan. As a destination popular with retirees but also reliant on tourism, Door County was an especially bad environment for the president, considering the many voters who blamed him for mismanaging the deadly coronavirus and the economic fallout that followed.

In the bigger picture, Wisconsin’s shifts toward Mr. Biden came from its cities and largest counties. Well-educated, prosperous counties like Dane, home to the liberal university town of Madison, saw a significant jump in turnout over 2016 that went almost entirely to Mr. Biden. In the conservative counties surrounding Milwaukee that are a bulwark of support for Republicans running statewide, Mr. Trump’s share of the vote declined. The drop off wasn’t huge, but it helped Mr. Biden build his 20,000-vote lead in Wisconsin.

In the city of Milwaukee, the dynamic was once again similar to the ones seen in Detroit and Philadelphia: Mr. Biden won an overwhelming share of the city but did not improve much over Mrs. Clinton. And in wards of the city with majority Black populations, fewer voters cast their votes for him than they did for her, according to The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Mr. Biden also appeared to do worse against Mr. Trump in city wards with a large number of Latino voters."
When Will Joe Biden Be Sworn In?,"Joseph R. Biden Jr. is expected to be sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on Jan. 20 at an outdoor inauguration ceremony, though the coronavirus pandemic might cause the plans to be scaled back.

“We are moving forward, anticipating an outside, full-scale inauguration,” Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, said on Sunday on the ABC News program “This Week With George Stephanopoulos.”

But Mr. Blunt, who chairs the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, was still hedging about which candidate he expected to be placing his hand upon a Bible that day.

“This is a great time for us to show how a true democracy works,” Mr. Blunt said, adding: “I’m confident we are going to see that. I expect to see both Vice President Biden and President Trump on the stage on Inaugural Day, and that will be a powerful message, no matter which one of them is sworn in.”

Before Mr. Biden takes the oath of office, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, the first woman elected as vice president, will be sworn in that day from the West Front of the U.S. Capitol in Washington. They have not yet said whom they prefer to administer their oaths.

Here are more details about the state of inauguration planning.

Since 1901, the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies has organized the inaugural ceremonies of the president-elect and the vice-president elect.

The current six-member committee began planning for the 2021 inauguration in June, when the group selected a site and approved a $1.5 million budget. The members, besides Mr. Blunt, are the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell; Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota; Speaker Nancy Pelosi; and the majority and minority leaders of the House, Steny H. Hoyer and Kevin McCarthy.

The theme for the nation’s 59th inauguration will be “Our Determined Democracy: Forging a More Perfect Union,” Mr. Blunt said.

American officials and other dignitaries are expected to gather at the inaugural platform, which is over 10,000 square feet and holds more than 1,600 people for the swearing-in ceremonies.

Traditionally, the group that is seated on the platform includes the president and vice president and their families; the president-elect and vice president-elect and their families; the chief justice and associate justices of the Supreme Court; former presidents; the diplomatic corps; cabinet members and nominees; members of Congress; governors; the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and other guests, according to the joint committee.

In 2017, when Mr. Trump was sworn in, his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, were in attendance, as were Mr. Trump’s predecessor, former President Barack Obama, and his wife, Michelle Obama, and former Presidents George W. Bush and Jimmy Carter. President George H.W. Bush was unable to attend because of poor health; he died in 2018.

Every president since George Washington has delivered the Inaugural Address, which has ranged from 8,445 words to 135 words, according to the committee. During his Inaugural Address on Jan. 20, 2017, Mr. Trump spoke for 16 minutes before hundreds of thousands of followers and spectators. In his speech, he vowed to shatter the established order and reverse a national decline that he called “this American carnage.”

The next day, Mr. Trump disputed independent estimates of the attendance, saying that up to 1.5 million people had been there, a claim disproved by photographs. Visual estimates of the size of the crowd put it at one-third the size of Mr. Obama’s first inauguration in 2009.

No. The ratification of the 20th Amendment in 1933 fixed Jan. 20 as the date. Before that, inaugurations traditionally took place on March 4. Through history, the ceremony has taken place on other dates and in 10 different locations.

Washington, the nation’s first president, was sworn in on April 30, 1789, at Federal Hall in New York City.

Andrew Jackson’s first inauguration, on March 4, 1829, was the first ceremony to be conducted on the East Portico of the Capitol. The crowds of attendees were so excited that they rushed toward the new president, who then retreated into the Capitol and rode a horse to the White House.

On Nov. 22, 1963, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson swiftly took the oath of office in a conference room aboard Air Force One in Dallas after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

It has not yet been announced who will perform at the inauguration. Certain programming elements are decided by the committee, and others are decided by the president-elect.

At Mr. Trump’s inauguration, performers included the Missouri State University Chorale, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Jackie Evancho, a teenage soprano who closed out the ceremony by singing “The Star-Spangled Banner.”

For President Obama’s second inauguration, in 2013, performers included the first “American Idol” winner, Kelly Clarkson, who sang “My Country, ’Tis of Thee.” The poet Richard Blanco read his inaugural poem, “One Today.”"
An Obama Restoration on Foreign Policy? Familiar Faces Could Fill Biden’s Team,"WASHINGTON — President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s national security team is likely to be largely staffed by former Obama Situation Room regulars prepared to restore foreign policy principles discarded by President Trump.

An Obama redux would be a source of enormous relief to establishment insiders, who are desperate to see seasoned hands regain control of national security. But that likelihood is also causing disquiet among some younger, more liberal Democrats impatient with their party’s pre-Trump national security instincts, which they consider badly outdated.

It is of course Mr. Biden who will direct policy: As a former vice president and Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, he needs expert foreign policy advice far less than his recent predecessors. But he will also be consumed in his early months by the coronavirus and his economic agenda, potentially giving his top appointees unusual influence.

They are almost certain to include Antony Blinken, a deputy secretary of state and deputy national security adviser under Mr. Obama who previously worked for Mr. Biden in the Senate; Avril Haines, a deputy at Mr. Obama’s Central Intelligence Agency and on his National Security Council; Susan E. Rice, Mr. Obama’s last national security adviser; and Michèle Flournoy, the Pentagon’s top policy official under Mr. Obama.

“I think virtually everybody who gets named will have served under Obama,” said James Mann, the author of books about foreign policy advisers to Mr. Obama and former President George W. Bush.

While their collective résumés are impeccable by the standards of the Council on Foreign Relations, some party insiders and analysts say Mr. Biden’s team-in-waiting may be too cautious and conventionally minded at a moment when party insurgents and activists are challenging Democratic orthodoxy on subjects like Israel, military spending and counterterrorism operations in the Middle East and North Africa.

To some they are representative of what Mr. Obama’s former deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes famously derided as “The Blob” — a Washington foreign policy establishment too confident in American hegemony and too willing to resort to force.

They also grumble about their corporate connections, noting that Mr. Blinken and Ms. Flournoy in 2017 founded the Washington consulting firm WestExec, whose slogan has been “Bringing the Situation Room to the Board Room.” Its roster of current and former employees is a who’s-who of likely Biden appointees that includes Ms. Haines, a former principal.

“They’re bringing in the usual suspects. There are no new faces here,” said John Mearsheimer, a political-science professor at the University of Chicago and a frequent critic of Washington’s foreign policy elites. “And to the extent there are new faces and younger people, they sound just like the usual suspects.”

Most of the people around Mr. Biden represent a risk-averse, center-left approach to foreign policy, Mr. Mearsheimer said, one that envisions a more active role for American economic, diplomatic and, in some cases, military power than many rank-and-file Democrats favor.

Mr. Biden’s early national security appointments are likely to contrast with those of Mr. Obama, who took office after just a few years in Washington and with only a handful of foreign policy aides under his wing. For his national security adviser, Mr. Obama chose a retired Marine general, James L. Jones, whom he had met just once. The relationship never took and Mr. Jones was gone in less than two years.

But Mr. Biden will be surrounded by very familiar faces, beginning with Mr. Blinken, 58, an aide who has worked for him since 2002, when he became the staff director on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when Mr. Biden was the chairman. Mr. Blinken, a wavy-haired rock and jazz aficionado with smooth mannerisms in the classic diplomatic style, may aspire to become the secretary of state, though some predict Mr. Biden will want his confidant in the West Wing as the national security adviser.

Another top candidate to head the State Department has been Ms. Rice, with whom Mr. Biden spent countless hours in the Situation Room and nearly chose to be his running mate.

But her prospects look dimmer now that Republicans may retain control of the Senate. Ms. Rice has been a special target of congressional Republicans, accused of dishonestly downplaying terrorism as the motive for the deadly 2012 attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, when she was the ambassador to the United Nations. Their obsession with the episode — which some allies of Ms. Rice attribute to sexism and racism — persuaded Mr. Obama in 2013 to name her national security adviser, a job that does not require Senate confirmation, and not secretary of state as he had originally planned.

An alternative is Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a close ally of Mr. Biden who holds his former Senate seat and has been an active member of the Foreign Relations Committee. In temperament and ideology, Mr. Coons, a Democrat, is a relative moderate respected by his Republican colleagues and might be far easier to confirm.

Mr. Biden could also choose from a handful of career diplomats who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, bringing them bipartisan credibility. They include Bill Burns, a longtime senior State Department official who served as deputy secretary of state under Mr. Obama and now heads the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and Nicholas Burns (no relation), another former longtime diplomat who held top posts in the Bush administration. Both men could be in line for other senior diplomatic jobs like ambassadorships.

Ms. Haines is a likely choice to run the C.I.A. Some progressives complain that she was not a more active critic of the agency’s torture practices during the Bush era, but Obama officials say she supported reining in drone strikes against terrorists that were causing civilian casualties. Ms. Haines understands the agency without being a captive to its views, according to one of her admirers from the Obama White House. An alternative would be Michael Morell, a former deputy and acting C.I.A. director.

Ms. Flournoy is the expected choice to run the Pentagon. Respected by Republicans, she would most likely encounter little confirmation resistance. But Mr. Biden may prefer someone with more political experience than the cerebral military strategist — particularly given potential battles with liberals who will demand big defense cuts that Ms. Flournoy would probably resist.

Another contender for defense secretary or attorney general is Jeh C. Johnson, a former general counsel at the Defense Department who as homeland security secretary under Mr. Obama has run a cabinet department before. His old job could go to Lisa Monaco, who helped Mr. Biden vet his potential running mates during the campaign.

Ambassador to the United Nations has often been a steppingstone for promising or rising figures, someone like Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., who is said to be interested in the post and did not serve in the Obama administration. Though he has never practiced diplomacy, the multilingual Mr. Buttigieg served as a Navy officer in Afghanistan and spoke in more depth about foreign policy than most of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.

Other senior posts are likely to go to Brian McKeon, who first worked for Mr. Biden when he was a senator in the 1980s and held a senior Pentagon role in the Obama administration, and Carlyn Reichel, who wrote foreign policy speeches for him when he was vice president and who coordinated his outside foreign policy advisers during the campaign.

Mr. Obama’s second national security adviser, Tom Donilon, has known Mr. Biden since the 1980s and served as an adviser to his campaign. He has emerged as a China specialist, and one former Obama official wondered whether he might become the ambassador to Beijing or possibly assume a senior intelligence role. Some believe Mr. Donilon, whose brother Mike is Mr. Biden’s chief political strategist, would welcome being secretary of state.

John Kerry, Mr. Obama’s second secretary of state, was a Senate contemporary of Mr. Biden, campaigned for him during the primaries and, even at age 76, is assumed to retain his inexhaustible hunger for the political fray. Some admirers envision him as a potential climate czar — global warming has become his signature cause — or perhaps a special envoy to some foreign trouble spot.

One big question is what will become of Jake Sullivan, who was Mr. Biden’s national security adviser before becoming an aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Long spoken of as a future national security adviser, Mr. Sullivan has a foreign policy background but has been coordinating domestic issues for the campaign since the March coronavirus outbreak. If he does not move into a domestically oriented job, Mr. Sullivan, 43, would be a natural for a senior national security post.

"Republicans Back Trump’s Refusal to Concede, Declining to Recognize Biden","Leading Republicans rallied on Monday around President Trump’s refusal to concede the election, declining to challenge the false narrative that it was stolen from him or to recognize President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory even as party divisions burst into public view.

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the top Republican in Congress, threw his support behind Mr. Trump in a sharply worded speech on the Senate floor. He declared that Mr. Trump was “100 percent within his rights” to turn to the legal system to challenge the outcome and hammered Democrats for expecting the president to concede.

In his first public remarks since Mr. Biden was declared the winner, Mr. McConnell celebrated the success of Republicans who won election to the House and the Senate. But in the next breath, he treated the outcome of the presidential election — based on the same ballots that elected those Republicans — as unknown.

“President Trump is 100 percent within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,” said Mr. McConnell, the majority leader. “Let’s not have any lectures about how the president should immediately, cheerfully accept preliminary election results from the same characters who just spent four years refusing to accept the validity of the last election.”

In Georgia, where the continuing vote count showed Mr. Trump losing the state’s electoral votes, Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler — both Republicans now facing January runoffs to keep their seats — took the extraordinary step of calling on the state’s top election official to resign. Declaring Georgia’s handling of the election an “embarrassment” and citing vague “failures” in an echo of Mr. Trump’s evidence-free charges of stolen votes, they said Brad Raffensperger, the Republican secretary of state, had failed the state.

Mr. Raffensperger bluntly rejected their calls, declaring the senators’ claims “laughable” and suggesting that they were merely disgruntled because Mr. Trump might lose and their jobs were on the line.

The intraparty feuding underscored how political considerations around Georgia, whose two Senate contests will most likely decide control of the chamber two weeks before Inauguration Day, are driving Republicans’ calculations about how to handle the election results. Republican leaders are reluctant to make any move that might alienate Mr. Trump’s loyal supporters and hurt their candidates’ chances. That includes appearing to bow to the reality that he has lost before the president himself is ready to do so.

There was little sign on Monday that would happen in the near term. Mr. Trump’s team rolled out its latest legal moves to challenge the outcome in key states. And in Washington, Emily W. Murphy, a Trump political appointee and administrator of the General Services Administration, refused to formally recognize Mr. Biden as the president-elect with a letter of “ascertainment,” leaving the country’s transition of power in flux.

Unperturbed, Mr. Biden plunged ahead with a transition operation that was quickly getting off the ground. In Wilmington, Del., he announced the creation of a Covid-19 advisory board and made an urgent plea to Americans to wear face masks to slow the spread of the coronavirus. He fielded a call from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, as a legion of advisers worked quickly to begin lining up candidates to fill top agency posts.

“It doesn’t matter who you voted for, where you stood before Election Day,” Mr. Biden said after meeting with the advisory board. “It doesn’t matter your party, your point of view. We can save tens of thousands of lives if everyone would just wear a mask for the next few months.”

On Capitol Hill, even as many Republicans privately conceded that the president’s claims were outlandish and mostly avoided repeating them, their public statements suggested that they had no intention of forcing Mr. Trump to accept defeat and begin preparing to hand over the reins of power.

They appeared intent on standing by him for a variety of reasons, hoping that the legal process might lend more authority to the final result or that Mr. Trump might simply give in without an intraparty fight.

“I think the election is not over until the votes are counted and the legal challenges are decided,” Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of the president who was re-elected to his South Carolina seat, told reporters. “That’s why I would encourage the president not to concede.”

Only a small group of independent-minded Republicans who have records of breaking with Mr. Trump said they had seen enough.

Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate who last week resoundingly won re-election in a state that Mr. Trump lost, congratulated Mr. Biden as the president-elect and stressed the need to begin a transition. Still, even she said that Mr. Trump should be given an opportunity to challenge the results and urged Americans to be patient.

“I know that many are eager to have certainty right now,” Ms. Collins said. “While we have a clear direction, we should continue to respect that process.”

Mr. Trump and his allies intensified their baseless claims that fraud had wrongly tilted the election in Mr. Biden’s favor, filing a new lawsuit challenging the results in select counties where Mr. Biden won in Pennsylvania.

The filing was preceded by a combative press briefing in which the president’s press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, and the Republican National Committee chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, alleged that the state election was improperly conducted.

But much of the event included rehashed versions of the arguments Mr. Trump’s team has been making for days, including the false accusation that Democratic-leaning election officials had barred Republican observers from critical counting rooms.

At one point, Fox News cut away from the briefing, with the host Neil Cavuto telling his audience, “I can’t in good countenance keep showing you this,” as he noted that Ms. McEnany had not presented any evidence for her charges of Democratic rigging.

Earlier, a Michigan court rejected a Trump campaign filing challenging the results in the state, calling the motion “defective” because it lacked several requisite pieces of information, including any evidence.

Yet on Capitol Hill, Mr. McConnell and many other Republicans were keeping alive the possibility that Mr. Trump might have legitimate claims. Their approaches were consistent with the way Republicans in Congress have handled Mr. Trump for the last four years, declining to explicitly challenge or contradict the president’s false claims, without necessarily echoing them either.

Rather than openly rebuke the false assertion that the election was stolen, Mr. McConnell instead said that “this process will reach its resolution.”

“Our system will resolve any recounts or litigation,” he said.

But he also took the opportunity to torch Democrats, saying they had no right to expect that Mr. Trump would quickly concede.

“At this time last week, small-business owners in cities across America were boarding up their windows in case President Trump appeared to win and far-left mobs decided to reprise their summertime rioting,” Mr. McConnell said. “Suffice to say, a few legal inquiries from the president do not exactly spell the end of the republic.”

Democrats were outraged. Following Mr. McConnell on the floor, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said flatly that “Joe Biden won this election fair and square.” He called Mr. Trump’s claims “extremely dangerous, extremely poisonous to our democracy” and warned Republican leaders not to give them oxygen.

“Republican leaders must unequivocally condemn the president’s rhetoric and work to ensure the peaceful transfer of power,” Mr. Schumer said.

A group of 30 former Republican lawmakers, including former Representatives Carlos Curbelo of Florida, Barbara Comstock of Virginia, Tom Coleman of Missouri and Bob Inglis of South Carolina, joined a letter calling on Mr. Trump to concede and accept the results of the election.

“We believe the statements by President Trump alleging fraud in the election are efforts to undermine the legitimacy of the election and are unacceptable,” the group wrote. “Every vote should be counted and the final outcome accepted by the participants because public confidence in the outcome of our elections is a bedrock of our democracy.”

Few elected Republicans have voiced such views, or even offered the traditional recognition of Mr. Biden’s victory and called for the country to move forward. In her statement Monday, Ms. Collins joined just a handful of House Republicans and just three other Senate Republicans — Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Ben Sasse of Nebraska — in publicly doing so.

“He loves this country, and I wish him every success,” Ms. Collins said in a statement. “Presidential transitions are important, and the president-elect and the vice president-elect should be given every opportunity to ensure that they are ready to govern on Jan. 20.”

Other Republicans focused instead on defending what they described as Mr. Trump’s right to pursue legal avenues, although some gently suggested that the time had come for his campaign to substantiate its claims. Pressed on Monday, senators pointed to the 2000 election — whose outcome remained uncertain as a prolonged legal fight reached the Supreme Court — as precedent for withholding a concession as court challenges moved forward. They argued that voters, not the press, decide the election outcome.

“There is a process that is available, and I don’t begrudge the president for availing himself of that process,” Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, told reporters on Capitol Hill. “But in the end, they’re going to have to come up with some facts and evidence. But that’s not my job — that’s his campaign’s job.”

Trump Appointee Stands Between Biden’s Team and a Smooth Transition,"Transition officials for President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. called on a top Trump administration appointee on Monday to end what they said was unwarranted obstruction of the money and access that federal law says must flow to the winner of a presidential election.

The officials, speaking on background to reporters on Monday night, said it was nearly unprecedented for Emily W. Murphy, the administrator of the General Services Administration, to refuse to issue a letter of “ascertainment,” which allows Mr. Biden’s transition team to begin the transfer of power.

By law, Ms. Murphy, the head of the sprawling agency that keeps the federal government functioning, must formally recognize Mr. Biden as the incoming president for his transition to begin. It has been three days since news organizations projected that he was the winner of the election, and Ms. Murphy has still not acted.

The transition officials said her inaction was preventing Mr. Biden’s teams from moving into government offices, including secure facilities where they can discuss classified information. The teams cannot meet with their counterparts in agencies or begin background checks of top cabinet nominees that require top-secret access.

A White House official pointed out, as several Trump allies have, that the transition after the 2000 presidential election was delayed by the court fight between the campaigns of Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas over several weeks. The official said it would be strange for President Trump to send some kind of a signal to allow the transition to start while he is still engaged in court fights.

But Mr. Biden’s aides said that the dispute in 2000 involved one state with only about 500 ballots separating the winner and loser, far less than in the current contest. In every other presidential race for the past 60 years, the determination of a winner was made within 24 hours, they said — even as legal challenges and recounts continued for weeks.

They said that they were considering “all options,” including potential legal action, to push Ms. Murphy to let the transition begin.

Ms. Murphy, who described herself as “a bit of a wonk” at her Senate confirmation hearing in October 2017, and also said that she was “not here to garner headlines or make a name for myself,” so far has chosen to side with the White House and Mr. Trump, standing between Mr. Biden’s team and a smooth transition.

The president refuses to concede the election and has his campaign contesting results in multiple states. Most Republicans have declined to recognize Mr. Biden, much less appointees like Ms. Murphy. And so the transfer of power that must take place is in limbo.

A White House spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a question about whether Mr. Trump was willing to let Ms. Murphy begin the transition without a concession from the president, as his court fights play out.

Leslie Dach, who was to lead the transition for the Department of Health and Human Services had Hillary Clinton won the presidency in 2016, said that despite the advance work done by Mr. Biden’s team during the campaign, nothing could supplant having direct access to agencies, and that is impossible without Ms. Murphy.

“I think this is Trump sending a clear signal to everybody still standing in the administration that you’ve got to still follow his grievances,” Mr. Dach said.

The stalling of the transition is part of an overarching refusal to acknowledge the election results by the Trump administration.

Officials in the White House presidential personnel office, known as P.P.O., have signaled that they will fire political appointees who search for new jobs outside of the administration during this time, according to two people briefed on the internal discussions. And on a call with U.S.A.I.D. staff members on Monday, officials described the election as still happening, according to a recording obtained by Axios.

In a letter on Sunday from the nonpartisan Center for Presidential Transition, veterans of previous administrations warned, “While there will be legal disputes requiring adjudication, the outcome is sufficiently clear that the transition process must now begin.”

Aides to Mr. Biden have been working for months to develop fine-tuned transition plans to help the president-elect quickly make good on his campaign promises. Those review teams made up of people knowledgeable about each federal agency are critical.

Ms. Murphy has the legal authority to “turn on” the transition, releasing the $6.3 million in federal funds budgeted for the effort, making office space available and empowering team members to visit agency offices and request information.

It is often seen as the official starting gun. Under normal circumstances, Ms. Murphy’s decision would usually be prompted by the concession speech by the election’s loser, which is not a legal act, but it signals that both sides accept the result. In 2016, the acting administrator of the General Services Administration, also known as the G.S.A., under President Barack Obama made the determination on the morning of Nov. 9, right after the election.

But there is no specific provision for when Ms. Murphy must act.

Pamela D. Pennington, a spokeswoman for the G.S.A., said in a statement on Monday that “an ascertainment has not yet been made.”

She added that the “G.S.A. and its administrator will continue to abide by, and fulfill, all requirements under the law and adhere to prior precedent established by the Clinton administration in 2000.”

In an earlier statement, Ms. Pennington said that “the G.S.A. administrator does not pick the winner in the presidential election,” adding that “the G.S.A. administrator ascertains the apparent successful candidate once a winner is clear based on the process laid out in the Constitution.”

Aides to Mr. Biden said that they expected Ms. Murphy to act within a few days, but that they were bracing for the possibility that political pressure from the president and his Republican allies would prevent that. In a statement on Twitter on Sunday, Jen Psaki, a transition official, gently prodded Ms. Murphy to make the announcement.

“Now that the election has been independently called for Joe Biden, we look forward to the GSA Administrator quickly ascertaining Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as the President-elect and Vice President-elect,” Ms. Psaki wrote. “America’s national security and economic interests depend on the federal government signaling clearly and swiftly that the United States government will respect the will of the American people and engage in a smooth and peaceful transfer of power.”

Mr. Biden’s transition officials were more pointed on Monday night, effectively saying that the Trump administration was reneging on promises made over the past six months to ensure a proper transfer of power if Mr. Biden won.

The officials said that they signed three separate memorandums of agreement — including one signed by Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff — that laid out the access and money Mr. Biden’s team would receive in the days after the election. None of that has been allowed to proceed, they said.

The coronavirus pandemic has made office space less critical for the Biden transition team, which has been mostly meeting remotely for the past several months and will continue to do so, according to a transition official. There is a skeleton staff at the office space that was provided by the government before the election.

But once Ms. Murphy signals that the transition can begin, that office space will be expanded and equipped with computer systems that give the new administration access to classified systems and information, in addition to a secure location to have secret conversations.

If that does not happen in the coming days, the Biden administration has other options. Transition officials have private office space they can continue to use, and Mr. Biden and his team will continue to operate remotely. When the president-elect met with his pandemic advisory board on Monday, he was in Delaware and the board members were on a big screen, calling in from their homes or offices.

The bigger issue would be access to the agencies and the information they need to begin carrying out Mr. Biden’s agenda. But people familiar with Mr. Biden’s transition said there was a partial workaround: Many of the people still working in the federal agencies were close to Mr. Biden’s advisers and might be willing to work with them to provide the unclassified information they need.

But that would not solve the problem of gaining access to classified information, which could affect the ability of Mr. Biden’s national security team to prepare itself for emergencies that it may have to confront once in office. Transition officials said one specific limitation at the moment is that Mr. Biden does not have access to a secure State Department facility that is normally used to route calls from foreign leaders hoping to congratulate the newly elected president.

Mr. Biden has been making those calls, but has not been allowed to use the State Department as has been the practice after previous elections.

Mr. Trump and his allies have criticized Democrats and the news media for projecting Mr. Biden as the winner before legal challenges and recounts have been completed. But historically, the ascertainment decision by the G.S.A. administrator has not waited for the outcomes of such challenges.

In 2004, recounts in New Hampshire and Ohio were completed after the G.S.A. made a decision. And several states were decided by less than a single percentage point. In 2016, five recounts were filed after the G.S.A. announcement, and three were conducted in Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin.

Ms. Murphy is an unlikely figure to be at the center of such an explosive situation: She is a low-key bureaucrat who began her career as a Republican staff member on Capitol Hill and professes her love of procurement reform and lease renegotiations. Democrats who worked with her there said they remembered her as a diligent professional.

But her tenure at the G.S.A., which she has run since December 2017, has not been without controversy.

In 2018, House Democrats concluded that Ms. Murphy had misled them about her agency’s decision to reconsider the F.B.I.’s longtime plans to relocate its aging headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue to a suburban area. Democrats found that Mr. Trump had intervened to kill the plan, potentially because he feared that a commercial developer could turn a vacated J. Edgar Hoover Building into a hotel that would compete with his own Trump International Hotel a block away.

The G.S.A.’s inspector general found that Ms. Murphy’s testimony on the matter to Congress in 2018 was “incomplete and may have left the misleading impression that she had no discussions with White House officials in the decision-making” when in fact she had, including during a visit to the Oval Office in 2017.

House Democrats have also concluded that Ms. Murphy has been slow to furnish them with documents and other information relating to the G.S.A.’s lease of the historic Old Post Office Building in Washington, the site of Mr. Trump’s hotel, to the Trump Organization."
Trump Put Down Philadelphia. The City Got Payback.,"PHILADELPHIA — It was just before noon on Saturday, and Bob Brady was trying to reach Joseph R. Biden Jr. on the phone. Mr. Brady, the chairman of the Philadelphia Democrats, wanted to pass along an increasingly open secret among elections officials and the news media: The city was about to release a tally of roughly 3,000 more votes.

The phone was answered by Mr. Biden’s brother James Biden, who relayed Mr. Brady’s bulletin to the candidate sitting next to him. The significance would not have been lost on anyone who had been closely following the ballot-counting process — if the percentages lined up right for Mr. Biden, the votes would put him over the top.

And, indeed, just as his brother and Mr. Brady hung up the phone, 2,431 votes from the city moved into Mr. Biden’s column, clinching Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes, and with them, the presidency.

Philadelphia and its suburban counties had laid the final brick that rebuilt the proverbial blue wall in 2020, and Democrats here wanted to make sure everyone — especially President Trump — knew it.

As the newly counted votes set off a rapid-fire succession of news outlets calling the race for Mr. Biden, the city that heralds itself as the birthplace of American independence from Britain celebrated the toppling of a leader who had provoked its anger. In laying the groundwork for his baseless claims of voter fraud, Mr. Trump had declared from the debate stage that “bad things happen in Philadelphia,” and over the weekend his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani assailed a history of corruption in the city as he pursued unlikely efforts to challenge the election results.

But ask Philadelphians about when things turned sour with the president, and many will point back more than two years, to his abrupt cancellation of a traditional White House visit for the city’s beloved Eagles football team after its first ever Super Bowl victory in 2018.

In this city with a penchant for deeply held civic grudges, trash talk and impolitic celebrations of its rivals’ travails, where Crisco slathered on telephone poles to prevent climbing is a sign of impending revelry, the blocks around City Hall on Saturday began to resemble the famed Super Bowl parade of 2018.

Chest-pumping pride spilled out, with expressions of enthusiasm for Mr. Biden, the former vice president, often overshadowed by feelings of vengeance toward Mr. Trump.

“Philly knows how to stand up for itself, and love us or hate us, this is what we do right here,” said Rob Cancel, 37, as he joined the celebration outside the city’s convention center on Saturday sporting a red “Bad things happen in Philadelphia” T-shirt. “We come out, we show up and we show them who we are. We’re a strong, strong, proud people.”

Others were more direct.

“I must say, Philly got to tell him he’s fired. Woo!” said Stephanie Marsh, 40, as she skipped down Arch Street toward the convention center.

A widely circulated photograph showed one man holding a sign listing perceived civic adversaries — though it used a different, more profane, word — who had been “defeated by Philadelphia,” including King George III, the former New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Mr. Trump.

Another photo showed a sign held aloft over revelers noting that Mr. Trump had “disinvited the Eagles to the White House.” It added, “So we returned the favor.”

“Philadelphia is a city that will long remember slights, and the fact the president of the United States personally, repeatedly, went after us is something that we absolutely took offense to and wanted to fight back against,” said Representative Brendan Boyle, who represents Northeast Philadelphia and was one of the first members of Congress to endorse Mr. Biden’s presidential campaign. “Donald Trump was insane to pick on Philadelphia. If there was ever a city that anyone should never mess with, it is Philadelphia.”

Separate from the enmity for Mr. Trump, Philadelphia has long been a base of support — and cash — for Mr. Biden, who has strong ties to the city, having served for 36 years as a senator from neighboring Delaware, during which time he lived in the suburbs of Wilmington, Del., about 45 minutes from Center City in Philadelphia. He was sometimes referred to as “Pennsylvania’s third senator,” though his affinity for the state stems to no small degree from his upbringing in Scranton, more than two hours north of Philadelphia.

His wife, Jill Biden, grew up in Philadelphia’s northern suburbs and has maintained its distinct accent, to the approval of discerning Philadelphia ears. The future first couple root for the city’s sports teams, and were on hand for the most glorious moment in its athletic history — the Eagles’ victory over the heavily favored Patriots at the 2018 Super Bowl in Minneapolis.

Two of Mr. Biden’s granddaughters have lived in the city and attended the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia, which was also the alma mater of Mr. Biden’s son Beau, who died in 2015, and the president-elect’s daughter, Ashley, who reportedly still lived in the city as of last month.

After Mr. Biden’s vice presidency, the university became a key part of his professional base, establishing the Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in Washington.

He was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars as a professor by the university, and several of his close advisers, including possible appointees in the nascent Biden administration, were affiliated at various times with the center. They include Steve Ricchetti, the Biden campaign’s chairman and the president-elect’s former vice-presidential chief of staff, as well as Brian McKeon, Colin Kahl, Michael Carpenter and Dan Erikson, former advisers to Mr. Biden.

When Mr. Biden began his presidential bid, he chose Philadelphia for the campaign’s headquarters, as well as his announcement speech and kickoff fund-raiser, which was held at a home in the city’s leafy West Mount Airy neighborhood belonging to David L. Cohen, a senior executive at Comcast. Mr. Cohen, who is also the chairman of the board of trustees of the University of Pennsylvania, had participated in the ribbon-cutting for the Biden Center.

Mr. Biden’s campaign staff had a number of Philadelphia-area natives in prominent roles, including its national political director, Erin Wilson.

To increase turnout in the city, Democrats pulled out all of the stops. They called in celebrity reinforcements like Debra Messing and Kathy Najimy and sent them knocking on doors. They lined up John Legend to croon for a packed parking lot. And they dispatched top political surrogates, including former President Barack Obama and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, to campaign in the city.

Local Democrats augmented the effort. Representative Dwight Evans organized car caravans to snake through neighborhoods in his district, which includes parts of North Philadelphia and West Philadelphia, honking at residents to remind them to vote. On Sunday, his caravan drove for 35 miles. Philadelphia stretches just 15 miles north to south.

“The easy thing about this was, it was not persuasion — you only had to ensure that the process was working,” Mr. Evans said. He added that his own 10th Ward, in the northwest part of the city, had voted for Mr. Biden by 97.5 percent to 2.5 percent over Mr. Trump. “And us doing those car caravans was us explaining that process.”

Five days before the election, Mr. Biden hopped on a Zoom meeting with Philadelphia Democrats, telling them, “Philadelphia is the place where everything happened for me.” He added: “It’s where I raised my money when I was a senator. It’s where I got support. It’s where I got help.”

He turned to his friend Bob Brady, the Democratic chairman. “If you’ve got to be in a foxhole, we want you in there with us,” Mr. Biden said.

For Mr. Brady, who has led the Democratic Party in this city for 34 years, the effort in Philadelphia was personal. Mr. Brady and Mr. Biden are close, having grabbed countless “steaks on the go” through the years, perfecting the familiar lean of bending at the hips to avoid cheesesteak stains on their clothes. After Mr. Obama asked him to be his running mate in 2008, Mr. Biden called his wife, and his next call went to Mr. Brady.

“People were asking how much pressure I had on me because he is my friend,” Mr. Brady said. “A ton of pressure. A ton of pressure.”

And on the Sunday before Election Day, Mr. Biden spoke to canvassers gathered by Congressman Boyle at the campaign headquarters that he shares with his brother, Kevin J. Boyle, a Pennsylvania state representative, in Northeast Philadelphia.

Mr. Biden told the crowd, “We have an expression where I come from: You never forget those who brung you to the dance.”

He thanked Congressman Boyle, saying that “we owe Brendan” for his endorsement on “the day I announced,” and that “it brought along everything else that’s happened.”

When the race was called for Mr. Biden, Mr. Boyle, who gave leave to two of his congressional aides to work in the Biden campaign’s political shop, tweeted: “WE DID IT! PHILLY PUTS BIDEN OVER THE TOP IN PENNSYLVANIA!”

In an interview on Monday, the congressman, who is said to be under consideration for a possible administration post, predicted that a Biden administration would be receptive to the concerns of the Philadelphia area, and not just because of its role in his election.

“It helps to have someone in the White House at the top who is very familiar with our area and cares about it,” Mr. Boyle said.

Biden to Restore a White House Tradition of Presidential Pets,"President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. is expected to restore a time-honored tradition of having a presidential pet at the White House.

Starting in January, the Biden family’s two German shepherds, Champ and Major, as well as a cat, will roam the executive residence.

President Trump was the first president in more than a century not to have a pet of any kind, Andrew Hager, the historian-in-residence at the Presidential Pet Museum, said.

In 2008, the Biden family got a German shepherd puppy from a breeder after Mr. Biden was elected vice president, according to Politico. The Bidens named the dog Champ because Mr. Biden’s father had told him growing up, “Get up, champ,” when his life was challenging.

In 2018, the Biden family adopted their former foster dog, Major, from the Delaware Humane Association.

Mr. Biden would not be the first to have an adopted dog in the White House. President Lyndon B. Johnson’s mixed-breed dog, Yuki, was found by his daughter at a Texas gas station.

In 2016, Lois Pope, a philanthropist for veterans and animals in Palm Beach, Fla., said she had offered Mr. Trump a goldendoodle puppy named Patton, after George Patton, the World War II general that Mr. Trump has said he admires, The Washington Post reported.

At a February 2019 rally in El Paso, Mr. Trump said that he didn’t have a dog because he didn’t have time, and felt it would be “phony” for him to get one for political reasons.

“You do love your dogs, don’t you?” Mr. Trump said. “I wouldn’t mind having one, honestly, but I don’t have any time. How would I look walking a dog on the White House lawn?”

Mr. Biden’s dog Major reflects a broader trend of Americans adopting pets from shelters and how they feel about animal rights, Mr. Hager said.

“In a way, I’ve made the argument that you can look at the history of Americans and animals by looking at the president and their pets,” he said.

Mr. Biden occasionally posts about Champ and Major on social media.

“No ruff days on the campaign trail when I have some Major motivation,” Mr. Biden wrote on Instagram last month.

There was even a separate campaign called Dog Lovers for Joe. Its slogan: “Choose your humans wisely.”

“Red state or Blue state, we all can agree on the power of dogs,” the website said. “It’s time we had a dog-lover back in the White House.”

From the earliest days of the country’s formation, pets have been a tradition for presidents.

President Theodore Roosevelt owned dozens of animals, including a one-legged rooster, snakes, guinea pigs, kangaroo rats and horses, said Jennifer B. Pickens, the author of “Pets at the White House.”

One of the oddest White House pets was a raccoon later named Rebecca that was sent to President Calvin Coolidge to be served at Thanksgiving dinner. In November 1926, Mr. Coolidge pardoned the raccoon and adopted it.

Pets humanize the presidency and help people relate to their owners. Dogs make for cuddly presidential props and provide companionship when presidents make tough decisions, Ms. Pickens said.

During President Richard M. Nixon’s vice-presidential bid in 1952, he weathered a financial-improprieties scandal, partly because he spoke about his dog, Checkers.

President Herbert Hoover’s stuffy, stilted image improved when he humanized himself by releasing a photograph in which he held his German shepherd, King Tut.

President Barack Obama and his family brought Bo, and then Sunny, Portuguese water dogs, into the White House. They were beloved, even after Sunny knocked down a 2-year-old visitor.

“Americans have always had pets, so the White House has always had pets,” Ms. Pickens said."
A Transition Without a Concession,"Biden is moving ahead with his transition plans, but Trump still refuses to concede. Republicans aren’t sure how to handle it. It’s Monday, and this is your politics tip sheet. Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.

Celebrations broke out in cities and towns across the country on Saturday after Joe Biden was declared the winner of the presidential race.

It was a remarkable — and improbable — scene, as our reporters Matt Flegenheimer and Katie Glueck write in a news analysis. Matt and Katie remind us that Biden is the same “institutionalist 70-something, incorrigible square, inexhaustible reciter of Irish poetry” he’s always been. “But then, it seems that defeating President Trump can do strange things for a man’s reputation.”

Biden and Kamala Harris, the vice president-elect, projected an executive air on Saturday night as they strode onstage to address the country in Wilmington, Del., hours after the race had been called.

Harris began with a speech that invited women, particularly women of color, to bask in the milestone of her election as the first female vice president. She invoked her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, who arrived in the United States as an Indian immigrant at 19.

“I am thinking about her and about the generations of women, Black women, Asian, white, Latina, Native American women, who throughout our nation’s history have paved the way for this moment tonight,” Harris said. “Women who fought and sacrificed so much for equality and liberty and justice for all, including the Black women who are too often overlooked, but so often prove they are the backbone of our democracy.”

In his own remarks, Biden declared it “the honor of my lifetime” that the country had sided with his message of unity and head-on confrontation of the coronavirus. Early on Monday, he unveiled a transition team of scientists and experts to prepare his virus response. “That plan will be built on bedrock science,” he said in his speech Saturday.

Veterans of both Republican and Democratic administrations are now calling on Trump to accept his election loss and begin the transition process. But he has shown no willingness to do so — and in fact, he’s been eerily silent other than a cascade of tweets, many of which Twitter has labeled misleading.

The nonpartisan Center for Presidential Transition released a letter on Sunday urging him to move ahead with the transition.

“While there will be legal disputes requiring adjudication, the outcome is sufficiently clear that the transition process must now begin,” wrote the four members of its advisory board, which includes veterans of the Clinton, Obama and George W. Bush administrations. The center has participated in presidential transition activities for four election cycles.

The pressure is now on the General Services Administration, which is responsible for declaring a winning candidate and facilitating the transition process. Its Trump-appointed administrator, Emily Murphy, has not yet affirmed Biden’s victory.

Speaking on CNN’s “State of the Union,” James Clyburn, the Democratic whip in the House and a Biden adviser, pressed Republicans to break with the president. “What matters to me is whether or not the Republican Party will step up and help us preserve the integrity of this democracy,” he said.

Enough votes have been counted in Pennsylvania, Nevada and other close states that it’s clear Trump has lost the election. In Pennsylvania, for instance, ballots received after Election Day have been sorted and counted separately from those received through Nov. 3.

This would become relevant if Republicans succeeded in overturning a state court decision to allow ballots to be accepted up to three days after Election Day. The good news for Biden is that it does not appear losing those ballots alone would be enough to erase his lead in the state.

In Arizona, more votes came in on Sunday, breaking narrowly for Trump. He does not appear to be on pace to overtake Biden in the state, which remains undecided and would only add to Biden’s margin of victory in the Electoral College if he held on to win.

The news in House races across the country has generally been better for Republicans than for Democrats. An exception came in northeastern suburbs outside Atlanta, where Carolyn Bourdeaux was declared the winner on Friday in a House district that had been vacated by the five-term Republican congressman Rob Woodall.

But over all, Democrats have lost a net of five seats in the chamber this cycle, with a number of races across the country still uncalled.

Here’s another thing Republicans have to celebrate: As of last night, Democrats had not flipped a single statehouse chamber in an election year that will determine who controls the decennial process of redistricting.

Democrats are looking at being shut out completely from the district-drawing process — which will use data drawn from the 2020 census — in key states including Florida, Texas and North Carolina. Together, those states will account for more than 80 congressional seats starting in 2022.

Joe Biden was shown speaking on Saturday night in Times Square.

Despite his loss, Trump appears likely to remain a powerful figure in the Republican Party going forward. And many top Republican officials are having a hard time deciding how to handle his refusal to concede.

As ever, the president still has the support of some of the party’s highest-ranking officials. On Sunday, Kristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota, backed up Trump’s unfounded claims that the election had been tainted by irregularities. She cited “computer glitches” and reports of “dead people voting in Pennsylvania” as examples of widespread fraud.

“When you break the process on which we elect our leaders, you will break America forever,” Noem said on ABC’s “This Week,” without any evidence to support her claims.

Melania Trump added her voice to the chorus on Sunday. “The American people deserve fair elections,” she tweeted. “Every legal - not illegal - vote should be counted. We must protect our democracy with complete transparency.”

It appears likely that a sizable chunk of the Republican Party may continue to embrace myths about the fundamental illegitimacy of Biden’s presidency well into the future. Since the race was called on Saturday, the president himself has been posting defiant messages on Twitter.

“Since when does the Lamestream Media call who our next president will be?” he wrote yesterday, despite the fact that it is a long-held tradition for news organizations such as The Associated Press to publicly declare the winner in a presidential race.

George W. Bush, whose own White House claimed the ability to “create our own reality,” was not willing to play along with Trump’s narrative. On Sunday he said that he had called Biden to congratulate him on the victory, becoming the most prominent Republican to effectively rebuke Trump’s effort to deny the results.

“I extended my warm congratulations and thanked him for the patriotic message he delivered last night,” Bush said in a statement, referring to Biden’s speech in Wilmington. He added a note of congratulations to Trump, whose more than 70 million votes he called “an extraordinary political achievement.”

In between those denying the results and those calling on Trump to concede are a number of sitting Republican lawmakers, including Senators Ted Cruz and Roy Blunt, who are now doing an awkward balancing act.

Cruz, who has his own complicated history with Trump, argued without evidence on Sunday that the president still had a legitimate “path to victory” through the Electoral College. In an interview with Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business, Cruz, who represents Texas in the Senate, drew upon his experience as a lawyer on Bush’s team in 2000, when the Supreme Court halted the counting of ballots in Florida and handed the race to the Republican ticket.

“It went twice to the Florida Supreme Court. It went twice to the U.S. Supreme Court. It took 36 days to resolve, and we got an answer,” Cruz said. “I would expect a similar process to play out here, despite the media trying to tell everyone, ‘Give up, go home, we know who we want to win.’”

Blunt, a Missouri senator and member of the Republican leadership, also said on Sunday that he thought it was too early to declare Biden the president-elect. But speaking on ABC’s “This Week,” he allowed that it “seems unlikely” that the election’s outcome would change as more votes were counted.

"As a Bitter Election Ends, 26 Americans Look to the Future","Election night played out as one more anxious chapter in a year characterized by bitter partisan rancor and successive national crises.

As states flickered between blue and red on projection maps, and as vote-counting extended through the week, tensions only rose. In sheer numbers, more people voted in 2020 than ever before, but the results seemed to crystallize the deep divisions in the country — on the virus, the economy, issues of race, and even how to properly count the vote.

For anyone seeking to understand the will of the people, the past week offered little clarity. The only common ground, it seemed, was the sizable majority who told exit polls they felt the country was heading in the wrong direction.

And yet. The vote is fundamentally an instrument of optimism, a chance to shape the future of your community and your country. On Tuesday and in the days leading up to the election, Americans waited in line in record numbers to cast their vote.

We talked to them about their hopes for the country — whatever the outcome of the election. What did they want for America? They spoke about equality, opportunity and coming together as a nation. Here are some of their answers.

Franklin County, Ohio

“My hope for America is all about the children. They need to get back to school. They are our future. They need to see a more respectful and responsible leader.”

Bethel, Maine

“It seems like there’s so much chaos going on right now with the pandemic, and it seems like there’s so much racial differences. I think we need the right leader to bring us together versus separating us or dividing us.”

Candler, N.C.

“I’d just like to see us come back together, you know? And be one people and get along together.”

North Charleston, S.C.

“I just want the best for America. I want it to be in the hands of a good person who can lead the country, that can get us what we need.”

Houston

“We need equality. That’s the thing over all. Everybody bickers. It’s you, it’s us, it’s them. They’re doing this, they’re doing that. Everybody needs to take responsibility for their actions.”

Atlanta

“My hope is that we find our humanity again, that we find a way to be kind to one another, and have empathy in general. I’m in a hopeless place right now in terms of what’s happened to this country, and that’s a lot coming from a Black person. I’ve never seen this total lack of respect for differences.”

Westerville, Ohio

“My hope for the country is freedom for faith, peace and good will to all men. My hope is that abortion is abolished in the future.”

Omaha

“I want to make America great again, but not at the cost of lives and jobs, because I am a self-employed small business owner and I have been affected by the pandemic. It’s hitting home now. I want America to be great again, no matter who wins. This is not us.”

Charleston, S.C.

“I hope people see that the medical leaders that are trying to lead us are trying to help us through something absolutely horrible. My dad is a physician, and I’m going into medicine. It’s really disheartening when people have stopped listening to the people that try and keep us healthy and safe.”

Houston

“I hope that we can get back on track to where people aren’t focused so much on race and being treated different and work together as a team again. You can’t have a great nation without the whole team working together. Football, basketball — you can’t have one good player and have a great team. We need to work together.”

Omaha

“I want to see the virus beat as soon as possible. I want to see the troops all come home. I hate the players kneeling for the national anthem. They don’t respect the flag. I am very proud of my country and my service.”

Wilmington, Del.

“I’m tired of Covid-19, so I hope the country can move past. This has been the worst time for us in our lives, and I want to see that get better and the economy get better.”

Bethel, Maine

“I want equality, and I want women to be just as powerful as how they portray men. They downsize women a lot. I was a firefighter for three years, and I got a lot of crap because I was a female and I did it just as good as they did. So what I want to see is equality.” 

Candler, N.C.

“I want the people to have harmony and love for one another in the country. I’d like to see the people get back to work, take care of their families and everything.”

Levant, Maine

“I’d like to see a lot less fighting, but on top of that, I’d also like to see the middle class go up a little bit. I’d like to see our debt go down. I’d like for us to be able to work a little more on this free speech, be able to say what you want without having to get your head bit off.”

Charleston, S.C.

“It’s gotten harder and harder to live in this country. These essential workers that we need — not just hospital workers but hotel employees, restaurant employees — they can’t afford to live downtown anymore. When I was a kid, everybody lived downtown, every race — everybody lived together. There’s no diversification anymore.”

Wilmington, Del.

“For me, a big thing is being able to respect others’ viewpoints without bashing them. I hope as a country we will come out of this election and realize that even though we may not be happy with the outcome, it’s four years and it’s your civic duty to vote, and you get to do it again in four years and make your voice heard again.”

Maryvale, Ariz.

Phyllis: “I want peace within and peace outside. I want the country to come back together as caring, loving and concerned citizens, where we really live in a way where we can support each other.”

Les: “I would like for us to be sane again.”

Phoenix

“I want this economy to grow, to be able to support the undocumented, for the Latinos to be able to unite with every other race and the whole country to be able to come together and provide a better future for our future generations.”

St. Clair Shores, Mich.

“I’d like to see the country united, and I’d like to see more conservative values.”

Houston

“My hope is that we all come together and there isn’t the toxicity; that somehow we realize we have more in common than we have different. I’ve been fortunate to live in several different states throughout my life, and the one common denominator is that we’re all good people at heart — at least I would hope so.”

San Francisco

“I want America to not see us as animals, you feel me? I want everybody, when they look at me — I don’t want them looking at me just as a Black man. I want them to look at me as an individual.”

Phoenix

“I really want my kids to go back to school safely. Personally, my No. 1 concern right now is the Covid epidemic, and I hope that it can be under control in the coming year. Also, I’m American Indian, I’m Navajo, and I hope that in the next few years Native Americans will have a bigger seat at the table with governments, especially our federal government, which has not been ideal in the last four years.”

Marshalltown, Iowa

“We have more hate in this country than we need. I’d like to do my part to get rid of some of that. But I don’t know where to start.”

"Even as Trump Cut Immigration, Immigrants Transformed U.S.","GRAND ISLAND, Neb. — To grasp the impact of the latest great wave of immigration to the United States, consider the city of Grand Island, Neb.: More than 60 percent of public school students are nonwhite, and their families collectively speak 55 languages. During drop-off at Starr Elementary on a recent morning, parents bid their children goodbye in Spanish, Somali and Vietnamese.

“You wouldn’t expect to see so many languages spoken in a school district of 10,000,” said Tawana Grover, the school superintendent who arrived from Dallas four years ago. “When you hear Nebraska, you don’t think diversity. We’ve got the world right here in rural America.”

The students are the children of foreign-born workers who flocked to this city of 51,000 in the 1990s and 2000s to toil in the area’s meatpacking plants, where speaking English was less necessary than a willingness to do the grueling work.

They came to Nebraska from every corner of the globe: Mexicans, Guatemalans and Hondurans who floated across the Rio Grande on inner tubes, in search of a better life; refugees who fled famine in South Sudan and war in Iraq to find safe haven; Salvadorans and Cambodians who spent years scratching for work in California and heard that jobs in Nebraska were plentiful and the cost of living low.

The story of how millions of immigrants since the 1970s have put down lasting roots across the country is by now well-known. What is less understood about President Trump’s four-year-long push to shut the borders and put “America First” is that his quest may prove ultimately a futile one. Even with one of the most severe declines in immigration since the 1920s, the country is on an irreversible course to becoming ever more diverse, and more dependent on immigrants and their children.

The president since the moment he took office issued a torrent of orders that reduced refugee admissions; narrowed who is eligible for asylum; made it more difficult to qualify for permanent residency or citizenship; tightened scrutiny of applicants for high-skilled worker visas; and sought to limit the length of stay for international students. His policies slashed the number of migrants arrested and then released into the country from nearly 500,000 in the 2019 fiscal year to 15,000 in the 2020 fiscal year.

The measures worked: “We are going to end the decade with lower immigration than in any decade since the ’70s,” said William Frey, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who analyzed newly available census data.

President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has pledged to reverse many of the measures. He has vowed to reinstate Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known as DACA, an Obama-era program that allowed young adults mainly brought to the United States illegally as children to remain, and to resume accepting refugees and asylum seekers in larger numbers.

He has also said he would introduce legislation to offer a path to citizenship for people in the country illegally.

Yet immigration remains a flash point for Americans, millions of whom have supported Mr. Trump’s clampdown, and pushing any substantial immigration reform through Congress will prove difficult as long as Republicans remain in control of the Senate.

And in any case, Mr. Trump’s immigration legacy cannot be unraveled overnight. While some of the executive orders and memorandums that helped close off the border can be rolled back swiftly, hundreds of technical but significant changes made to the immigration system will take much longer to undo.

But as Grand Island shows, nothing that Mr. Trump has done was able to halt the inexorable shifts unleashed by the biggest wave of immigration since the 1890s, when Southern and Eastern Europeans arrived in huge numbers through Ellis Island.

Even if immigration were to come to a standstill, their offspring would continue to reshape the country.

In 1992, 50 Hispanics were enrolled in Grand Island’s schools. By 2001, there were 1,600 out of about 7,600 students. Now, Latinos account for more than half of the 10,000 students in the district, and there is no forecast that does not show that proportion continuing to accelerate.

A surge in arrivals into the United States began in the 1970s, gathered strength in the 1980s and crested in the early 2000s. Millions of Latin Americans have come. There also has been spectacular growth in the number of Asians, who outnumbered foreign-born Hispanics between 2010 and 2019. The new immigrants are more likely than native-born Americans to have a college degree and are integrated into every level of the economy. This is even more true of their children.

In San Francisco, Vida Ahyong, 37, a U.S.-born daughter of Filipino immigrants, runs the Covid-19 diagnostic lab at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, overseeing a staff that includes younger Latino, African and Asian researchers who are also children of immigrants. One of them is Gloria Castañeda, 24, a Yale graduate, born in California to a janitor and a truck driver, both Mexican immigrants.

The family of Aslan Kat, 17, was granted asylum in the United States after escaping the civil war in Syria five years ago. He is the captain of the varsity soccer team at Wayne Hills High School in Wayne, N.J., and hopes to play in college, where he plans to study engineering. Among his teammates are immigrants from Armenia, Cuba and Egypt.

In 1920, the foreign-born accounted for 13.2 percent of the population. A backlash against Japanese, Southern Europeans and Jews, among others, resulted in national origin quotas adopted in 1924 that put an end to a large influx that had started in the late 1800s.

It would take until the 1970s for immigration to climb steadily again, after the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 eliminated quotas and created a system based on family relationships and work categories.

The foreign-born population grew by 5.6 million in the ’80s, 8.8 million in the ’90s and 11.3 million in the 2000s.

By the time Mr. Trump took office, this contemporary wave of immigration had lifted the foreign-born population to 44.5 million, representing 13.7 percent of the population, the biggest share since 1910. Among them were about 11 million undocumented immigrants.

During his first week in office, the president introduced a travel ban to halt the entry of people from many Muslim countries and paused refugee resettlement, citing terrorist threats.

As Central American migrants fleeing violence and poverty showed up at the border by the busload, his administration introduced policies to deter them, including the separation of migrant children from their parents.

He was able to do it by bypassing a Congress that has long been deadlocked on immigration reform, issuing a series of executive orders and proclamations that rapidly shut the door on immigration despite a flurry of legal challenges.

“Trump has demonstrably proven that you don’t need a grand deal to tackle immigration and border security,” said James Carafano of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.

Average net migration shrank by 45 percent between 2017 and 2019 from an average of 953,000 during the previous seven years, as fewer immigrants arrived and more left, according to a Center for Immigration Studies analysis of census data.

There will be an even more precipitous decline recorded by the close of 2020 following visa restrictions imposed by the president amid the coronavirus pandemic.

“This year is truly unprecedented in how dramatic and fast this decline in immigration has been,” said David Bier, an immigration analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. “Outside of wars and the Great Depression, we have never seen a level of immigration like we are seeing right now.”

Mr. Trump put much of the focus on disparaging refugees and immigrants as drains on public coffers and championing a wall on the southwestern border.

Yet all the attention on the border ignored the much more significant growth in immigration that was happening elsewhere in the country.

The number of immigrants of Asian origin grew by 2.8 million in the nine years ending 2019, more than from any other region. The biggest gains were among Indians and Chinese; the number of Mexicans dropped by 779,000.

Many of the recent immigrants have settled in parts of the country where there is a low concentration of foreign-born people, including in states that voted for Mr. Trump in both 2016 and 2020.

Among them are Shikha Jaiswal, a nephrologist, and her husband, Nihit Gupta, a child and adolescent psychiatrist, who came to the United States from India to complete their residencies and are building their careers in a medically underserved area of West Virginia.

Small-town America has come to rely on a pipeline of foreign doctors. “People have been very kind and grateful at the same time, making it a very rewarding experience,” Dr. Jaiswal said.

The children of immigrants who are already here will continue to make the United States more diverse: The 2020 census is expected to show that more than half of people under 18 are people of color.

“The mainstream now increasingly includes people who are nonwhite, particularly from immigrant backgrounds,” said Richard Alba, a sociology professor at the City University of New York Graduate Center.

The movement of the baby boom generation out of the labor force amid a plummeting birthrate is accelerating the trend and intensifying the need for new immigrant labor to pay the Social Security and Medicare bills for retiring Americans.

“It’s not that native-born kids can’t take the boomers’ jobs; it’s that there are not enough of these kids to take them,” said Dowell Myers, a demographer at the University of Southern California who researches the subject.

That diversity is already being reflected in the higher rungs of the work force.

For much of the second half of the 20th century, white workers held a virtual monopoly on the best-paying positions. But by 2015, among top-earning workers under 50, about a third were nonwhite, mainly Latinos or Asians of immigrant origin, according to research by Mr. Alba, who predicts that their share will only grow.

A study released last month found that nearly 30 percent of all students enrolled in colleges and universities in 2018 hailed from immigrant families, up from 20 percent in 2000. 

“When you start having cohorts of college graduates that are so diverse, it’s going to change the work force, which means more people from diverse backgrounds moving into positions of authority and high remuneration,” Mr. Alba said. “There’s no going back.”"
An Early Test for Biden: Managing a Divided Democratic Party,"Ever since President Trump won the White House in 2016, a shocked Democratic Party had been united behind the mission of defeating him. Four years later, with the election of Joseph R. Biden Jr., the divides that have long simmered among Democrats are now beginning to burst into the open, as the president-elect confronts deep generational and ideological differences among congressional lawmakers, activists and the party’s grass-roots base.

The fault lines began to emerge within hours of Mr. Biden’s victory. Moderates argued that his success, particularly in industrial Midwestern states that Mr. Trump seized from the Democrats in 2016, was proof that a candidate who resisted progressive litmus tests was best positioned to win back voters who had abandoned the Democratic Party. Those tests included single-payer health care, aggressive measures to combat climate change and expanding the Supreme Court.

“The progressives said we need a base candidate,” said Rahm Emanuel, the former mayor of Chicago and White House chief of staff under President Barack Obama, referring to a nominee who appeals to the left wing of the party. “No we didn’t. We needed someone to get swing voters. If you campaign appropriately, you can make that a governing transformation.”

Moderate Democrats said they were hopeful the urgency of the problems confronting the nation would delay the inevitable reckoning the party faces between its ideological wings. Beyond that, they said that a disappointing showing by Democrats in congressional races — the party lost seats in the House and faces a struggle for even narrow control of the Senate — would give liberal Democrats less of a platform to push Mr. Biden to the left.

After a fiery call among members of the House Democratic caucus, in which some argued that progressives who have entertained ideas like defunding the police or “Medicare for all” had cost the party congressional seats, some Democratic leaders pushed further away from the left wing.

Representative Conor Lamb, a moderate from Pennsylvania who survived a difficult Republican challenge, said the results should be a wake-up call to the left.

“What we heard from a lot of our constituents was that they do not like the Democratic message when it comes to police in Western Pennsylvania, and when it comes to jobs and energy,” he said. “And that we need to do a lot of work to fix that.”

But after four years of pent-up frustration and energy, that may prove unlikely. By every early indication, Mr. Biden’s election has emboldened progressive energy, no matter the setbacks in the congressional races. There is an up-and-coming generation of elected Democratic officials who have been waiting in the wings, eager to take the lead in formulating a platform for the party.

After supporting Mr. Biden as a means of defeating Mr. Trump, younger and more progressive Democrats who have gained a foothold in Congress and among party activists are skeptical about his future administration. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, setting policy terms in a statement after Mr. Biden was declared victorious, said: “A Band-Aid approach won’t get the job done. We have a mandate for action on bold plans to meet these twin health and economic crises.”

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a leading voice of the party’s left wing, said in a phone interview that the next few weeks would set the tone for how the incoming administration will be received by liberal activists.

“I think that’s what people are keeping an eye out for: Is this administration going to be actively hostile and try to put in appointments that are going to just squash progressives and organizing?” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. “I don’t envy the Biden team. It’s a very delicate balance. But I think it’s really important to strike a good one. Because it sends a very, very powerful message on the intention to govern.”

The fault lines crystallize the task ahead for Mr. Biden, who has long seen himself as a pragmatic consensus builder rather than a strict ideologue. In addition to the fractures within his party, Mr. Biden’s administration will also have to navigate a Republican Senate, unless Democrats wrest two seats in Georgia during closely watched runoff elections in January.

If the party doesn’t win those seats, an already divided Washington looks likely to endure.

Some moderate Democratic leaders urged the president-elect to head off any internal conflict by embracing policies both sides can agree on and reaching out to the left.

“The first thing I would do if I were Joe Biden is I’d propose a $15-an-hour minimum wage,” said Edward G. Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania and a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee. “That’s something that both sides agree on. That would be the first action on behalf of President Biden to show there are significant parts of the progressive agenda that need to be acted on.”

Given the two Senate runoffs taking place in Georgia — contests that will determine whether Mr. Biden will, like Mr. Obama, begin his first term with a unified Washington — Mr. Biden might be initially reluctant to embrace positions that could make it easier for Republicans in Georgia to paint Democrats as out-of-touch, radical socialists.

Mr. Biden has made clear he intends for his administration’s cabinet to be diverse in race, gender and sexual orientation — but a left wing that has become disenchanted with the inherent idea of representation as progress will be looking for concessions of power.

Grass-roots political groups on the left had a dual message for the president-elect: Congratulations — and here’s a list of demands. Several signaled that they expected Mr. Biden to defer to some demands of progressives, not only by selecting people from that wing of the party for key cabinet positions but also by excluding people with a Wall Street or lobbying background from the administration’s hiring process. However, Mr. Biden’s flexibility in making cabinet appointments sought by the left will be constrained if the Senate remains in Republican hands.

Jamaal Bowman, a progressive New York Democrat who will be sworn into the next Congress, took the view that Mr. Biden’s victory was not an affirmation of moderate ideology, but a testament to a diverse Democratic Party that had embraced the shared goal of defeating an unpopular president. He cited the work during the general election of progressive groups and candidates who opposed Mr. Biden during the Democratic primary, including young climate organizers like the Sunrise Movement — and said they should be rewarded.

“We have to move past the moderate-versus-liberal conversations and start speaking and moving together as a strong party,” Mr. Bowman said. “We have organizations like the Sunrise Movement and candidates like Jamaal Bowman who have gone out of our way to get Joe Biden elected.”

Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said she expected a long-term fight, particularly given the setbacks for Democrats in the congressional contests. She also cited cabinet appointments as a way to measure Mr. Biden’s ideological core.

She said some people, including Mr. Emanuel, should not play a role in the party’s future. The former mayor has been floated by some in Mr. Biden’s inner circle to lead a department like housing or transportation.

“Someone like Rahm Emanuel would be a pretty divisive pick,” she said, citing his record as mayor on racial justice and his opposition to teachers’ unions. “And it would signal, I think, a hostile approach to the grass-roots and the progressive wing of the party.”

It is unclear what kind of audience progressives will find with Mr. Biden and his administration. Throughout the year, his campaign sought to project unity through measures like a joint task force with supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders, which led a campaign to adopt some of the left wing’s policy proposals, including plans around college debt. But Mr. Biden stopped short of the biggest ideas, like eliminating the Electoral College or embracing statehood for Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.

Some leading Democratic Party moderates said they supported many of the ideological goals on the left but, reflecting what has long been a divide between the two wings, urged caution, particularly because of Democratic losses in other races.

“We all have to take a deep breath,” said Representative Debbie Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan, a state that Mr. Trump snatched from Democrats in 2016 but that Mr. Biden won back this year. “I know there are going to be people who are pushing for change. I’m one of those people who want Medicare for all.”

She argued that Democrats needed to be careful not to push away voters whom Mr. Trump won in 2016, or else risk another, similar candidate.

“I also know we can’t afford to have Donald Trump as president,” she said.

But Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster who advised President Bill Clinton when he successfully pushed the party to the center in the 1990s, said Mr. Biden would be able to delay divisive party fights because of the enormity of the crises he faces.

“The nature of the pandemic and the economic and health crisis is so deep, he will inherit a mandate of urgency,” he said. “Unity within the party and unity within the country.”

But for some on the left, the pandemic and the resulting economic crisis were reasons to push the administration further — not to back off. They cited mistakes made as Mr. Obama began his administration in 2009, when many believed the party’s progressive wing was too deferential to the new president in a moment of economic crisis.

“I don’t think there will be a grace period for Biden, because the country doesn’t have time for a grace period,” said Heather McGhee, a former president of Demos, a progressive policy and research organization. “A million more people in poverty don’t have time for a grace period. A racial epidemic and the coronavirus pandemic isn’t taking a grace period. As he is declared the winner, he needs to be putting a team in place that can really change Washington.”

Nina Turner, a co-chair of Mr. Sanders’s 2020 presidential campaign, said she expected progressives to pressure Mr. Biden’s transition team and administration from the outset. When asked how open she thought Mr. Biden would be to the left, she said, “If the rhetoric that’s being used on the campaign trail is any indication, not very open.”

Still, she said, “things have an amazing way of changing once you’re in the office and you get that pressure.”"
Trump Lost the Race. But Republicans Know It’s Still His Party.,"The election of 2020 ended for Republican Party leaders a lot like the election of 2016 began: As much as they may want to move on from Donald J. Trump, he won’t let them — and neither will the voters.

After losing the White House to Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the popular vote in seven presidential elections since 1980, and facing the possibility of defeat in Arizona and Georgia where losses were once unthinkable, Republicans were grappling with how to untangle the man from a movement that is likely to dictate party politics for years.

Even in defeat, Republicans saw clear indicators of the enduring power of Trump-style populism. By the time Mr. Biden gave his victory speech on Saturday evening, Mr. Trump had received 7.4 million more votes than he did in 2016 — one million more in the battleground of Florida alone. Republicans cut into the Democratic majority in the House with wins in several swing districts from Iowa to New York, where they followed Mr. Trump’s slash-and-burn playbook of branding his opponents as far-left hysterics.

No one seems to be under the illusion that Mr. Trump will fade quietly. All week, as he launched an extraordinary, baseless attack on the integrity of the election, few in his party challenged claims that he was being cheated of a victory. Privately, some began discussing the possibility that he might not concede, which would put them in the awkward position of having to choose whether to defend him until Mr. Biden’s inauguration in two and a half months.

This dynamic presents a problem for the Republicans who will run for office after Mr. Trump is no longer the leader of the party, on paper at least. In particular, Republicans in their 30s and 40s see a road map to the bigger and more diverse coalition that the party has tried to build for two decades, if they can salvage the more popular aspects of the president’s appeal to middle-class Americans while jettisoning the racial grievances he fanned.

From inside Senate offices, think tanks and over off-the-record salons on Zoom, the conversations about what’s next have grown in urgency now that the final months of the Trump presidency are at hand.

“He is sort of the king with no heirs,” said Oren Cass, the executive director of American Compass, a group that hosts monthly online happy hours of Capitol Hill staff and policy experts to debate the successes and failures of the Trump agenda. Mr. Cass said Mr. Trump’s defeat set up a clash between more conventional Republicans who, on the one hand, took the attitude that “this too shall pass, and we can go back to doing to what we were doing before,” and those who think the president “called attention to a certain set of issues and voters that certainly the center-right wasn’t paying enough attention to.”

Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who said that the president’s critics would probably be happier if there were “a mute button” that allowed people to only see policy, expressed a view that had taken hold among conservatives — one that would seem to rule out any reflective, autopsy-style self-assessment of how they lost.

The fact that Mr. Trump’s defeat was not the blowout critics had hoped, Mr. Rubio said, means that the anticipated repudiation of Trumpian politics was wrong. “Trump was going to get wiped out, the G.O.P. was going to get wiped out,” he said, running through often-repeated predictions. “Meanwhile, Republicans are going to probably hold the Senate and make up to a 10-seat gain in the House.”

While Mr. Rubio said he could not imagine a scenario in which Mr. Trump was not in the picture — “He’s not going to just vanish into a building” — the president’s strong support among Latino voters in Florida (47 percent) and Texas (40 percent) showed how the party could expand a “multiethnic, working-class coalition” that did not fit neatly inside the left-right paradigm.

“I think that a lot of people just don’t realize that when it comes to identity,” Mr. Rubio said, “the identity tied to your employment, your culture, your standard of living, your values, is much more powerful than the pronunciation of your last name.”

Navigating the unavoidable, disruptive force that is Mr. Trump complicates an already difficult job for conservatives like Mr. Rubio, 49. First, Republicans need to convince more voters of color that they are welcoming, despite embracing Mr. Trump and his divisive message. “If someone expresses hatred or disdain for people like you, it’s going to make it hard for them to vote for you,” Mr. Rubio said.

They also need to demonstrate that Republicans can be the party for Americans who are struggling economically — many of whom were won over by Mr. Trump’s message — not just the party that cuts taxes for corporations and dismantles government regulations. 

A “pro-worker” Republican Party, as described by the likes of Senator Josh Hawley, 40, of Missouri, would require a sea change in the way its members tend to balk at spending when there is a Democratic president.

Mr. Hawley, like Mr. Rubio, has been vocal about the need to pass a second coronavirus relief package, breaking with Republicans who have expressed concerns about growing deficits. Some conservatives have proposed less conventional ways of appealing to the party’s core constituencies, including social conservatives, by embracing ideas typically associated with Democrats, like paid family leave.

Yuval Levin, a scholar with the American Enterprise Institute who has been convening discussions with leading conservatives about the post-Trump landscape, said it would be unwise for Republicans not to embrace the pro-middle-class parts of the Trump agenda that he campaigned on in 2016, but then largely abandoned. “It’s not really even Trump’s message,” Mr. Levin said. “He’s been president for four years, and his only legislative accomplishment is a perfectly traditional tax cut bill.”

If Mr. Trump did anything, Mr. Levin said, it was to shatter the notion that voters want Republicans to talk about smaller government. “A lot of people have been instinctively, reflexively saying, ‘We can’t be spending this kind of money right now.’ And I’m thinking, what voters want that? Who’s saying don’t give us money?” he said.

For starters, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. He, Nikki R. Haley and other Republicans who want a starring role in the party’s post-Trump reboot have revived Tea Party-like critiques of government stimulus. This year, Ms. Haley resigned from the board of Boeing after the company asked for federal aid to help weather the pandemic-induced recession. She cited her “strong convictions that this is not the role of government.”

Other conservatives say that Republicans need to accept that Mr. Trump realigned the party’s coalition away from wealthy, well-educated people in the suburbs, and that they should not obsess over winning those voters back.

Twenty-five years ago, Republican voters were more likely than Democrats to have a college degree. Now the reverse is true, with college graduates making up 41 percent of Democratic voters compared with 30 percent of Republican voters, according to the Pew Research Center. 

“We are, by and large, no longer the party of white college graduates,” said Rachel Bovard, senior director of policy at the Conservative Partnership Institute. “That was the Reagan coalition, and the Reagan coalition doesn’t exist anymore.”

Florida provided a model for what the future could look like. Mr. Trump easily won there, two Democratic members of Congress lost their seats, and voters approved a measure to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026 — with 61 percent support. In a post-election memo, the Trump campaign noted how its improvement over 2016 came not from suburban or rural counties, but “from larger, more urban counties.”

Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a Republican elected twice in a heavily Democratic state, is credited with showing how his party can appeal in Black communities and with other traditionally left-leaning constituents by focusing on a middle-class message. He has one of the highest approval ratings of any governor in the country, with equal support from white and Black voters.

Unlike other Republicans, Mr. Hogan has been public in his criticism of the president, and said he cast a write-in vote for Ronald Reagan. Reflecting on 2020, he argued that when Republicans look at how they lost, the answer won’t be voter fraud but rather a president who insisted on making his re-election about resentment and blame instead of how he would make the American economy work for everyone.

“One, he didn’t focus on the things that he ran on the first time. And he didn’t accomplish a lot for those folks,” Mr. Hogan said. “Two, the tone of anger and division turned off voters who might have been receptive to that message.”

Still, Mr. Hogan said, the election was neither a total repudiation of Mr. Trump or an embrace of Democrats. “It wasn’t a rejection of the Republican Party,” he said. “It was not an acceptance of the far left.”

Republicans disagree on how deeply Mr. Trump has changed the party. In their most hopeful assessment, they argued that his influence was most noticeable in matters of style and tone, and that was not permanent. Dwindling are the days, some said, of Republican candidates bringing cardboard cutouts of Mr. Trump to campaign events, cursing in their ads and competing for the honor to claim they first embodied his belligerent style as someone who was “Trump before Trump.”

“We’ve got to figure out again how to be happy warriors like Reagan,” said Scott Walker, the former governor of Wisconsin who lost his seat in the Democratic rebound of 2018. He is now chief executive of Young America’s Foundation, where he is focused on college students, a group that has recoiled from the Republican Party under Mr. Trump.

Republicans, he said, need to do a better job of settling on a message that is more inclusive and begins “with the premise that even those you disagree with can be inherently good.”

A Republican strategist, Kristen Soltis Anderson, said it would be a mistake for the party to gloss over its failures, especially with younger voters, women and the minority groups that broke overwhelmingly for Mr. Biden. “He showed us part of the formula,” she said of Mr. Trump. “Now we’ve got to find someone who can get us the rest of the way.”

But Ms. Anderson’s research shows how difficult it may be finding someone else who can hold together and expand the Trump coalition. A poll last month from her firm, Echelon Insights, asked Republicans and Republican-leaning independents if they considered themselves a supporter of Mr. Trump or of the Republican Party.

Fifty-eight percent picked Mr. Trump.

How Democrats Missed Trump’s Appeal to Latino Voters,"PHOENIX — Democrats thought it would be enough.

After four years of draconian Trump immigration policies and divisive messaging, the Biden campaign courted Latino voters primarily by reminding them that Joseph R. Biden Jr. was not Donald Trump, that if they felt targeted in President Trump’s America, a vote for Mr. Biden would change that.

That argument resonated for many Latinos, who became the second-largest voting group for the first time this year.

“He’s come after people like me,” said Taylor Valencia, 23, a first-year elementary schoolteacher who showed up before sunrise on Tuesday to vote in person in Guadalupe, a predominantly Latino town near Phoenix. “His entire presidency is an attack on my moral values and who I am.”

But for others, it was Mr. Trump who made them feel a part of America, not targeted by it.

“I have been in this country since I was 9, I have been through a lot, and I am American,” said Teresita Miglio, an accountant in her 60s who immigrated from Cuba and attends an evangelical church in Miami where Mr. Trump spoke in January. “Abortion is the litmus test, Jesus is my savior and Trump is my president.”

Mr. Biden is now the president-elect, and as he vows to work “as hard for those who didn’t vote for me as those who did,” as he said in his victory speech on Saturday, he must grapple with the fact that Mr. Trump actually improved his showing among Latino voters, from under 30 percent in 2016 to closer to one-third this year, according to exit polls and voter surveys.

Democrats lost in Florida, in part because of lackluster support among Latino voters. They did basically no better than they normally do in Texas, in part because Hispanic voters in the Rio Grande Valley moved decisively toward the G.O.P. But in Arizona, Barry Goldwater’s home state and a once-conservative stronghold where Mr. Biden has a slim lead, Democrats will claim both of the state’s Senate seats for the first time in decades, fueled by young, progressive Latino voters.

For years, many Democrats have presumed demography as destiny, believing that Latinos would come to vote for them with the same kind of consistency that Black voters do. A growing Latino population, they hoped, would transform the political landscape and give the party an edge in the Southwest.

That dream ran into reality in this election, in which the results confirmed what was evident from conversations with hundreds of Latino voters in dozens of settings from the early days of the Democratic primary until the long ballot-counting hours in Arizona over the last week: The Latino vote is deeply divided, and running as not-Trump was always going to be insufficient.

At a Trump rally in Rio Rancho, N.M., last fall, Martha Garcia was part of the largely Hispanic crowd — many members of which wore Make America Great Again hats — waiting hours in the blazing sun to hear the president speak. She said she agreed with his harsh language on immigration: “We need to take care of the people who are already here.”

In east Las Vegas and Los Angeles, young progressives distraught over the Super Tuesday losses by “Tío Bernie” — Senator Bernie Sanders — remained politically active for the first time. At a Spanish-speaking evangelical megachurch in Miami, the pastor offered the president a blessing for re-election campaign early this year. And in South Phoenix on the eve of the election, grandfathers gathered last weekend for “Low Ridin’ With Biden,” showing off their custom Impalas.

For Latinos, this was an election that turned on feelings about Mr. Trump above all else.

That just didn’t mean what Democrats, and the Biden campaign specifically, assumed it did.

“We went in the wrong direction, and we want to make sure that does not happen again,” said Julián Castro, the only Latino candidate in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.

For months, he said, he had been publicly warning of the coming risks for Democrats from underinvesting in Latino voters, particularly in Texas. He said he was worried that even with a Biden victory, the party would find itself “winning the battle but losing the war.”

On Saturday, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat and one of the most prominent Latina members of Congress, spoke critically of her party’s efforts at connecting with Latino voters. “I don’t think that our party has ever seriously done the work,” she said, describing what she saw as concern only around election years. “That’s not acceptable for any community. I don’t know why it’s acceptable for so many communities of color.”

Both candidates in 2020 knew that Latino voters had the power to be decisive, and both campaigns went after them, at times with little sophistication. After the Democratic primary began with several candidates speaking Spanish on debate stages, the general-election approach — or as some critics call it, “Hispandering” — took a musical turn. Mr. Biden played the hit song “Despacito” on his cellphone speaker, and the Trump campaign commissioned a salsa music video played over Mexican folklórico dancers.

Fellow Democrats complained about the Biden campaign’s sluggish Latino outreach for months, though the campaign eventually spent a record $20 million on Spanish-language television and radio advertising, more than double the Trump campaign’s $9 million, according to Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm. And both campaigns tried to target voters based on regional and national origin — there were advertisements featuring Cuban, Puerto Rican and Mexican accents.

Indeed, the regional differences illustrate both political shifts and the way Latinos see themselves. In Arizona, for example, a historically Republican state shifted because of young Latinos who were politically activated by Senate Bill 1070, a 2010 state measure that was known as the “show me your papers” law and that critics called legalized racial profiling.

“People pretty much tend to attack us,” Alma Aguilar said at a small Black Lives Matter demonstration in the Phoenix suburbs this summer. “We are not treated the same way as white people.”

Even as votes were still being counted, many Democrats credited young Latinas such as Ms. Aguilar for their success in the state. Local activists noted that while the Democrats celebrated, organizing voters began long before the national party invested in the state.

“We did this,” said Alejandra Gomez, the co-executive director of Lucha, a voter engagement group that was established in response to anti-immigration state policies a decade ago. “We organized when nobody else was paying attention. It’s weird to say, but without that, I am not sure we would have flipped the state.”

Yet one lesson of Arizona — that political identity is often built in the face of persecution — did not bear out in Texas, where over a year ago a gunman killed 22 people in El Paso, the largest anti-Latino attack in modern American history, after the authorities said he wrote a manifesto that echoed much of the president’s language.

Texas didn’t even come close to flipping to the Democrats this year. Roughly 25 to 30 percent of Latino voters nationally have chosen Republican candidates for decades, but many Democrats said they were particularly alarmed by the loss of support in the Rio Grande Valley, where Mr. Biden won some border counties by significantly smaller margins than Hillary Clinton did in 2016. 

“More people are waking up,” said Kelly Gonzalez, who attended a Republican election party in Harlingen, in South Texas, with her husband, her 1-year-old daughter and her 7-year-old son, each of them clad in Trump gear from head to toe. In the once reliably left-leaning region, Ms. Gonzalez said her opinion of liberals — particularly young ones — had changed in the last four years. “It’s like, ‘Give me this, give me that,’ and they don’t want to work for it,” she said.

Minerva Simpson, a district leader for the Texas Federation for Republican Women, who was one of the hosts of the party, said the president was critical to the energy she saw.

“We’ve seen the Latinos come out in a very strong way,” she said. “I’ve never seen a movement like that in my culture, and it’s all for Trump.”

Democrats also did not seem to account for how effective Mr. Trump’s efforts to tie their party to socialism would be, especially among Venezuelan- and Cuban-American voters in Florida.

“If Biden gets elected, America will go down the rabbit hole of socialism into communism within the next year,” said Gilbert Fonticoba, an internet marketer, who stood with a group waving American and Trump flags in front of a polling place in the city of Hialeah outside Miami on Tuesday. He said he became unemployed after his social media accounts were disabled because of his views as a member of the Proud Boys, a far-right group, adding that his parents had fled Cuba.

Mr. Fonticoba blamed the country’s polarization in part on the news media. “Millennials are brainwashed,” he said. “There’s a lot of dumb people that live in this country that believe the fake news.” Then, unprompted, he brought up the Proud Boys, denying that they had ties to white supremacy. “Proud Boys are for America, keeping America the way America was created,” he said. “The West is the best.”

The Biden campaign did recognize its potential weakness with Cubans and Venezuelans, but hoped that support from younger Latinos, particularly Puerto Ricans, might make up the difference. To make its case in Florida and elsewhere, the campaign emphasized the reality that Latinos were contracting and dying from the coronavirus and suffering economically at disproportionately high rates, and that the president had mishandled the pandemic. One of the final ads the campaign ran in battleground states, including Florida, Arizona and Nevada, focused on the Trump administration’s family separation policy.

But the fact that Mr. Biden is heading to the White House is not cause for a victory lap when it comes to engaging Latino voters, according to those who work on that issue.

“We were not choosing our savior, we were choosing our opponent,” said Marisa Franco, the executive director of Mijente, a Latino civil rights organization that originally backed Mr. Sanders, explaining her group’s work in 2020. “The Biden campaign may have chosen not to spend time in working-class, immigrant and people-of-color neighborhoods, but that is exactly where his victory is coming from and where the solutions he’ll need to champion will have to start.”

Most Latino groups have not expressed surprise at the election’s results. They have long noted, for example, how little conservative religious South American voters in Florida backing Mr. Trump have in common with progressive young Mexican-Americans in Arizona turning out for Democrats. But the groups’ leaders also argue that without pushing the idea of a pan-Latino political identity, Latinos in any one region might never get sustained attention from national candidates.

In September, a nonpartisan group called the Texas Organizing Project released a report based on interviews with more than 100 Latinos in Texas that offered a preview of how 2020 might go.

“The majority do not feel there is a singular ‘Latino Vote,’ the report concluded. “Though they see its potential.”

The Election Is Over. The Nation’s Rifts Remain.,"MAPLEWOOD, N.J. — A late-morning stillness had settled over a November Saturday in a cozy blanket of suburban serenity. Suddenly, at stadium-level blast, there came the shattering rock ’n’ roll roar of victory:

We will, we will rock youWe will, we will rock you

The sounds of something unleashed — banging pots, honking horns, primal shouts — burst from all directions in Maplewood, N.J. And as another Queen song boomed from the muscular loudspeakers in his garage, Zack Kurland stood at the edge of his driveway, arms raised like Rocky.

We are the championsWe are the champions

His wife, Neena Kumar, came running and leapt into his arms. News had just arrived that Joseph R. Biden Jr. had been declared the winner of the presidential election of 2020, and now the two were twirling in an impromptu public dance of triumph.

The moment evoked an iconic American image: a World War II sailor spontaneously kissing a woman in a nurse’s uniform in Times Square after the news of victory in Europe. Only instead of V-J Day, this was V-B Day: Victory for Biden.

But not everyone was dancing. Triumph in a foreign war unifies a country; triumph in an election has the lurking potential to further divide. And by Sunday morning, some of the celebration and grieving had melted away to expose a difficult question for divided families and a divided nation:

Now what?

True, a record number of more than 75 million Americans had voted for Mr. Biden, the Democratic challenger, and his running mate, Kamala Harris, the first woman elected as vice president. Also true was that more than 71 million others now had to grapple with the concept that their candidate — Donald J. Trump, the Republican incumbent — would most likely be branded by his own worst epithet: loser.

If Trump loyalists were honking their horns at all on Saturday, it was probably to clear rejoicing Biden supporters from the streets. And the only hope being offered by their leader was a vow to challenge in the courts what he asserted, without evidence, was a fraudulent election.

By refusing, for now, to publicly accept the election results, Mr. Trump was all but inviting dance-interrupting discord. And some accepted his invitation.

Trump supporters held “Stop the Steal” rallies outside state capitols across the country, though their cries of electoral corruption sometimes came as news of Mr. Biden’s declared victory was lighting up smartphones everywhere.

In Sacramento, Calif., videos captured confrontations that devolved into physical assaults; some in the scrum wore the black-and-yellow polo shirts often associated with the Proud Boys, a far-right, pro-Trump group not unfamiliar with violence. Another video, from Salem, Ore, showed a man in Proud Boys apparel discharging what appeared to be pepper spray, after which a crowd battered a vehicle with fists and a baseball bat.

These small moments reflect the sizable fissure in the collective American psyche that Mr. Biden sought to begin closing in his speech on Saturday night. With a stand of American flags behind him, he said the time had come to restore the nation’s soul; to embrace the first three words of the Constitution: “We the people.”

Mr. Biden knows from experience how difficult such simple sentiments are to attain. Another historic moment not long ago — the 2008 election of the country’s first Black president, Barack Obama, with Mr. Biden as his vice president — also prompted dancing in the streets. And it, too, was framed as a moment of healing unification. The feeling did not last.

But Mr. Biden still recognized a need to sound the call, once again, for the nation to come together. “It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric,” he said. “To lower the temperature. To see each other again. To listen to each other again.”

His words seemed directed as much to the individual American as to the nation at large, as if to recognize the gaping rifts created over the four tumultuous years since Mr. Trump was elected.

Friendships have fractured. Workplace relationships have cooled. Family gatherings have been altered by fears that a request to pass the salt might somehow lead to a political brawl.

In Trump-solid Mercer County, Pa., a retired special education teacher named Beverly Graham, a Democrat, celebrated the big news on Saturday by pouring a glass of honey whiskey. She drank it in quiet toast, then tackled the chore of cleaning the bathrooms.

It has been a hard four years for Ms. Graham, with various political disagreements, including with sons who went from supporting Mr. Obama to supporting Mr. Trump. Especially difficult was the brutal mocking of Democrats — in other words, people like her — on social media by members of her church. Their disdain was so vitriolic that she had trouble attending Sunday services.

That is, when people used to go to church. Before the coronavirus.

“I just don’t think it’s ever going to be the same,” Ms. Graham, 65, said. “Because I felt like it was beyond political. It was personal.”

On the other side of Pennsylvania, 300 miles to the east in Monroe County, a cellphone salesman named Austin Garone said he was exhausted by the thought of telling an ex-girlfriend which way he had voted.

They had broken up in 2016 over politics, mostly, after he voted for Mr. Trump — a choice, he said, she found incomprehensible. This time around, she had been calling, texting and sending long Facebook missives, all to persuade him not to vote for Mr. Trump again.

“People just hate Trump so much,” Mr. Garone, 26, said. “It’s an emotional reaction and they lose their sense of reason.”

He said he had told his ex-girlfriend, still a close friend, that he would not vote for Mr. Trump if she could demonstrate that he had infringed upon her rights as a bisexual woman.

Mr. Garone ultimately decided that the president had not done so. But he is not volunteering that he voted for Mr. Trump in 2020.

“If she asks, I’ll tell her,” he said. “But if not, I won’t mention it.”

And in Louisville, Ky., a lawyer named Dustin Meek said that she had spent considerable time trying to navigate the political schism between herself, a self-described progressive Democrat, and her family in her Trump-supporting hometown of Ashland, 190 miles to the east.

“We’ll start out the evening saying, OK, no discussion of politics,” Ms. Meek, 54, said. “But inevitably, a joke will be thrown, or something will come up and people will poke, and honestly, I have to say, it has strained the relationships.”

“It’s hard,” she added.

She and her family members cannot seem to even agree on what constitutes “fact,” she said. They follow right-wing news websites, while she favors more traditional news sources that Mr. Trump has encouraged his followers to distrust.

Ms. Meek expressed hope that the less inflammatory rhetoric of a new president would ease things. And she said that she would not allow politics to get in the way of attending future family gatherings.

“Whether certain of my family members will elect to not attend certain events because my husband and I are there — that’s possible,” she said.

By Sunday morning, a semblance of serenity had returned to Maplewood. Mr. Kurland, a digital designer and a musician whose garage loudspeakers had rocked his neighborhood, mowed the lawn. His wife, Ms. Kumar, a psychologist, walked the family’s two black Labradors.

That the president of the United States was tweeting again about a stolen election did not perturb them. They had already danced for joy in their driveway.

‘It’s Such a Relief’: Biden Voters Rebuild a Wall That Trump Smashed,"

AMBLER, Pa. — Kristyn LaBarge was on a walk when she found out, not from a smartphone alert or a call from a friend but from the loud banging of pots that something significant had happened — that Joseph R. Biden Jr. had made Donald J. Trump a one-term president.

From San Francisco to New York to Washington, D.C., big Democratic cities were erupting with spontaneous street parties of singing, honking and dancing on Saturday. But in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which catapulted Mr. Trump to the presidency in 2016 and which Mr. Biden had just reclaimed, the celebrations seemed particularly sweet and personal. That was especially true in the leafy suburbs of Philadelphia, where huge Democratic margins had tipped the state that tipped the election.

“It was one of the most phenomenal moments of our lives,” said Ms. LaBarge, a 48-year-old mother of two boys and two girls. She rushed home to find that her son was already blasting the national anthem. In this most bitter of election’s wake, hearing Mr. Biden’s calming tone this week, she said, “was like this sweet music washing over me.”

“It just feels like,” she said, pausing and redirecting. “It’s such a relief.”

For Democrats, it has been an exhausting four years of Mr. Trump and tumult and tweets. Of travel bans and family separations. Of harsh words for Black leaders in the United States and warm ones for autocrats abroad. Of not one, not two, but three Supreme Court appointments. Of impeachment and acquittal.

And now, release and restoration.

In a year defined by the pandemic and its wrenching losses, many Democrats feel they just won something back: integrity in American democracy, pride in their country’s next leader and, more parochially, the “blue wall” of political power that the party long enjoyed in these three states. As defenders of free and fair elections urged the counting of every vote, voters in these three states knew it would be their ballots that carried the most weight.

When the news broke, Michael Jeske stepped into his yard in suburban Milwaukee and blasted a conch shell. Bjorn Hansen, a Republican in Kent County, Mich., who voted for Mr. Biden, received a text from Europe and pumped his fist. And Derrick McConnell of Detroit jumped up and shouted, “Thank you, Jesus!”

They cried. They danced. They smiled through masks. Many hugged.

“Covid be damned,” said Alison Duncan, who lives in a suburb of Pittsburgh. She was wearing torn pajamas when her neighbor came by in sweaty gym clothes. They embraced anyway. “It was beautiful,” she said.

Some people simply felt it was easier to breathe. The Trump era began for many Democrats with a sense of defeat and dread. It got worse: Charlottesville, the images of children in cages, the attacks on female members of Congress and women in power. And then it was about surviving the worst pandemic in a century, which triggered anxiety among Democrats that Mr. Trump was not taking the health risks seriously enough.

On Saturday, a new calm set in.

“I don’t think I need the Wellbutrin anymore — no more antidepressant for me,” said Ruth Briggs, 65, who was skipping down Arch Street in Philadelphia. “Four years of depression, just four years. It’s been horrible. And it’s lifted.”

In his first address to the nation as president-elect, Mr. Biden admitted his surprise at the spontaneous celebrations in the streets, which he called “an outpouring of joy, of hope, of renewed faith that tomorrow will bring a better day.”

An unseasonably warm day across much of the industrial Midwest and Pennsylvania, with bright sun and temperatures climbing into the 70s, only added to the sense of euphoria. People poured into the streets of downtown Philadelphia, the birthplace of American democracy and a city not known to not take credit (“Gritty Did It” read a homemade sign paying homage to the city’s, well, unique hockey mascot). They celebrated reclaiming a system of government that they believed had been fundamentally at risk.

“It felt like every half of every ’80s movie where the bullies are just winning and winning and winning, and you just don’t know if the world was the way you thought it was when you were a kid,” said Tom O’Connell, who, with his wife and three children, was among those downtown. “But it’s the second half now.”

If Mr. Biden were to carry the last two uncalled states where he is now leading, Georgia and Arizona, he would win exactly 306 Electoral College votes — the same number that Mr. Trump carried in 2016, which the president has long characterized as a “landslide.”

Still, the 2020 election results tell a more complicated story for Democrats than a simplified Hollywood script. Mr. Trump lost, but Republicans gained seats in the House and kept control of the Senate for now with runoff elections looming for two Senate seats in Georgia. And Democratic hopes to make gains in statehouses were mostly dashed. The margins were razor-thin even pre-election, though some polls had Democrats dreaming (Texas! Ohio! Iowa!) of an emphatic repudiation of Trumpism that did not arrive.

“Dance to your demise,” warned a sign held at a gathering of Trump supporters in Harrisburg, Pa. Similar pro-Trump demonstrators counterprogrammed Democratic celebrations in the capitals of Lansing, Mich., and Madison, Wis., a reminder of how divided the nation remains.

In Detroit, Hasan Beydoun, the owner of the Rafic’s On the Go food truck, said he was happy to contribute in a small way to the party with free cartons of chicken tenders, falafel and french fries, handed out to a hungry crowd of several hundred people.

Among them was Bruce Fealk, 67, who, at protests for the past four years, has been wearing a prison jumpsuit topped by a gigantic papier-mâche head made to resemble a snarling Donald Trump. Now he is planning a retirement ceremony for the 10-pound prop.

“On Jan. 20, no matter how cold it is, in the middle of a snowstorm, we’re going to have some kind of celebration,” said Mr. Fealk, who lives in the Detroit suburb of Rochester Hills. “And I’d like to burn it, in a bonfire would be good — maybe with some marshmallows.”

If defeat is an orphan, then Mr. Biden’s victory has many parents. Black voters in cities. College towns that turned out. Progressive enclaves that voted en masse. White suburban women who rejected Mr. Trump. White blue-collar workers who voted, even just ever so slightly, in greater numbers for Mr. Biden than they did for Hillary Clinton.

In Pennsylvania, the four suburban counties that ring Philadelphia netted Mr. Biden about 94,000 more votes than Mr. Trump, compared with Mr. Trump’s numbers against Hillary Clinton four years ago — enough to offset Mr. Trump’s entire margin of victory in 2016 and to account for his full deficit when the race was called in 2020.

“There is enough of us here to be the country others in the world believed we were before,” Julie Strauss, 65, who lives in Montgomery County, part of that suburban ring, said as she shopped at the local cooperative. She was heartened that the leaders of France and Canada had quickly weighed in to congratulate Mr. Biden. 

Of the Trump era, she reflected, “It’s disheartening to have discovered in this process it wasn’t the America I thought it was.”

But on Saturday, the nation made history as Senator Kamala Harris became the first woman and the first person of color to ascend to the vice presidency.

In a mostly Black area of North Philadelphia, Trevor Lewis, a 51-year-old construction contractor, voted for the first time this year. He wasn’t happy with Mr. Biden because of his past support for laws that imposed harsh sentences for minor crimes. But he came out to vote against Mr. Trump.

“When you’re Black, you know when somebody’s being racist,” he said. “He’s inciting groups like the Proud Boys and QAnon. Trump is a big kid with an ant farm and a magnifying glass, and we’re the ants.”

Balanced in the vote against the president, a uniquely energizing force, were voters who saw in Mr. Biden a sense of decency that they felt had been abandoned in White House.

“Thank God, America will be for the good of the people once again,’’ said Linda Gorski-Slear, 69, a retired dental hygienist in Washburn County, Wis. She said having a leader who would address the pandemic was urgent. “Biden cares about the people, not just going to the golf course on the weekend,’’ she said.

As it happened, when the race was called on Saturday, Mr. Trump was at his golf club in Northern Virginia, exactly the kind of suburban area his embracing of white grievance politics and cultural division has turned deeper blue. “Good riddance,” read one sign his motorcade passed.

Back in Ambler, Gina Donato, 46, said she had been crying a lot — first when Pennsylvania flipped and again when the presidential race was called. She had cried when Mr. Trump won, too, and it all felt just like things had come full circle.

“It was such a release,” she said. “Oh my God, this is the first time I’ve had hope in four years.”

The End of ‘America First’: How Biden Says He Will Re-engage With the World,"WASHINGTON — President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. makes no secret of the speed with which he plans to bury “America First” as a guiding principle of the nation’s foreign policy.

He says he will re-enter the Iran nuclear deal, assuming the Iranians are willing to reverse course and observe its limits.

He would sign up for another five years of the only surviving nuclear arms treaty with Russia and double down on American commitments to NATO after four years of threats from President Trump to withdraw from the alliance, which guided the West through the Cold War.

At the same time, Mr. Biden says he will make Russia “pay a price” for what he says have been disruptions and attempts to influence elections — including his own.

But mostly, Mr. Biden said in a statement to The New York Times, he wants to bring an end to a slogan that came to define a United States that built walls and made working with allies an afterthought — and, in Mr. Biden’s view, undermined any chance of forging a common international approach to fighting a pandemic that has cost more than 1.2 million lives.

“Tragically, the one place Donald Trump has made ‘America First’ is his failed response to the coronavirus: We’re 4 percent of the world’s population, yet have had 20 percent of the deaths,” Mr. Biden said days before the election. “On top of Trump embracing the world’s autocrats and poking his finger in the eye of our democratic allies, that’s another reason respect for American leadership is in free fall.”

But it is far easier to promise to return to the largely internationalist approach of the post-World War II era than it is to execute that shift after four years of global withdrawal and during a pandemic that has reinforced nationalist instincts. The world does not look remotely as it did when Mr. Biden last engaged it from the White House four years ago. Power vacuums have been created, and filled, often by China. Democracies have retreated. The race for a vaccine has created new rivalries.

So while foreign allies may find Mr. Biden reassuring — and smiled when they heard him say in a town-hall meeting that “‘America First’ has made America alone” — they also concede that they may never fully trust that the United States will not lurch back to building walls.

In interviews in the past several weeks, Mr. Biden’s top advisers began to outline a restoration that might be called the Great Undoing, an effort to reverse course on Mr. Trump’s aggressive attempt to withdraw to American borders.

“Whether we like it or not, the world simply does not organize itself,” said Antony J. Blinken, Mr. Biden’s longtime national security adviser. “Until the Trump administration, in Democratic and Republican administrations, the United States did a lot of that organizing, and we made some mistakes along the way, for sure.” Now, however, the United States has discovered what happens “when some other country tries to take our place or, maybe even worse, no one does, and you end up with a vacuum that is filled by bad events.”

Mr. Blinken acknowledged that for those allies — or opponents of Mr. Trump — looking to reset the clock to noon on Jan. 20, 2017, “it’s not going to happen.”

Those who have known Mr. Biden for decades say they expect him to move carefully, providing reassurance with a few big symbolic acts, starting with a return to the Paris climate accord in the first days of his administration. But substantive rebuilding of U.S. power will proceed far more slowly.

“He’ll inherit a situation which both gives him enormous latitude and, oddly, constrains him,” said Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a longtime friend of Mr. Biden’s. “Clearly, what Trump did by executive order can be undone by executive order.”

But “any act that requires Senate approach or any new use of force, absent a clear provocation, will be pretty much off the table,” he added.

At 77, Mr. Biden has his own back-to-the-future vision of how to dispense with “America First”: “This is the time to tap the strength and audacity that took us to victory in two world wars and brought down the Iron Curtain,” he wrote in Foreign Affairs in March.

Yet in a campaign in which foreign policy was rarely mentioned, Mr. Biden was never pressed on how the current iteration of superpower competition differs from what he remembers from early in his political career.

He never stated what kind of “price” he had in mind for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to pay, though one of his longtime foreign policy advisers, Jake Sullivan, offered a bit of detail. Just before Election Day, he said that Mr. Biden was willing to impose “substantial and lasting costs on perpetrators of the Russian interference,” which could include financial sanctions, asset freezes, counter cyberattacks and, “potentially, the exposure of corruption by the leaders of foreign countries.”

That would signify a hardening in U.S. policy. But it would also involve steps that the Obama administration considered taking in its last six months, when Mr. Biden was vice president, and never carried out.

The sharp change on Russia offers a glimpse of the detailed planning that Mr. Biden’s transition team, organized late last spring, has engaged in to reverse Mr. Trump’s approach to the world. It has built a foreign policy team of formal and informal advisers, largely drawn from midlevel and senior Obama administration officials who are poised to return. There are timelines for opening negotiations, re-entering treaties and early summit meetings.

But their plans show some notable breaks from the Obama administration’s strategy. Mr. Biden is clearly rethinking positions he took in the Senate and in the White House.

The most vivid example, officials say, will come in rethinking China strategy. His own advisers concede that in the Obama years, Mr. Biden and his national security team underestimated the speed with which President Xi Jinping of China would crack down on dissent at home and use the combination of its 5G networks and its Belt and Road Initiative to challenge U.S. influence.

“Neither carrots nor sticks have swayed China as predicted,” Kurt Campbell, who served as the assistant secretary of state for Asia, and Ely Ratner, one of Mr. Biden’s deputy national security advisers, wrote in a Foreign Affairs article in 2018 that reflected this shift. “Diplomatic and commercial engagement have not brought political and economic openness. Neither U.S. military power nor regional balancing has stopped Beijing from seeking to displace core components of the U.S.-led system.”

China is just one arena — though probably the most important — where Mr. Biden’s long-held views will come into first contact with new realities.

Robert M. Gates, the defense secretary who served both Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, described Mr. Biden as “impossible not to like” because he was “funny, profane and humorously self-aware of his motormouth.” But Mr. Gates also famously declared that Mr. Biden “has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.”

That assessment included Mr. Biden’s view on Afghanistan — where he argued, in the early days of the Obama administration in 2009, for a minimal force focused on a counterterrorism mission. Mr. Gates later recalled in his memoir that Mr. Biden was convinced that the military was trying to put the squeeze on the president to send more troops for a war the vice president thought was politically unsustainable.

Mr. Biden was overruled — by Mr. Obama, who nearly doubled the force size in Afghanistan in 2009 before moving to a drawdown.

But what was once a setback for Mr. Biden has now become something of a political asset: Mr. Trump’s effort to cast him as an advocate of “endless wars” fell flat. Mr. Biden, according to Mr. Sullivan, “wants to convert our presence to a counterterrorism capability” aimed at protecting the United States by keeping Qaeda forces or the Islamic State from establishing a base in Afghanistan.

“It would be limited and targeted,” Mr. Sullivan said. “That’s where he was in 2009, and that is where he is today.”

In the Cold War, Democrats were often portrayed as the party of appeasement to Moscow. Mr. Biden is the first Democrat to turn the tables: He is neither dismissive of the Russian threat as Mr. Obama was when he debated Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee in 2012, nor is he eager to bring a big red “reset” button to Moscow, as Hillary Clinton did in her opening days as secretary of state. 

In the campaign, Mr. Biden seized on the U.S. intelligence assessment that Russia preferred Mr. Trump, telling reporters in Nevada that “Putin knows me, and I know him, and he doesn’t want me to be president.” He is probably right: After details of the extent of Russian interference in 2016 became clear, followed by Mr. Trump’s unwillingness to confront Mr. Putin, Democrats have become the party of Russia hawks.

For most of the campaign, Mr. Biden assailed Mr. Trump for “cozying up to dictators” and describing how, if elected, he was prepared to punish Russia. As president, Mr. Biden will have to deal with a Russia whose arsenal includes 1,550 deployed nuclear weapons and a raft of tactical nuclear weapons that it has been deploying freely, even before Mr. Trump exited the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.

How would Mr. Biden end the downward spiral? He would start with a five-year extension of New START, Mr. Blinken said in an interview, since the treaty lapses 16 days after inauguration. Then he would seek to expand the treaty to other types of weapons and perhaps more countries. And he would play on Mr. Putin’s growing economic fragility.

“We will deter, and impose costs for, Mr. Putin’s meddling and aggression,” Mr. Blinken said. “But there’s a flip side” to dealing with Moscow, he added. Mr. Putin is “looking to relieve Russia’s growing dependence on China,” Mr. Blinken said, which has left him in “not a very comfortable position.”

That suggests the Biden administration could try to use the suspicions that Moscow and Beijing have of each other to split the two superpowers — just as President Richard M. Nixon used it, in reverse, to win his opening with China nearly 50 years ago.

“Oh, goddamn,” Mr. Biden fumed in the Situation Room in the summer of 2010, according to participants in the meeting, as news began to leak that a highly classified effort by the United States and Israel to destroy Iran’s nuclear program with a cyberweapon — later called “Stuxnet” — was about to be exposed because the computer code was being replicated around the world. “It’s got to be the Israelis. They went too far.”

A decade later, that effort to undermine the Iranian nuclear effort appears to be the birth of a new age of conflict, one in which Mr. Biden was a key player. He favored the covert effort because he was looking for any way to slow Iran’s progress without risking war in the Middle East. He later told colleagues that he believed the covert program helped bring the country to the negotiating table for what became the Iran nuclear deal five years later.

Now Mr. Biden says the first step with Iran is to restore the status quo — which means re-entering the deal if Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is willing to return to production limits announced in 2015. But it won’t be that simple. The Iranians have indicated there will be a higher price to pay for Mr. Trump’s breach. And some of the key restrictions on Iran begin to lift soon: The first phase of an arms embargo expired in October, clearing the way for the Russians and the Chinese to begin resuming sales. And there will soon be a new Iranian president, with unknown effects on potential talks.

Mr. Biden’s aides say that returning to the deal that Mr. Trump left “shifts the burden” back on Tehran.

“If Iran decides it’s not going to come back into compliance,” Mr. Blinken said, “we’re in a much stronger position to elicit support from allies and partners” who are now blaming Mr. Trump for starting the crisis by rejecting an agreement the United States had already made.

In 2012, Mr. Biden was the host when Mr. Xi came to Washington. The vice president praised the guest from Beijing as a rising reformer who was “prepared to show another side of the Chinese leadership.” Mr. Biden was among those to celebrate China’s inevitable but “peaceful rise,” followed by assurance that trying to contain its power was a fool’s errand.

By this year, he had revised his view. “This is a guy who is a thug,” Mr. Biden said.

So during the campaign, he went after Mr. Trump for “fake toughness” and argued that “Trump lost a trade war that he started.” What he meant was that the Trump-era tariffs on Chinese goods were ultimately underwritten by American taxpayers in the form of government subsidies to compensate farmers and others who lost sales.

Mr. Biden has said little about how he would push back. And even if he settles the long-running arguments over agricultural goods and the theft of intellectual property by Beijing, Mr. Biden will face challenges never discussed when Mr. Xi was visiting eight years ago: managing technological inroads by companies like Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, and TikTok, the app that has seized the imaginations and phones of 100 million Americans.

Mr. Biden has suggested that the Trump crackdowns may continue — though surrounded by more skillful diplomacy to bring European and other allies on board.

“God only knows what they’re doing with information they’re picking up off of here,” he said of the Chinese. “So as president, I will go into it very deeply. I’ll get the cyberexperts in with me to give me what is the best solution to deal with it.”

Complicating the issue is Mr. Biden’s insistence that, unlike Mr. Trump, he will put values back at the center of foreign policy, including how to approach the United States’ relationship with China, a milder echo of Bill Clinton’s pledge in the 1992 presidential race to take on “the butchers of Beijing.”

Presumably that means making China pay a price for Mr. Xi’s controls on dissent, including the national security laws that led to detention camps in Xinjiang, arrests of dissidents in Hong Kong and the ouster of foreign journalists who were the last bastion of independent reporting in China."
"Conor Lamb, House Moderate, on Biden’s Win, ‘the Squad’ and the Future of the Democratic Party","The carefully calibrated unity of the Democratic Party lasted about six months. After a summer when moderates and progressives joined together to elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. president, his victory has now given permission for the party to expend time and energy on the difficult task of sorting out its ideological core.

House Democrats, reeling from unexpected losses in competitive races, wasted no time. Moderates have blamed progressives for pushing policies such as “Medicare for all” and defunding the police, which are unpopular in swing districts.

But progressives, rallying to influence Mr. Biden on cabinet appointments and initial policy, have pushed back. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York has pinned those House losses on poor digital campaigning, saying members made themselves “sitting ducks” for Republicans.

Conor Lamb, the 36-year-old Pennsylvania Democrat who beat back a Republican challenge in a district that President Trump won in 2016, is one of those moderates who believes the left is costing Democrats in key areas. In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Lamb said he expected the incoming administration to govern as it had campaigned: with progressives at arm’s length.

This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.

Q. What’s your expectation of Joe Biden’s Democratic Party? How do you expect him to fall on the moderate vs. progressive divisions we see in the House?

A. I think that he means what he says when he says, “I ran a Democrat, but I’m going to serve as an American president.” And what that means, I believe, is that every single day, and on every issue, he’s going to be working to get as many people around the table and singing from the same sheet music as you can. And sometimes that will be everyone in the Democratic caucus. Sometimes it will be some people in the Democratic caucus and some Republicans. I think that’s going to change by the issue, but he’s a person that really believes our actual job in Washington, D.C., is to work with each other, compromise to get the best deal we can and then get the thing done. And I believe that too.

What went wrong for House Democrats when they were supposed to pick up seats?

I’m giving you an honest account of what I’m hearing from my own constituents, which is that they are extremely frustrated by the message of defunding the police and banning fracking. And I, as a Democrat, am just as frustrated. Because those things aren’t just unpopular, they’re completely unrealistic, and they aren’t going to happen. And they amount to false promises by the people that call for them.

If someone in your family makes their living in some way connected to natural gas, whether on the pipeline itself, or you know, even in a restaurant that serves natural gas workers, this isn’t something to joke around about or be casual about in your language.

That’s what we’re trying to say: that the rhetoric and the policies and all that stuff — it has gone way too far. It needs to be dialed back. It needs to be rooted in common sense, in reality, and yes, politics. Because we need districts like mine to stay in the majority and get something done for the people that we care about the most.

Let’s take that issue. Joe Biden did not support defunding the police. Almost all the members of the Democratic Congress, even folks like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, came out against it. What is the party supposed to do that it didn’t?

I think we can do it much more clearly and repetitively and show it with our actions. We need to have a unified Democratic message about good law enforcement and how to keep people safe, while addressing the systemic racism that I do believe exists and the racial inequities that absolutely do exist. And when we passed the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act, that’s exactly what we did.

But the people that I was on the phone with, when we were passing that at the time, were not the freshmen members who are criticizing us today. It was Karen Bass and Cedric Richmond and Colin Allred — and I was listening to them. And, you know, pretty much most of our moderate conservative Democrats all voted for that bill. We listened, we compromised and we got something done. And that’s what this job is really about.

Is it the view of moderate Democrats that the progressives or the so-called Squad has taken up too much space in the national conversation?

I wouldn’t put it that way. Because that really focuses on them as individuals and their personalities. And that is not what we’re trying to do. We’re trying to have a discussion about policy, not personality. And I want to be really clear on that, because I respect every one of those members and how hard they worked to get elected and how hard they have worked to stay elected and represent their constituencies. But the fact is that they and others are advocating policies that are unworkable and extremely unpopular.

So I would just say that our view is more that we want to have a clearer, sharper, more unified message on policy itself, regardless of who gets the credit or who is in the limelight for that.

In the Democratic primary, even as progressive candidates lost, polling showed that their issues remained popular among Democrats. Even things like single-payer health insurance or things like the Green New Deal. What’s your response to that?

At the end of the day, it’s individual candidates that have to win races, and then work with their fellow officeholders to pass bills into law and change people’s lives. So you can tell me all the polling you want, but you have to win elections.

And I’ve now been through three very difficult elections in a Republican-leaning district, with the president personally campaigning against me. And I can tell you that people are not clamoring for the two policies that you just asked about. So, that’s just what probably separates a winner from a loser in a district like mine.

On Saturday, I interviewed Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez and she mentioned you and how some House moderates ran their campaigns. I wanted to get a fact check quickly: Did you all spend just $2,000 on Facebook the week before the election?

She doesn’t have any idea how we ran our campaign, or what we spent, to be honest with you. So yeah, her statement was wrong. But there’s a deeper truth there, which is this — that our districts and our campaigns are extremely different. You know, I just leave it at that.

She said the way moderates ran their campaigns left them as “sitting ducks.” What was your reaction?

I have to be honest and say that I was surprised about the whole interview on the day when Vice President and now President-Elect Biden was having the election called for him. I just don’t think it was a day for people to be sniping at other members, especially in districts that are so different from their own.

I respect her and how hard she works. And what she did in an extremely low-turnout Democratic primary. But the fact is that in general elections in these districts — particularly in the ones where President Trump himself campaigns over and over and over again, and attacks members within their own Republican-leaning districts, like me and Representative Slotkin and Representative Spanberger — it’s the message that matters. It’s not a question of door knocking, or Facebook. It matters what policies you stand for, and which ones you don’t. And that is all that we are trying to say.

The American people just showed us in massive numbers, generally, which side of these issues that they are on. They sent us a Republican Senate and a Democratic president; we’re going have to do things that we can compromise over.

You mentioned sniping. Are progressives leading that or are moderates also doing so? I’m thinking of all the anonymous quotes attacking members of the left, something that she mentioned.

That’s just honestly a hard question to answer, because I don’t know who the anonymous people are. I believe we should put your name behind those types of comments and that’s generally what I do.

But I got to say, as you’ve talked a lot about Representative Ocasio-Cortez, she can put her name behind stuff and that’s I guess courageous, but when it’s a damaging idea or bad policy, like her tweeting out that fracking is bad in the middle of a presidential debate when we’re trying to win western Pennsylvania — that’s not being anything like a team player. And it’s honestly giving a false and ineffective promise to people that makes it very difficult to win the areas where President Trump is most popular in campaigns. 

You and Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez are on different sides of the ideological spectrum, but the same side of a generational divide among Democrats. House party leadership has said they plan to run again. Does there need to be more youth among Democratic leadership?

The most important thing is that the leadership we have has to listen to the newer, younger members and actually give us some input and help us get accomplishments at the policy level.

But what seems to happen sometimes is when push comes to shove, the younger members who have come from these really tough districts and tough races don’t always feel that the leadership takes our input as seriously as we would like. And I think that’s something they need to improve, and I would bet that Representative Ocasio-Cortez would feel similarly — even if it was on different issues."
A ‘Terrifying’ Coronavirus Surge Will Land in Biden’s Lap,"PITTSBURGH — Hours after President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. declared the coronavirus a top priority, the magnitude of his task became starkly clear on Sunday as the nation surpassed 10 million cases and sank deeper into the grip of what could become the worst chapter of the pandemic yet.

The rate of new cases is soaring, and for the first time is averaging more than 100,000 a day in the United States, which has reported more Covid-19 cases than any other country. An astonishing number — one in 441 Americans — have tested positive for the virus just in the last week.

With 29 states setting weekly case records, the virus is surging at a worrisome level in more than half the country. Nationwide, hospitalizations have nearly doubled since mid-September, and deaths are slowly increasing again, with few new interventions in place to stop the spiraling outbreak.

“We are in a terrifying place,” said Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, an assistant professor of medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina who studies pandemic response. “All I see is cases continuing to go up, unless we do something.”

The nation’s worsening Covid-19 outlook comes at an extremely difficult juncture: President Trump, who remains in control of the federal response to the outbreak for the next 73 days, is openly at odds with his own coronavirus advisers, and the country is heading into a cold winter when infections are only expected to spread faster as people spend more time indoors.

In a victory speech on Saturday night, Mr. Biden said he was quickly focusing his attention on the pandemic, including plans on Monday to announce a new task force of coronavirus advisers. But he faces a nation divided over mask rules and business shutdowns, even as experts say the situation may further deteriorate before the new administration takes over in late January.

At the White House, President Trump has largely shuttered the coronavirus task force, insisted without evidence that the nation is “rounding the corner” in the fight against the virus, and suggested that he might fire the nation’s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci. In the days before and after Election Day, six White House aides and a top campaign adviser tested positive for the virus.

All of it comes as colder weather in much of the nation will force people indoors, where the virus is known to spread more readily; as college semesters end and students return home; and as gatherings for Thanksgiving, Christmas and other holidays threaten to sow new outbreaks.

“I see this as a very precarious moment,” said Dr. Ashish K. Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, who said that the Trump administration had “basically thrown in the towel” on trying to control the pandemic, while Mr. Biden and his team have nothing to wield but “moral power and social power” until Jan. 20.

“Without significant action,” he said, “the idea that we have another 100,000 deaths by Inauguration Day would be a conservative estimate.”

Experts pointed to a number of steps a yet-to-be-sworn-in President-elect Biden could take to help control the pandemic. The options range from making a behind-the-scenes push for governors to issue mask orders and for Congress to supply more money for coronavirus testing, all the way up to a national lockdown if cases are still spiraling after Mr. Biden takes office.

Mr. Biden has said he wants to “shut down the virus, not the country.” But as he also vows to do “whatever it takes” to control the pandemic, the millions of Americans who turned out to vote in record numbers last week remain deeply split on how best to go about it.

“I’m anticipating the next shutdown,” said Voizene Stewart, 53, of Detroit, who said he voted for Mr. Biden after losing both his mother and his 34-year-old son to the coronavirus. Though virus cases in the county that includes Detroit are below peak levels from this spring, they have been rising steadily, with nearly 500 infections a day reported on average over the last week.

Even though he has gone months without spending significant time with his remaining children and grandchildren, he said he hopes that the president-elect will once again restrict businesses and urge people to stay home. “We need to get back to that,” he said. “They opened too early.” He noted with concern that the grocery store across the street from his home, which used to be quiet, was once again bustling with people; many customers emerging from the store on Sunday were wearing masks.

Many other voters, including those who viewed Mr. Trump as a champion of the economy, remain far from persuaded.

“We’ve already suffered almost irreparable damage from closing things down,” said Dennis Rohr, a city commissioner in Mandan, N.D., who said he voted for Mr. Trump. Though case counts remain extremely high in Mandan and across North Dakota, Mr. Rohr, 77, feared that any type of shutdown would bring a new, even more dangerous slew of problems, including job losses and loneliness.

Nine months into the pandemic, the country is fading from exhaustion and impatience, but the virus is spreading more than ever before.

Unlike in the spring, when the virus devastated New York City and other places on the East and West Coasts, it is now spreading nearly everywhere, with infections rising in 46 states.

In Pennsylvania, the state that gave Mr. Biden the electoral votes he needed to clinch the presidency, more people are testing positive for the coronavirus than at any other time in the pandemic. In Wisconsin, another pivotal state, hospitalizations for the virus have skyrocketed 500 percent in the past two months.

Surges have hit communities of all types, with remote counties and urban centers alike seeing major spikes. In rural Norton County, Kan., which has lately had one of the country’s highest infection rates, every resident of a local nursing home has tested positive, as have hundreds of people in prison. In Cook County, Ill., which includes Chicago, more than 4,600 cases were announced on Saturday.

Though the country is conducting far more tests now than it was in the spring, the soaring case numbers now reflect accelerating spread of the virus, not simply wider testing.

Hospitalizations, which give a clear picture of how many people are seriously ill with the virus at any given time, grew by 63 percent over the past month, according to data collected by the Covid Tracking Project. More than 55,000 people are now hospitalized with the virus, approaching earlier peaks of more than 59,000 in April and July.

Treatment has vastly improved since the height of the spring outbreak, when more than 2,200 people were dying per day. Even so, deaths, which tend to lag a few weeks behind new infections, are now trending upward. The country has averaged about 900 deaths a day over the last week, compared with about 700 a month ago.

Mr. Biden is in line to inherit one of the most serious and complicated national crises that any incoming president in more than half a century has faced.

While other presidents have entered office during an economic slowdown, including President Obama and Mr. Biden as vice president in 2009, not since Harry Truman in the final months of World War II has a new president faced a situation as “complex and multiheaded” as the pandemic, said Bruce J. Schulman, a political historian at Boston University.

Mr. Biden has said controlling the pandemic is the necessary first step to bringing back jobs, and has said that on his first day in office, he would move rapidly to appoint a “national supply chain commander” and establish a “pandemic testing board,” similar to Franklin D. Roosevelt’s wartime production panel.

On Sunday, Mr. Biden’s campaign released a first glimpse of his plan for the pandemic, including a commitment to “listen to science.” Public health experts offered initial praise for his coronavirus task force, which is expected to include Dr. Vivek Murthy, a former surgeon general; Dr. David Kessler, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration; and Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, a Yale University professor.

But Mr. Biden has also promised to unify the country and govern as an “American president,” and millions of Americans, including many who supported Mr. Trump, voted with priority on the economy.

Kathleen Skeins, a travel agent outside Detroit, used to be busy planning all-inclusive trips abroad for her clients. Now, she said, she is among the many business owners in America who are “barely starting to get back on their feet.”

“We’ve already had so many people that have lost their dreams in the first shutdown,” said Ms. Skeins, 51, who said she cast her first ballot in about 30 years last week, and voted for Mr. Trump. While she doesn’t take the virus lightly, she said, she remains firmly opposed to any restrictions that could hurt her business.

“The virus is never going to go away,” she said. “It’s just a part of our lives.”

"A Nation Votes for Joe Biden, and a Red State Shrugs","YUTAN, Neb. — In the moments after the presidential vote tally made it clear that Joseph R. Biden Jr. had won the election on Saturday, a teenager wheeled a broken lawn mower across an empty downtown street here. Wispy white clouds blew across the sky. Inside the Rusty Rooster Saloon, a man with gray hair took a swig from a Bud Light can, and the only result that interested anyone was the outcome of the college football game on the television.

Amber Thiessen was gassing up her new pickup truck at a filling station on the edge of town, a Republican stronghold just like the overwhelming majority of the state. She voted for President Trump and thinks Mr. Biden and other Democrats like Hillary Clinton are “snakes in the grass.”

“A lot of people, when this happened for Trump in 2016, they started saying ‘not my president,’” she said. “He has never been given the opportunity to show how much he loves the country because of these ‘not my president’ people.”

Ms. Thiessen is unhappy that her candidate didn’t win. But she has no plans to say Mr. Biden isn’t her president. Because she knows that once he is sworn in, he will be, regardless of whether she likes it.

The 2020 presidential vote hammered home the political divide in the country, with states supporting Mr. Biden largely located along the coasts, and those supporting Mr. Trump in a swath down the middle. Nebraska is tucked deep among them. More than 90 percent of voters supported Mr. Trump in at least five of its 93 counties.

But the knowledge here that Mr. Biden won the presidency — and that Nebraska even sent an Electoral College vote his way — was met with a what-goes-around-comes-around kind of attitude. Many Republicans said they planned to show liberals, who they said had whined for four years about Mr. Trump, that it was possible to simply move on when you lose.

“In America, you get four years and you can do it again,” Ms. Thiessen said.

Throughout the week, a little blue dot glowed on the map of results in an otherwise red sea, showing Nebraska’s single electoral vote for Mr. Biden. And in some ways, that dot could make it easier to accept the results, regardless of party affiliation. Without a winner-take-all system, the state is not taken entirely for granted, and that can make the whole endeavor feel less futile.

Nebraska is one of two states that splits its electoral votes; the other is Maine, and State Sen. Ernie Chambers, an independent who spent the early years of his long political career as the only Black lawmaker in the Nebraska legislature, has fought to keep that split-vote system on the books.

“I couldn’t see in advance it would have any significant outcome in the race for president,” said Mr. Chambers, who represents parts of the district in Omaha, which has the state’s largest population of Black residents. “Had I not fought like I did, the votes and attitudes of the people of the Second District would have been insignificant.”

Yutan, population 1,300, is just over the border from the Second Congressional District, but a long leap as far as its politics go. Seventy-one percent of voters in Saunders County, where Yutan is, cast ballots for Mr. Trump.

It has the trappings of many rural Nebraska small towns: an overwhelmingly white population, grain bins alongside railroad tracks, a water tower, a short strip of stores both open and long-ago shuttered, and roads that dead-end into cornfields.

Ms. Thiessen lives in Valley, Neb., just inside the western edge of the Second District, but was raised in Yutan, where she visits her parents regularly and shares the political views of her hometown. She was annoyed by the attention received by the Second District, even if that is her district. Still, she remains focused on moving on.

Not all of Mr. Trump’s backers in Nebraska were brushing off the latest voting results. In Lincoln, supporters rallied outside the capitol yelling that Mr. Biden had stolen the election. In Yutan, some expressed worries about trade and the economy under Mr. Biden. One woman stood in her lawn and said she was waiting once Mr. Biden took office “for my government-issued Chinese flag.” Her neighbor worried about socialism taking root. Both were worried that if they gave their names to a reporter, liberals would track them down and destroy their homes.

For many Nebraskans in rural areas, seeing that blue dot on the map stung. The neglect they feel by the rest of the country, and even by the cities in their own state, has fueled their politics, they said.

“Out here in rural America, nobody else is going to do it for me. I have to do it myself,” said Ann Neiffer, who owns Tall Tails Taxidermy, in Cherry County, where more than 87 percent of voters, including her, cast ballots for Mr. Trump. “Because life comes so hard here, the Republican ideal is what we have. It’s kind of me, myself and I.”

The pandemic shut down Ms. Neiffer’s operation for two months earlier this year and the economic fallout is the reason she believes customers have not picked up and paid for 33 deer, a bison, an elk, a beaver and two bobcats. She worries a Biden administration will further hurt her business by cracking down on gun sales that could affect hunting.

Tucker Sheets, the owner of Cowboy Welding, in Hyannis, Neb., is worried about a Biden administration limiting his Second Amendment rights, and has a host of other concerns about the next four years.

“We want our tax breaks. We want our guns. We don’t want our money going to social programs,” said Mr. Sheets, who voted for Mr. Trump. “We all work hard out here. There isn’t a lot of money to go around in this rural area.”

Just 20 people voted for Mr. Biden in Grant County, where Cowboy Welding is, “and I have a pretty good idea of who a few of them are. There definitely aren’t 20 signs out in yards.” Like a handful of other rural counties, Grant also rejected a ballot measure that would have stricken an old provision that allowed slavery to be used as punishment, though the measure overall passed.

Mr. Sheets said Biden voters were unhappy with Mr. Trump in much the same way he predicted he would be unhappy with a President Biden. But he is anticipating one key difference.

“In the 2016 election after Trump won, we got nothing but crying and whining and trying to get rid of him for four years. I don’t want to do that. I want to move on and keep going.”

Or, put another way: “No one died because of hating Trump,” he said. “And I won’t die from not liking Biden.”

Inside the Cattleman’s Lounge in Springview, Neb., signs supporting Mr. Trump decorate the restaurant.

Joleen Kienke, the owner, said she had voted for Mr. Trump because the president opposed the shutdown of the nation’s economy during the pandemic. Cases of Covid-19 are surging across Nebraska, but the effects of the virus aren’t as obvious in Keya Paha County, home to fewer than 300 residents, where Springview is.

Ms. Kienke said the income from the lounge and her Cattleman’s Bunkhouse had increased in recent months.

“I hear a lot of restaurants are going under, but we’re doing pretty good,” said Ms. Kienke, a fifth-generation cattle rancher whose ancestors immigrated from Germany. “There’s very little Covid here, and people who do have it stay home.”

She is hosting two Italian and French exchange students, and during the Halloween season took them to corn mazes and haunted houses. She said the students sent photos to their friends back home who were quarantining, bragging about how open America was in comparison.

Ms. Kienke, like nearly everyone else in the county, is a Republican. She said that if Mr. Trump had won the election, Democrats would have rioted. But she predicted Mr. Trump’s supporters would stand down and accept a Biden victory.

“I don’t think they’re going to shoot up the towns,” she said.

When Craig Softley realized last week that the presidential vote was swinging Mr. Biden’s way, his thoughts turned to a divided nation. Not just the kind of political division that has fractured much of America, but literal, maybe-it’s-time-we-cleave-this-country-into-two-nations kind of division. He was thinking of secession.

“Is there a point that this country becomes actually split?” he said he thought as he watched the vote tallies from around the country.

Mr. Softley, a Republican, lives in Hayes County, where nearly 93 percent of voters supported Mr. Trump and which was named for the 19th U.S. president, Rutherford B. Hayes, who won an election by just one Electoral College vote.

But as he watched the counting progress, Mr. Softley’s thinking evolved. He is a volunteer firefighter, drives an ambulance, helps on a ranch, started a consulting business, serves as the county’s economic development coordinator and helped found a church, where he is trying to grow the congregation. Most days he starts his workday at 3:50 a.m.

“By Wednesday morning or midday, it looked like a pretty strong possibility it was going to be Biden, and you just resign yourself to the fact,” he said. “You’ve got to keep working, just got to move on.”"
"In a Divided Washington, Biden Could Still Exert Economic Power","WASHINGTON — President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. will take office in January with a weak economy weighed down by the resurgence of the coronavirus, millions of Americans still unemployed and businesses struggling and shuttering as winter bears down.

Addressing that economic challenge and following through on his campaign’s tax and spending promises could be complicated if Republicans maintain control of the Senate.

But as President Trump has demonstrated time and again, Mr. Biden has the power to pull some levers unilaterally, without congressional approval, and could influence the federal government’s economic policymaking machinery through an array of executive actions, regulations and personnel changes.

“There’s a tremendous amount that can be done without Congress,” said Felicia Wong, who serves as an adviser on the Biden transition board but who was speaking in her capacity as head of the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank.

From finding ways to stimulate the economy to changing trade rules to tinkering with corporate taxation, here are some of the ways a Biden presidency could unilaterally influence economic policy.

In the run-up to to the election, Mr. Trump saw the limits of the White House’s ability to jump-start the economy without Congress. He repurposed some federal funds to temporarily extend expanded unemployment insurance and allowed companies to defer collection of workers’ payroll taxes but found his hands largely tied beyond those measures. Economists and political advisers say Mr. Biden could seek other creative approaches if a Republican Senate blocks the kind of big spending package that Democrats have been pushing.

That includes providing student debt relief, which Ms. Wong said would work as a sort of stimulus by removing the burden of those payments. Mr. Biden could direct the Education secretary to forgive student loans up to a certain amount — Ms. Wong would favor as much as $50,000 to $75,000 for low- and moderate-income households. That move, she said, would strongly benefit workers from minority racial and ethnic groups.

The administration could also use executive authority to raise the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 an hour, she said, providing a pay boost for many thousands of workers.

Mr. Biden will be able to exert some additional oversight over the $2.2 trillion stimulus package that passed in March. For instance, small businesses that took Paycheck Protection Program loans were required to keep workers on payrolls, and he could instruct his Treasury Department to more rigorously scrutinize the loans to ensure that the money was actually going to pay salaries and overhead costs.

Mr. Biden could also take a page from Mr. Trump and seek to repurpose unspent funds from that stimulus legislation, including hundreds of billions of dollars that were earmarked for the Paycheck Protection Program but never allocated before a congressional deadline ended the program. He could also lean on the Treasury to make lending facilities established by the Federal Reserve more generous and attractive to users, if they haven’t expired by the time he enters office.

Mr. Biden proposed trillions of dollars of tax increases on high earners and corporations in his campaign. Much of that agenda would require cooperation from Congress, but in a few areas, a Biden administration could act on its own to raise taxes — largely by changing regulations governing how Mr. Trump’s signature 2017 tax law is carried out.

Several of those regulations apply to income earned abroad by multinational corporations that operate in the United States. A Biden Treasury Department could move to reverse a series of decisions that Mr. Trump’s team made after the 2017 law was passed that effectively reduced the liability of multinationals under a pair of new taxes created by the law, known as the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax and the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income.

Mr. Biden campaigned on a promise to raise U.S. tax liability on multinationals’ global income, which he could attempt to do via regulation by changing how the liability is calculated. His Treasury Department could also attempt to roll back a so-called high-tax exemption, which allowed some companies to lower their tax bills in the United States.

A Biden Treasury could also change the regulations covering Opportunity Zones, another creation of the 2017 law that is intended to entice investment in high-poverty areas by providing a tax break. Such changes could make it more difficult for investors to qualify for the tax benefits from the zones, and Treasury could impose more stringent reporting requirements on projects that qualify for the breaks.

As Mr. Trump has shown, the executive branch has a great deal of latitude when it comes to trade policy.

Mr. Biden will face several trade decisions in the short term, including whether to continue with Mr. Trump’s ban on TikTok and WeChat, the popular social media apps, and whether to retain America’s tariffs on Chinese goods and foreign metals.

Mr. Biden would not need congressional approval to deal with these and other outstanding trade issues — including how to resolve a spat with the European Union over subsidies given to Boeing and Airbus, how to resolve global negotiations over digital services taxes and whether to follow through on Mr. Trump’s plans to place new tariffs on Vietnam.

“The administration would want to keep Congress in the loop, but they have a lot of discretion to shift away from Trump’s policies,” said Simon Lester, a trade policy expert at the Cato Institute.

Mr. Biden will also have broad scope to stake out his position on America’s economic relations with China, including whether to continue limiting U.S. exports of sensitive technology like artificial intelligence and robotics. And the next president will also have to decide whether to pursue additional sanctions for human rights violations in the Chinese region of Xinjiang and whether to continue trying to block Chinese investment in the United States.

Congressional approval would be needed if Mr. Biden wanted to pass any free trade deals. But his advisers have said that they are unlikely to pursue any new agreements in the short term, instead focusing on domestic priorities.

Some of Mr. Biden’s other priorities on trade transcend party lines and could gain support among congressional Republicans — like strengthening Buy American rules to devote more federal dollars to American products, or investing in domestic technologies like semiconductors to ensure that China does not gain a competitive edge.

Some of the biggest Trump-era changes to bank regulation have been done through the regulatory agencies, rather than through Congress. Examples include a weakening of the Volcker Rule, which keeps banks from betting for their own profit, and a reworking of the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to invest in poor communities.

A new crew of regulatory officials will have leeway to either undo those tweaks or to impose new ones — which will probably cut toward stronger oversight. Much like the slow drip of deregulation under the Trump administration, any changes coming out of the Fed and its fellow regulatory agencies are likely to be small and steady.

“It is going to be a tough slog for the Democrats on the legislative front,” said Ian Katz, a director and financial policy analyst at Capital Alpha Partners. “The action is really with the regulators.”

But changes may not come that quickly, even if Mr. Biden taps more pro-regulatory officials for the various agencies. One of the most powerful regulatory positions — the Fed’s vice chair for supervision — is held by Randal K. Quarles, a Trump appointee whose term is not up until October 2021.

One area to keep an eye on is climate finance: The independent Fed has been slow to embrace climate stress tests, or to publicly examine how its own policies might take into account climate concerns, against a political backdrop in which climate-related measures seemed overtly political. That could change in the next four years.

A Biden administration could exert huge influence over consumer protections, including those involving debt collection, payday lending and foreclosure abuse.

The Supreme Court ruled in June that the White House has the power to fire the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau without cause, rejecting a federal law that sought to place limits on presidential oversight of independent agencies. That means Mr. Biden will be free to replace Kathleen Kraninger, the bureau’s current director, with someone who will more rigorously scrutinize businesses and ramp up enforcement.

Mr. Katz pointed to payday lending regulation and a debt collection rule at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as things that could be on the table quickly.

Richard Cordray, the bureau’s former director, said in a white paper earlier this year that the it should be taking action to help people avoid foreclosure and eviction during the pandemic and be carefully monitoring the practices of debt collectors.

“The C.F.P.B. should make sure companies are complying with all emergency protections on the books, and maximizing assistance to consumers to prevent garnishments, foreclosures and repossessions,” said Linda Jun, senior policy counsel at Americans for Financial Reform."
Where Does Joe Biden Stand on Major Policies?,"Progressives think President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s policies do not go far enough. President Trump and his administration have called Mr. Biden a Trojan horse for the radical left.

Since the primary, Mr. Biden has shifted leftward on issues including health care, climate change and education. But even then, he has hardly embraced the bold agenda of progressives like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

Here is where Mr. Biden actually stands on several key issues: the coronavirus, health care, the economy, taxes and climate change.

Mr. Biden made combating the pandemic a central message of his campaign for months, arguing that the nation would be better off if he were in charge.

His plans for addressing the outbreak include improved testing, expanded production of personal protective equipment, safe vaccine development and the safe reopening of schools. He has vowed to do “whatever it takes” to stop the pandemic from continuing to spread across the country, including lockdowns if scientists recommend them.

Mr. Biden has also said he will ask governors to institute a mask mandate in their states; if they refuse, he will work with local officials to get mandates in place. And he has said he will impose a national mask mandate in federal buildings and on interstate transportation.

As for Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, Mr. Biden says that he hopes Dr. Fauci will also serve in his administration.

Mr. Biden supports expanding the Affordable Care Act and creating a public option — a plan he has nicknamed Bidencare. He has denounced Republican efforts to overturn the health care law, and vowed to ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions will continue to have access to health care.

He does not support the universal, single-payer health care proposal known as “Medicare for all” that is advocated by progressives including Mr. Sanders. And he does not support eliminating private insurance. But in a concession to progressives, he announced in April a plan to lower the Medicare eligibility age to 60 from 65.

Mr. Biden has also pledged to “reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there’s competition that doesn’t exist now by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies.”

Mr. Biden has a sweeping economic recovery plan, under the moniker “Build Back Better,” that promises to create millions of job. In his plan, Mr. Biden has tied the economic revival to tackling climate change, racial equity and reinvestment in American manufacturing.

Among his proposals are a $300 billion increase in government spending on research and development of technologies, like electric vehicles and 5G cellular networks, and an additional $400 billion in federal procurement spending on products that are manufactured in the United States.

To discourage American companies from moving jobs to other countries, known as offshoring, he proposed a 10 percent “offshoring penalty surtax” that would apply to “profits of any production by a United States company overseas for sales back to the United States.”

Mr. Biden has also said he will change the tax code to reward companies for investing in domestic production. And he has promised to take executive action to ensure the purchase of American goods in the federal procurement process.

Mr. Biden wants to partially repeal the Trump tax overhaul, rolling back tax cuts for corporations and the highest earners. He has proposed increasing the corporate tax rate to 28 percent, from 21 percent.

But he has said that he will keep tax cuts in place for other households, including those in the middle class, and he has promised that no one making under $400,000 will pay higher taxes.

Over all, Mr. Biden’s proposals would increase tax revenue by an estimated $3.4 trillion over a decade, according to an analysis by the Penn Wharton Budget Model at the University of Pennsylvania. Eighty percent of the increase would fall on the top 1 percent, according to the analysis.

As a result of lower wages and investment returns, the Penn Wharton analysis found that the after-tax income of households earning under $400,000 would decrease by 0.9 percent on average. But there would be a far steeper average drop in after-tax income for households earning above $400,000: 17.7 percent.

The Biden campaign has argued that the Penn Wharton analysis presents an incomplete picture because it does not take into account a number of tax-related proposals put forth by the campaign that it says will benefit those in the middle-class.

Mr. Biden laid out a plan over the summer to spend $2 trillion to develop clean energy and eliminate emissions from the power sector by 2035. In addition to the coronavirus pandemic, the resulting economic crisis and racial injustice, he has referred to climate change as one of four “historic crises” that the United States is facing.

But notably, he has declined to support the Green New Deal, a sweeping climate plan embraced by progressive groups and criticized by Republicans, though his website calls it a “crucial framework.”

And while Mr. Trump has accused Mr. Biden of wanting to “ban fracking,” Mr. Biden has repeatedly said he will not do so. Instead, he has proposed ending the permitting of new fracking on federal lands, but he is not proposing a national ban.

During the last presidential debate, Mr. Biden also said he would push the country to “transition away from the oil industry” and end federal subsidies. He later tried to clarify his remarks saying, “We’re getting rid of the subsidies for fossil fuels, but we’re not getting rid of fossil fuels for a long time.”"
What’s Next for Trump? The Family Business Awaits His Return,"President Trump’s tax records show signs of financial distress, he claims to have lost out on billions of dollars in income while in office and his eldest sons say the family business has forfeited dozens of potential deals across the globe.

Now, denied a second term by voters, Mr. Trump may seek to return to a once-lucrative career in television, this time with a decidedly political bent. His family business will also be free to make up for lost time by once again looking overseas, where hotels and golf clubs helped drive its growth before his election in 2016.

Eric Trump and a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization did not respond on Saturday to requests for comment on the business’s post-White-House plans. The president put out a statement disputing the outcome of the election, indicating that he did not believe he had lost.

[Update Nov. 9, 2020: Representatives of the Trump Organization sent The Times a response from Eric Trump on Monday that emphasized the company’s strengths. “We’ve made tremendous sacrifices over the past several years, faced more scrutiny than one could ever imagine and yet we remain at the top of our game,” he said.]

After winning the presidency four years ago, Mr. Trump declined to sell off his stake in the Trump Organization, and instead adopted a plan that he said would eliminate conflicts of interest. Among other things, the Trump Organization pledged to forgo new deals outside the United States and hired an ethics adviser to screen certain domestic ventures.

Democrats and others argued that the restrictions were half-measures at best, and indeed the approach did little to prevent the president from turning his resorts and hotels into a hub of favor seeking for lobbyists, donors and corporate chiefs, as The New York Times reported in October.

Still, the presidency took a toll on the privately owned family business, which has not closed a new hotel deal since Mr. Trump entered the White House. The company shelved a proposed chain of budget-friendly hotels last year, and Mr. Trump’s financial disclosure statements showed that his top cash-generating properties had largely gone sideways. Without offering evidence, Mr. Trump claimed last year that being president was “probably costing me from $3 to $5 billion.”

The ban on new foreign deals probably dealt the biggest blow. Before the presidency, the company was eyeing a major expansion in China; it would even maintain a Chinese bank account and keep an inactive office in Shanghai during the presidency. It had also done exploratory work on new business partnerships in Colombia, Brazil and Turkey.

No longer constrained by its self-imposed ethics plan, the Trump Organization is now expected to seek hotel deals and other business, according to several people close to the company. Even so, there will be numerous obstacles to a rebound, including the coronavirus pandemic, law enforcement investigations into the company and a deeply divided view of Mr. Trump among the American public. Additionally, if Mr. Trump made another run for the White House in 2024, he might need to avoid new foreign entanglements that could provide ammunition for political rivals.

As Mr. Trump is poised to once again become a private citizen, here is the landscape for his family business.

The fastest way for the Trump Organization to raise money is to flip the switch on its international deal machine, licensing the Trump name to real estate projects like hotels and residential towers.

When Mr. Trump entered the White House in 2017, Trump Organization executives said the company had left behind more than two dozen such branding deals, including in China, Israel and across South America. As Mr. Trump leaves office, he is popular in some countries, and his brand is widely recognized.

The branding deals are largely risk-free for the company because they do not require capital investments and generally make between $500,000 and $1 million a year, at least initially. The payments often decline after units in residential buildings are sold, unless the Trump Organization makes parallel agreements to manage the properties.

While Congress may no longer be as focused on Mr. Trump’s business activities, prosecutors in New York will continue their investigations.

The Manhattan district attorney’s office is investigating Mr. Trump and his company for an array of potential financial crimes and is seeking his tax returns. The New York State attorney general’s office is conducting a separate civil inquiry into suspicions that the company misstated its assets, possibly to reduce taxes or obtain loans.

The company has denied any wrongdoing, but it may be reluctant to provide the investigators with additional deals to scrutinize. Eric Trump, who runs the company with his brother Donald Jr., last year cited scrutiny from Democrats and the media as a major reason for suspending plans to open a new line of hotels.

The investigations could also lead to negative publicity as the company is looking to expand.

Over the past four years, Bobby R. Burchfield, a Washington lawyer, served as the Trump Organization’s ethics adviser, scrutinizing potential deals and business partners. The examinations made it difficult for some to pass muster, while others were scared off by the public attention.

That scrutiny will now fall away, opening a pipeline of new partners.

And with more than $300 million in debt coming due that the president has personally guaranteed, there may be some urgency for the Trump Organization to line up new deals. In addition, an adverse ruling in an audit battle with the Internal Revenue Service could cost him more than $100 million, The Times reported in September.

Some of Mr. Trump’s most lucrative properties are in Democratic strongholds, like New York and Chicago, where he remains deeply unpopular. And his biggest revenue-generator, his Doral golf resort in Florida, has suffered from a drop-off in conference revenue as some big companies and organizations stayed away because of his divisiveness.

As president, Mr. Trump has tried to fill the gap, at least in part, through events booked at his properties by groups connected to him and Republican politics. The Trump International Hotel near the White House was often brimming with partisan allies.

It is unclear if that patronage will continue, or if Mr. Trump’s detractors will return to his properties once he leaves office. Additionally, it has been a tough year for the hospitality industry because of the pandemic, and the headwinds have hit commercial real estate, too. Both are central to Mr. Trump’s business portfolio.

Mr. Trump, as of late, has privately raised the idea of running again in 2024. And the possibility of another Trump presidential run could have a chilling effect on his business in the intervening years, at least in countries like China, where a thicket of ethical and legal conflicts could arise.

The president also may not be the last Trump to run for elected office.

Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump may hold future political aspirations, and that could curb some plans for growth. The risks are greatest on the international front, where potential for conflicts of interest abound.

During his time in the White House, Mr. Trump put his eldest sons in charge of his company along with a team of other executives. But even before that, he had receded somewhat from scouting deals, letting his children take the lead.

Where and how Mr. Trump will reassert himself in the family business will be one of the intriguing questions surrounding his return to private life. A onetime reality TV star, he may instead return to television as a political pundit or in another role, those around him say.

There have been preliminary discussions about acquiring or starting a Trump-branded network, for example. His work on “The Apprentice,” tax records show, brought him new sources of cash and furthered a myth that would help propel him to the White House, The Times reported in September. Paid speeches and a book deal could also await him.

"As Biden Plans Transition, Republicans Decline to Recognize His Election","WASHINGTON — President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. prepared on Sunday to start building his administration, even as Republican leaders and scores of party lawmakers refrained from acknowledging his victory out of apparent deference to President Trump, who continued to refuse to concede.

With Mr. Biden out of the public eye as he received congratulations from leaders around the world, his team turned its attention to a transition that will swing into action on Monday, with the launch of a coronavirus task force and swift moves to begin assembling his team.

But more than 24 hours after his election had been declared, the vast majority of Republicans declined to offer the customary statements of good will for the victor that have been standard after American presidential contests, as Mr. Trump defied the results and vowed to forge ahead with long-shot lawsuits to try to overturn them.

While some prominent Republican figures, including the party’s only living former president, George W. Bush, called Mr. Biden to wish him well, most elected officials stayed silent in the face of Mr. Trump’s baseless claims that the election was stolen from him.

Mr. Biden did not respond to Mr. Trump’s attacks on the result, but he also was not waiting for a concession. On Sunday, he unveiled his official transition website as he prepared a series of executive actions for his first day in the Oval Office — including rejoining the Paris climate accord, moving aggressively to confront the coronavirus pandemic and restoring labor organizing rights for government workers — aimed at unwinding Mr. Trump’s domestic agenda and repairing the United States’ image in the world.

But Republicans’ silence suggested that even in defeat, Mr. Trump maintained a powerful grip on his party and its elected leaders, who have spent four years tightly embracing him or quietly working to avoid offending him or his loyal base. For many prominent Republicans, the president’s reluctance to accept the election results created a dilemma, making even the most cursory expression of support for Mr. Biden seem like a conspicuous break with Mr. Trump.

Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri was the most senior Republican to suggest that Mr. Trump had most likely lost and cast doubt on his allegations of a stolen election, but he stopped short of referring to Mr. Biden as the president-elect in an exceedingly careful television interview.

“It’s time for the president’s lawyers to present the facts, and it’s time for those facts to speak for themselves,” Mr. Blunt, the chairman of the Rules Committee, said on ABC’s “This Week.” “It seems unlikely that any changes could be big enough to make a difference, but this is a close election, and we need to acknowledge that.”

“I look forward,” Mr. Blunt added, “to the president dealing with this however he needs to deal with it.”

At the White House, there was little indication that Mr. Trump was dealing with it at all. As he played a second consecutive day of golf at his private club outside Washington, the president recirculated a groundless claim by Newt Gingrich, the former Republican speaker of the House, who told Fox News, “I think that it is a corrupt, stolen election.”

Privately, the president’s advisers, several of whom have quietly been candid with Mr. Trump that the chances of success in any challenge to the election outcome were not high, had concluded they had little option other than to allow the president to keep fighting until he was ready to bow to the reality of his loss.

On Friday, a large group of them met with the president in the Oval Office to discuss the way forward, giving him a brutally honest assessment of his likelihood of prevailing. After another meeting at Mr. Trump’s campaign headquarters on Saturday, where political aides again laid out the small chances of changing the outcome of the race, Jared Kushner, the president’s senior adviser and son-in-law, asked the group to go to the White House to outline it for Mr. Trump, according to people briefed on the meeting.

Campaign officials continued to discuss their legal strategy for challenging the election results on Sunday and named Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, who lost his bid for a Senate seat on Tuesday, to lead their recount effort in the state.

On his first full day as president-elect, Mr. Biden kept a low profile, emerging publicly only to attend Mass, as he does most Sundays. Afterward, he visited the cemetery where his son Beau; his first wife, Neilia; and their daughter, Naomi, are buried. In a sign of one specific stylistic change coming to the White House, he also stayed quiet in another way: Aside from circulating a video posted by his presidential transition, he had not sent a single tweet by Sunday evening.

Leaders around the world sent their congratulations to Mr. Biden, underscoring the international community’s acceptance of the results, even by those who had cultivated close personal ties with Mr. Trump, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Boris Johnson of Britain. A few refrained, including the leaders of Russia and China, Vladimir V. Putin and Xi Jinping.

There were signs that Mr. Trump would come under increasing pressure to accept the election results. The nonpartisan Center for Presidential Transition, a nonprofit that assists in transfers of power between administrations, called on his team to “immediately begin the postelection transition process.”

“While there will be legal disputes requiring adjudication, the outcome is sufficiently clear that the transition process must now begin,” members of the group’s advisory board — including Mike Leavitt, the former Republican governor of Utah, and Josh Bolten, the White House chief of staff under Mr. Bush — wrote in a letter reported earlier by Politico.

“This was a hard-fought campaign, but history is replete with examples of presidents who emerged from such campaigns to graciously assist their successors,” they wrote.

Mr. Bush extended his congratulations to Mr. Biden in a statement issued after the two men spoke on Sunday.

“Though we have political differences, I know Joe Biden to be a good man, who has won his opportunity to lead and unify our country,” Mr. Bush said in a statement.

And a former member of Mr. Trump’s cabinet, Gary Cohn, also acknowledged Mr. Biden’s victory, tweeting his “congrats” to “President-elect @joebiden and Vice President-elect @kamalaharris.”

“With over 145M votes cast,” he continued, “both campaigns should be applauded for getting an unprecedented number of citizens engaged in the democratic process.”

The silence from most other leading Republicans cut both ways for the president. While it allowed Mr. Trump to continue the fiction that he had not lost, it also left him to battle against the election results without the full, vocal support of his party behind him.

Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has declined to say anything since Friday, before the election results were known, when he released a generic statement encouraging officials to “count all the votes.” No member of his leadership team has either, apart from Mr. Blunt’s carefully worded statements on Sunday.

In a brief interview later Sunday, Mr. Blunt said a public vetting of the Trump campaign’s claims of fraud could help reassure voters on both sides of the election’s legitimacy.

“I think it is best for both the president and Biden to have as much information out as is possible,” he said.

At the same time, just two Republican senators — Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — and a handful of House members had acknowledged Mr. Biden’s win by Sunday evening, while others were trying to cast doubt on the results.

“Every legal challenge should be heard,” said Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House minority leader. “Then and only then will America decide who won the race.”

Speaking on Fox News, Mr. McCarthy questioned why news media outlets had called the presidential race for Mr. Biden, who was leading by tens of thousands of votes in key battleground states, before learning the final results of contests in competitive House districts — many of those in deep-blue California and New York — where thousands of mail-in ballots remain uncounted.

“Why would you call the presidential race first?” he asked.

News outlets call races after analyzing returns and concluding the outcome is certain, and the results in the congressional races in which ballots are still being tabulated — all but a handful of them in states that Mr. Biden easily won — have no bearing on the presidential race.

Still, some Republicans were grasping for evidence of wrongdoing. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina urged Mr. Trump to refuse to concede and fight on. He acknowledged, though, that a claim he circulated over the weekend that a postal worker was said to have overheard talk of what he believed was corruption taking place at a facility in Erie, Pa., remained unverified.

“Do not accept the media’s declaration of Biden,” Mr. Graham, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said on Fox News on Sunday morning. He called the election “contested” and urged: “Do not concede, Mr. President. Fight hard.”

Those comments reflected the advice of some of Mr. Trump’s top advisers, chiefly Rudolph W. Giuliani, his personal lawyer, who were urging him on Sunday to continue to fight the results.

A remarkably small number of Republicans called for the country to move on and acknowledged Mr. Biden’s victory. Among them were three governors of blue states — Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, Larry Hogan of Maryland and Phil Scott of Vermont — and fewer than a dozen House Republicans.

They included the centrist Representatives Tom Reed of New York and Fred Upton of Michigan; Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, who has been an outspoken critic of Mr. Trump; and four lawmakers who will not be returning to Congress next year: Representatives Paul Mitchell of Michigan, Will Hurd of Texas and Francis Rooney of Florida, who are retiring, and Representative Denver Riggleman of Virginia, who lost his primary this year.

Representative Don Young of Alaska, whose race remains undecided after a re-election bid that was more difficult than expected, said he wished “the president-elect well in what will no doubt be the most challenging chapter of his political career.”

“It is time to put the election behind us, and come together to work for a better tomorrow for our nation,” Mr. Young said in a statement.

On “Fox News Sunday,” Mr. Romney provided a contrast to many of his Republican colleagues. He said that he believed it was “appropriate” for Mr. Trump to pursue recounts and legal challenges in certain battleground states, but cautioned against widespread condemnations of the American system of elections.

“It’s important for the cause of democracy and freedom that we don’t allege fraud and theft and so forth, unless there’s very clear evidence of that,” Mr. Romney said. “To date, that evidence has not been produced.”

Mr. Romney noted that he had had a legal team ready to challenge the results of the 2012 election when he was the Republican nominee, but decided not to go forward once he saw such efforts would be futile.

“At some point, truth, freedom and democracy have to ascend,” he said, “and you step aside.”

Can Joe and Mitch Get It Done?,"WASHINGTON — In late July 2011, with an economy-shaking Treasury default only a few days away and Congress flailing, Senator Mitch McConnell received a Saturday phone call from Joseph R. Biden Jr., then the vice president.

“I think it’s time we talk,” Mr. Biden told Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, who was then the minority leader.

That opening, recounted by Mr. McConnell in his memoir, “The Long Game,” initiated the second in a series of one-on-one tax and budget negotiations that produced agreements that rescued the government from imminent fiscal disaster while drawing mixed reviews from fellow Democrats.

President-elect Biden could be making a lot more of those phone calls in the years ahead.

Unless Democrats pick off two Senate seats in Georgia to be decided in runoff elections on Jan. 5, Mr. Biden will have to navigate a Senate narrowly controlled by Mr. McConnell, who has happily turned the chamber into a graveyard for Democratic legislation. The likelihood of a Senate under Republican rule severely constrains Mr. Biden’s legislative and personnel agenda from the start, dashing the hopes of those anticipating a post-Trump opening for bold initiatives on health care, taxes and the environment and an administration populated by progressive icons.

Yet as much as anyone across the aisle, Mr. Biden — as garrulous as Mr. McConnell is aloof — has a close relationship with the Senate leader and a track record of working with him to strike bipartisan deals. The Kentuckian has described Mr. Biden not only as someone he liked, but also as a man of his word who understands how congressional negotiations work and who knows how to give as well as take.

“He doesn’t waste time telling me why I am wrong,” Mr. McConnell said in a bipartisan parting tribute in 2016 as Mr. Biden presided over the Senate. “He gets down to brass tacks, and he keeps in sight the stakes. There’s a reason ‘Get Joe on the phone’ is shorthand for ‘time to get serious’ in my office.”

Their ties have gone beyond business — Mr. McConnell attended the funeral of Mr. Biden’s son Beau Biden in 2015; Mr. Biden spoke at Mr. McConnell’s government affairs center in Louisville.

“My memory is that they actually get along reasonably well,” said Rohit Kumar, who as deputy chief of staff to Mr. McConnell sat in on the three Biden-McConnell negotiations from 2010 to 2013. “They have a lot of respect for one another. It helps that they speak the same language. They are senators.”

But much has changed in the Senate in the four years since Mr. Biden left public office, and even more in the decade since he left the chamber, where relations between the two parties are now bitter and hostile and Mr. McConnell has abandoned legislation in single-minded pursuit of the confirmation of conservative judges. When Mr. Biden suggested during the campaign that he could work with his old friend Mitch, many Democratic senators scoffed and said Mr. McConnell would eat Mr. Biden’s lunch. And by Sunday afternoon, 24 hours after Mr. Biden had been declared the victor, Mr. McConnell still had yet to issue a statement congratulating the president-elect.

Mr. Biden’s allies say he is far from naïve about the state of the Senate and Mr. McConnell’s track record. He was, after all, part of the Obama team whose initiatives were opposed in almost blanket fashion by a man who declared his chief objective was to make Barack Obama a one-term president. Mr. McConnell’s deep-seated resistance peaked with the refusal to even consider Mr. Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland to the Supreme Court in 2016. But colleagues say that Mr. Biden is not the sort to surrender before the battle begins.

“Joe Biden is well aware that Mitch McConnell was an obstructionist who blocked most of the priorities of the Biden-Obama administration and who used his position to block a whole range of judicial nominees,” said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, who occupies the seat previously held by Mr. Biden and is close to the incoming president. “But he also knows there are certain moments when you have to try.”

Democrats are not giving up on taking the majority and see the two Georgia seats as winnable in a culturally and demographically transforming state. But they say if they are stuck with Mr. McConnell as majority leader, the question of how he and Mr. Biden mesh is in many respects up to Mr. McConnell and what he determines is politically advantageous for him and his troops.

“Is this going to be the Mitch McConnell of one-term Obama threats or is it going to be a different Mitch McConnell?” asked Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat. “I really don’t know.”

For now, Mr. McConnell is not talking, declining interviews during a delicate period when President Trump has resisted the election results and control of the Senate remains unclear. Members of both parties and Mr. McConnell’s allies say he will be influenced by the contours of the 2022 election map and whether he wants to cement a legacy beyond the determined judicial push that placed more than 200 judges on the federal courts, including three Supreme Court justices. Mr. McConnell has recently declined to directly negotiate with Democrats at all, delegating pandemic talks to the Trump administration.

Another factor, senators say, will be how much control Mr. Trump tries to exert over Republican politics, whether he resorts to trolling Republicans to deter them from trying to reach agreements with the new administration. But with Mr. Trump gone from the White House, Mr. McConnell instantly becomes the most influential Republican in the capital, and he will want to use that influence.

With a razor-thin majority at best in a chamber that functions on consensus, Mr. McConnell is not all-powerful, and the slippage of just a few Republicans could complicate his life. If thwarted by Mr. McConnell, Mr. Biden is likely to try to put pressure on him by reaching out to more potentially amenable Republicans, beginning with Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah and others in the party who have been frustrated by the lack of legislative activity in the chamber.

“Joe has a lot of good relationships,” said Ms. Collins, newly empowered by a victory many on both sides of the aisle saw as unlikely. “I think there is a real hunger for the Senate to begin debating legislation and start getting things done, and vote, and have philosophical decisions made on the floor.”

With the Senate focused on judges for much of the past four years, a backlog of bipartisan bills already exists on health care, among other issues. Though the scope of legislation would be much reduced under Republican control, senators said they could envision deals on public works projects, prescription drug costs and some elements of immigration law, including extending protections for the so-called Dreamers as well as the handling of visas for highly skilled workers.

All anticipate that the continuing response to the pandemic — both from a health and economic perspective — will dominate the legislative agenda for the foreseeable future.

The test of how a Republican Senate and a Biden administration interact will come quickly with Mr. Biden’s need to fill a cabinet. Holding the majority, Mr. McConnell will essentially wield veto power over the choices since he can decide which to bring to the floor. In decades past, senators granted a new president wide discretion in his picks, but the confirmation process in the Senate has become a partisan battleground, and some Democrats refused to vote for any of Mr. Trump’s choices. Some Republicans might want to return the favor, though they also realize national security positions and other top posts must be occupied.

“The vice president deserves a cabinet,” Senator Lindsey Graham, the newly re-elected Republican of South Carolina, said on Friday, though he added that he would not support nominees he considers unqualified or extreme. “I will give him my input about who I could vote for secretary of state, attorney general.”

One area where the Biden administration should anticipate tough going is the courts. Mr. McConnell just spent four years filling court vacancies with carefully vetted conservatives. He is unlikely to be in a hurry to dilute their ranks by rushing Democratic picks on to the bench to counter them.

While Democrats are hoping Mr. Biden brings his deal-making prowess to the job, that was not always the case when it came to his talks with Mr. McConnell.

Though they ultimately supported it, Democrats were furious over Mr. Biden’s uninvited intervention in a showdown in late 2012 over the “fiscal cliff” looming from the impending expiration of President George W. Bush’s tax cuts.

Many believed Mr. McConnell outfoxed him when Mr. Biden agreed to extend the tax cuts except for income above $450,000 — an outcome Mr. Biden portrayed as persuading Mr. McConnell to raise taxes by $600 billion, but which progressives believed was far too generous to wealthy taxpayers. Democrats complained that they received little in return, and that the agreement hamstrung them for years in trying to generate new sources of revenue.

“That was a great deal for Mitch McConnell and a terrible deal for America,” Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, shot back at Mr. Biden during a presidential primary debate last June when Mr. Biden gloated about the agreement.

Yet Mr. Kumar, the former McConnell aide, said he believed the Republican advantage on that bargain had been exaggerated over the years — a view that Democrats must hope is true if they are now counting on Mr. Biden to find common ground with Mr. McConnell.

“The truth of the matter is we thought we got a good deal,” said Mr. Kumar, now a senior official at the national office of PwC in Washington. “But we didn’t think we had run the table.”"
Five Takeaways From President-Elect Biden’s Victory Speech,"Joseph R. Biden Jr. waited a long time to give the speech he delivered in Delaware on Saturday night. Not just the five days since Election Day, but arguably the 48 years since he was first elected to the Senate, during which he ran for president three times. And at age 77, as Mr. Biden came trotting up the runway to an explosion of car horns and cheers, beaming and looking almost surprised by the ovation, it was clear that his moment had arrived.

Here are five takeaways from the president-elect’s victory speech.

The contrast between Mr. Biden and President Trump was bracing and notable in almost every passage, as the president-elect invoked his own spirituality and shared credit for the moment with his supporters and the people around him.

He quoted from a hymn, “On Eagle’s Wings.” He thanked his supporters: “I owe you, I owe you, I owe you everything.” He warmly praised Kamala Harris, his running mate, and celebrated the fact that she would be the first woman, let alone woman of color, to serve as vice president: “It’s long overdue, and we’re reminded tonight of all those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen.”

Most of all, even as the nation faces one of the darkest periods in its history — a deadly pandemic, economic decline, political polarization — Mr. Biden was relentlessly optimistic, even cheerful. “We can do it,” he said. “I know we can.”

There were many notable passages in the speech, but one stood out. “Let this grim era of demonization in America begin to end here and now,” he said. That is probably a line that people will talk about long into the Biden presidency.

Mr. Biden mentioned Mr. Trump’s name only once during his 17-minute speech. He ignored the fact that the president had not conceded, and that he had challenged — without any evidence — the legitimacy of the election. Mr. Biden also did not note that many top Republican leaders, presumably following Mr. Trump’s lead, had not offered him the customary congratulations.

But if Mr. Biden did not dwell on the president, he certainly spoke to his supporters, a notable contrast to Mr. Trump’s speech after his own victory in 2016. “To those who voted for President Trump, I understand your disappointment tonight,” he said. “I’ve lost a couple of elections myself. But now, let’s give each other a chance.”

And while he ignored Mr. Trump’s protests about the election, Mr. Biden made clear that there should be no doubt about the legitimacy of the outcome. “The people of this nation have spoken,” he said. “They have delivered us a clear victory. A convincing victory. A victory for ‘We the People.’ We have won with the most votes ever cast for a presidential ticket in the history of this nation — 74 million.”

Mr. Biden’s strategy here was clear. He has exceeded the 270 Electoral College votes needed to become president, and may end up gathering more than 300. He is now moving past the contest with Mr. Trump and into the role of president-elect. The transition is at hand, and the trappings of the presidency have begun to surround him — apparent in the size of the Secret Service contingent that followed him to give his speech, and the way every television station spoke of him as the president-elect. 

He is seeking to relegate Mr. Trump to the sidelines, and turning to the urgent business of forming a new government and dealing with the crises he will face.

Mr. Biden left no doubt that the coronavirus pandemic would be a priority for his administration in a way that it has not been under Mr. Trump.

Mr. Biden announced that on Monday, he would appoint top science and health experts to a committee to craft a plan for battling the pandemic, which he said would be ready to put in place when he and Ms. Harris take office in January. Mr. Biden told the nation that getting the coronavirus under control was crucial to normalcy and economic prosperity.

“We cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality or relish life’s most precious moments — hugging a grandchild, birthdays, weddings, graduations, all the moments that matter most to us — until we get this virus under control,” he said.

Mr. Trump has taken a much different approach. Throughout his campaign, he urged Americans not to fear the virus, asserting that the danger was being exaggerated by his political opponents. He defied the advice of health officials on precautions like wearing a mask, even after he himself was diagnosed with the virus.

Mr. Biden’s victory comes as the nation is setting daily records for new infections and the health authorities have warned of a bleak winter. Masks were everywhere at his celebration. 

Mr. Trump defined the tone of his presidency at his inauguration, with a dark speech in which he notably did not reach out beyond his base of supporters. The strategy had lifted him to a narrow victory in 2016 — in the Electoral College; he lost the popular vote — and he sought to reprise it in his losing campaign this year.

Mr. Biden aggressively moved in the other direction. 

“I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide, but to unify — who doesn’t see red and blue states, but a United States,” he said on Saturday. “And who will work with all my heart to win the confidence of the whole people.” 

To some extent, that reflects what Mr. Biden said during the campaign, but the approach will take on a new urgency as he becomes president. Pending the outcome of two runoffs in Georgia, the Senate is controlled by Republicans, and he will need to reach out to senators from the red states if he wants to enact an agenda. 

There have been some impressive pyrotechnics during this campaign — the ones over the Washington skyline on the night Mr. Trump accepted the Republican nomination from the back lawn of the White House come to mind. 

This one, though, set a bar that may be hard to match: Fireworks and drones spelled out Mr. Biden’s name, Ms. Harris’s name and a map of the United States. Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris, surrounded by their families, stood onstage staring into the Delaware sky, lit up again and again on the night that Mr. Biden has been awaiting for most of his life."
"Dancing in the Streets, and a Parking Lot, for Joe Biden","People have not historically hustled to spontaneous outdoor dance parties for Joe Biden.

They have not clanged spoons against frying pans in celebration for him, formed triumphant honk-parades along Fifth Avenue for him, made Champagne toasts with strangers in his honor through chants and tears.

“BIDEN!” his supporters shouted outside Manhattan’s Washington Square Park on Saturday, the call echoing from apartment windows and taxis and sidewalk restaurant tables. “JOE BIDEN!”

Joe Biden. That Joe Biden — institutionalist 70-something, incorrigible square, inexhaustible reciter of Irish poetry.

But then, it seems that defeating President Trump can do strange things for a man’s reputation.

In Mr. Biden’s first hours as president-elect on Saturday, many voters who have appraised him through the decades as a particular kind of capital veteran — prone to perpetual windiness, requests for a “point of personal privilege” in casual conversation and digressions about dead senators — appeared ready to greet him as a sort of conquering hero.

“Winners write history,” said Amanda Litman, a former aide to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign and the executive director of Run for Something, a group encouraging Democrats to seek local office. “I think he definitely gets bonus points for doing what no one thought was possible, even when we hoped it was.”

Ms. Litman said she had spent the day walking miles across Brooklyn, sobbing in the street and encountering an intersection dance-a-thon, set to “Shout” by the Isley Brothers, that felt airlifted from a wedding reception.

Mr. Biden, of course, has not generally been Washington’s leading purveyor of cool. That will not necessarily change over the long term. It is likely that gushing Democratic affection would have awaited anyone who managed to beat Mr. Trump.

And yet, this is the person who did it.

If the last two commanders-in-chief have been phenomenon candidates who became phenomenon presidents, Mr. Biden would appear to be ending the trend, comfortable instead with the identity that helped elect him: the man to rein things in a bit, to lower the collective volume before the neighbors complain.

This is someone who does not drink, who does not smoke, who once scolded friends at his own bachelor party for growing too rowdy.

During the campaign, Mr. Biden’s team strained to create a mini-cult of personality around him, bragging on his signature accessory (aviators), his signature vice (ice cream), his interest in muscle cars.

“Ridin’ With Biden,” went one slogan that kinda-sorta caught on.

While most of the impromptu gatherings this weekend came in places unaccustomed to Biden-associated revelry — with rollicking bashes from Los Angeles to Washington to most any city in between, cheering Mr. Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris — there was at least one ZIP code for which the embrace was more culmination than novelty.

On Saturday, hundreds of cars jammed into a parking lot outside an events center in Wilmington, Del., ferrying in Mr. Biden’s friends and fans from the state he represented for 36 years in the Senate for a somewhat socially distanced drive-in rally. They sat on the roofs of their vehicles and played cornhole as they waited. They lugged around oversize American flags and kibitzed in lawn chairs and balanced Champagne flutes on top of their cars. They were proud, they said, of their state’s most famous resident.

Carrie Casey, 49, said she had come in part to bask in “the utter excitement of a Delaware almost-native winning the presidency, as well as the first female and woman of color vice president.”

She had turned out a few days earlier — the original Election Day, on Tuesday — for what was supposed to have been a victory party. Instead, with the outcome uncertain, Mr. Biden gave only brief remarks about trusting the process. Some of his supporters left deflated and on edge.

Mr. Biden’s team had a few more false starts this past week as the counting of votes continued. Early Friday, his campaign was advising that he would give a major prime-time speech by evening, as a crowd began to congregate outside a security barrier. He had planned to make use of the elaborate, flag-studded setup that has remained on display all week.

As the sun set in Wilmington on Friday, teleprompters were ready, “Biden Harris” flashed on big screens, and onlookers convened in an increasingly chilly parking lot nearby, hoping to catch a glimpse of a president-elect. But with Pennsylvania, and the race, still officially uncalled, they would have to wait another day.

“I was here Tuesday night, and it was, like, very stressful,” Ms. Casey said. “To wake up in the morning and there still be hope, and the next day and the next day, and being patient — and to be here right now is absolutely incredible.”

In his own speech, Mr. Biden was quintessentially himself. After jogging onstage to a chorus of car honks, he began with a nod to the fine people of Delaware (“the people who brought me to the dance!”) and then decided to name a few, shouting out assorted local dignitaries like a city council candidate.

He quoted relatives and welcomed Ms. Harris and her husband to the Biden family, “like it or not.”

He tried to empathize with Trump voters, noting that he had “lost a couple times myself” in his political day. He acknowledged the present national gravity. He projected humility. He smiled a little.

It had been a long campaign — three, actually, for the presidency alone in his lifetime. He looked out on guests who had seen him lose as often as they’d seen him win.

This time around, the mood was purely festive — so much so that Maureen Whilby had decided to celebrate her 55th birthday on-site, where the fireworks and confetti blasts might as well have been for her, too. 

“Best birthday in the world!” she said, several hours before the sky would light up with the words “Biden” and “president elect.” “Never forget this birthday. Unity. Bring us back together. No division.”

Nearby, a cluster of Delawareans stood together wearing T-shirts indicating their past lives as Iowa volunteers for Mr. Biden, a reminder of the dark, icy days he spent in a state that rejected him in his 2008 run and again in 2020.

“We were a little nervous at that point,” admitted Patti McKelvey, 53, a Pilates and yoga teacher from Wilmington. “But we were still 100 percent backing Joe.”

State Representative Krista Griffith — “I’m Joe Biden’s state representative,” she noted — also made the trek to Iowa. This, she suggested, was more fun.

“We all know him,” she said on Saturday. “We just can’t wait for the rest of the country to experience that.”

"What’s a Runoff, and Why Are There Two? Here’s Why Georgia Matters","As the dust settles from the presidential race, the eyes of the political world have already shifted to Georgia, where two runoff elections set for early January will almost certainly determine which party has control of the Senate.

The outcome of the contests, which will play out two weeks before President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s inauguration, will either swing the majority to Democrats, handing the new president broad power to carry out his policy agenda and push through nominations as he sees fit, or leave Republicans in charge, allowing them to influence his plans.

In the weeks ahead, tens of millions of dollars in campaign cash are expected to pour into the state to fund a marathon of political advertising, while party leaders and interest groups on both sides train their attention on the races.

Here’s how it will work.

A runoff election is essentially a rematch that is held when none of the candidates meet the criteria for winning. Under Georgia law, candidates must receive a majority of the vote to win an election. If no candidate breaks 50 percent, the top two vote-getters then face off again in a runoff election to determine the winner.

Georgia’s runoff law was created in the 1960s as a way to preserve white political power in a majority-white state and diminish the influence of Black politicians who could more easily win in a multicandidate race with a plurality of the vote, according to an Interior Department report.

Since the 1990s, Democrats have won only one of seven statewide runoffs in general or special elections, according to Inside Elections, the nonpartisan political newsletter.

While Senate elections are staggered so that a state’s two seats are not up for re-election at the same time, this was an unusual year for Georgia.

Senator David Perdue, a Republican, was facing a normal re-election race for the seat he won in 2014. In addition, Senator Kelly Loeffler, another Republican appointed last year to succeed Senator Johnny Isakson after he retired because of health issues, was facing a special election to serve out the remainder of his term until 2022.

Both of their races went to runoffs because neither they nor their challengers garnered at least 50 percent of the vote.

After a prolonged count that ended on Friday night, Mr. Perdue fell just short of the majority he would have needed to win re-election against Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, sending both of them to a runoff. In 2017, Mr. Ossoff lost in a runoff election for seat in the House.

It has been clear since Tuesday that Ms. Loeffler’s race would be decided in a runoff, after the Rev. Dr. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, and Ms. Loeffler emerged as the top two finishers in a crowded field competing to replace Mr. Isakson.

Georgia’s law says the runoffs are to take place on the Tuesday of the ninth week after the election. That puts them on Jan. 5. Voters must be registered to participate by Dec. 7.

The state will hold three weeks of early voting. Registered voters may vote by mail if they request an absentee ballot.

It is traditionally more difficult for candidates to convince voters to turn out for elections that do not feature the presidential contest on the ballot, and this special election will come shortly after New Year’s with the country still in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic.

In the past, Democrats have struggled in such races, with Republicans dominating the format in conservative-learning Georgia.

But both parties are expected to dump ample resources into turning out their voters for the runoffs, and since there are no other races happening around the country, enormous national attention will be focused on Georgia.

The stakes will be high. Republicans hold a 53-to-47 majority, but after elections this week, they were tied 48 to 48 with Democrats. While Senate races in Alaska and North Carolina have yet to be called, Republicans are expected to prevail in those states, which would put the party in control of 50 seats.

If Republican leads in those states hold, Democrats would need to capture both of the seats in Georgia to secure a 50-50 tie in the Senate. Then, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris could cast tiebreaking votes to carry out the Democratic agenda. If they were to lose one, Republicans would maintain their majority, albeit by the slimmest of margins.

With judicial nominees, a stimulus deal, infrastructure and health care measures, and tax and spending policies all on the line, the Senate races in Georgia are likely to take on an intensity that mirrors the presidential race that just ended.

And with President Trump refusing to concede and making baseless accusations that the election was stolen from him, Republicans are likely to try to use their grievances about the presidential race to galvanize their voters to turn out in Georgia and deny Mr. Biden the Senate he would need to get things done."
Biden Could Roll Back Trump Agenda With Blitz of Executive Actions,"

WASHINGTON — President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. is poised to unleash a series of executive actions on his first day in the Oval Office, prompting what is likely to be a yearslong effort to unwind President Trump’s domestic agenda and immediately signal a wholesale shift in the United States’ place in the world.

In the first hours after he takes the oath of office on the West Front of the Capitol at noon on Jan. 20, Mr. Biden has said, he will send a letter to the United Nations indicating that the country will rejoin the global effort to combat climate change, reversing Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord with more than 174 countries.

Mr. Biden’s afternoon will be a busy one.

He has vowed that on Day 1 he will move rapidly to confront the coronavirus pandemic by appointing a “national supply chain commander” and establishing a “pandemic testing board,” similar to Franklin D. Roosevelt’s wartime production panel. He has said he will restore the rights of government workers to unionize. He has promised to order a new fight against homelessness and resettle more refugees fleeing war. He has pledged to abandon Mr. Trump’s travel ban on mostly Muslim countries and to begin calling foreign leaders in an attempt to restore trust among the United States’ closest allies.

“Every president wants to come out of the gate strong and start fulfilling campaign promises before lunch on the first day,” said Dan Pfeiffer, who served as a senior adviser to President Barack Obama and helped choreograph Mr. Obama’s first days in the White House. “Executive orders are the best way to do that.”

For Mr. Biden, who won the election in a deeply divided nation, the early signals he sends as the country’s new leader will be critical. On the trail, he repeatedly said he was campaigning as a Democrat but would govern “as an American.” Following through on that promise will require him to demonstrate some respect for parts of the Trump agenda that were fiercely supported by the more than 70 million people who did not cast ballots for him.

“How far is he going to go?” Rick Santorum, a former Republican senator, asked on CNN on Saturday, hours after Mr. Biden had been declared the victor. “If you want to show that you want to work on a bipartisan basis, then you don’t go out right away and sign all the executive orders on immigration and bypass the Congress.”

But there is no question that Mr. Biden and members of his party are eager to systematically erase what they view as destructive policies that the president pursued on the environment, immigration, health care, gay rights, trade, tax cuts, civil rights, abortion, race relations, military spending and more.

Some of that will require cooperation with Congress, which may remain divided next year. If Republicans maintain control of the Senate, Mr. Biden’s pledges to roll back some of Mr. Trump’s tax cuts are almost certain to run headfirst into fierce opposition from that chamber. Efforts to advance a more liberal agenda on civil rights and race relations — centerpieces of Mr. Biden’s stump speech during his campaign — may falter. And his efforts to shape the new government with appointments could be constrained by the need to win approval in a Republican Senate.

But Mr. Biden may be able to achieve some of his goals with nothing more than the stroke of a pen. Mr. Trump largely failed to successfully negotiate with House Democrats during his four years in office, leaving him no choice but to use executive actions to advance his agenda. Mr. Biden can use the same tools to reverse them.

Prior presidents have tried to do just that, though not always successfully.

On his first full day in the White House in 2009, Mr. Obama issued an executive order on presidential records and a second one on ethics that, among other provisions, tried to ban members of his administration from lobbying the federal government for two years after they leave. Ethics watchdogs later complained that some officials had found ways around the restrictions.

The next day, Mr. Obama ordered an end to torture by the government, responding to an outcry over the use of harsh interrogation measures by his predecessor. He also ordered the closure of the terrorist detention facility at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba — which members of Congress were continuing to block by the time he left office eight years later.

Mr. Trump, too, moved quickly. In the first hours after he was sworn in, Mr. Trump issued an executive order pledging to repeal the Affordable Care Act and directing the government to “take all actions consistent with law to minimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens of the act.”

In the week that followed, Mr. Trump issued executive orders on immigration, requesting changes to asylum proceedings at the border, increasing deportations of undocumented immigrants and banning travel from several mostly Muslim countries — an order that incited chaos at several airports as border officials struggled to understand whom it applied to.

Some executive orders have become almost automatic at the start of a new administration. Mr. Biden is almost certain to move immediately to revoke the so-called global gag rule, which prohibits federal government funding for foreign organizations that provide or even talk about abortion. The rule, also known as the Mexico City policy, has been a political Ping-Pong ball since Ronald Reagan was president and is typically in place only under Republican administrations. Mr. Trump reinstated it on his first business day in office.

But Mr. Biden has signaled that his top priority will be demonstrating a much more muscular federal approach to the pandemic than Mr. Trump’s leave-it-to-the states strategy.

Aides said he would use the power of his office to invoke the Defense Production Act — the Korean War-era law that allows the president to order businesses to manufacture products necessary for national defense — to build up supplies more aggressively than Mr. Trump has.

While Mr. Biden would like to see a national mask mandate, his advisers have concluded that he does not have the legal authority to impose one. So he will try to increase mask wearing in other ways. He has already said that, as president, he would require masks on all federal property, an executive order that could have wide reach and is likely to come in the first hours or days of his presidency.

In addition to mandating masks in federal buildings, Mr. Biden has said he would require them on “all interstate transportation.”

The president-elect has also repeatedly derided Mr. Trump’s lack of ethical standards, accusing him of waging an extensive assault on Washington’s norms and traditions. Mr. Biden’s response to that will probably take the form of an ethics pledge to impose tough new requirements on the people who serve in his government.

“The Trump administration has shredded those standards,” Mr. Biden’s campaign wrote on his website. “On Day 1, Biden will issue an ethics pledge, building and improving on the Obama-Biden administration’s pledge, to ensure that every member of his administration focuses day in and day out on the best outcomes for the American people, and nothing else.”

In addition to rejoining the climate accord, Mr. Biden has also made it clear that he will immediately begin using the levers of executive authority to re-establish Mr. Obama’s regime of environmental regulations that Mr. Trump systematically dismantled during his tenure.

That is likely to include a rapid rescission of an executive order Mr. Trump issued early in his administration that itself called for revoking all regulations addressing climate change and instead promoting fossil fuel development — and replacing it with one that declares a Biden administration’s intention to cut planet-warming greenhouse gases.

“Revocation of executive orders can be done immediately,” said Michael Burger, the executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University who has studied what climate regulation might look like in a Biden administration. “That’s a big deal because the executive orders give direction to administrative agencies about how to exercise their discretion and what the priorities are for the administration.”

Mr. Biden may also move quickly to restore national monuments that Mr. Trump shrank soon after taking office; stop the Trump administration’s expedited reviews of fossil fuel projects such as oil pipelines; and reverse a 2017 order to “encourage energy exploration and production” offshore, including the outer continental shelf.

Efforts to assist poor communities — often situated in proximity to toxic polluting sites and bearing the brunt of climate change consequences — could also be undertaken from the White House. That might include executive orders establishing an environmental justice advisory council that can coordinate policy across agencies; creating screening tools to better understand environmental disparities across the country; and increasing pollution monitoring in frontline communities.

Passing bigger parts of Mr. Biden’s environmental agenda, like eliminating fossil fuel emissions from the power sector by 2035, would almost certainly require Congress to pass a clean-energy-specific law, most likely in the form of a mandate that an increasing percentage of electricity generated in the United States will be produced by zero-emissions sources, such as wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric power and possibly nuclear power.

Thomas J. Pyle, the president of the Institute for Energy Research, an organization that supports the use of fossil fuels, said that “if history is a guide,” Republicans would be unlikely to support any type of mandate.

“Certainly he does not have a mandate for his climate plan,” Mr. Pyle said. “He will be constrained to executive orders and carefully crafted regulations.”

Top Republicans Are Silent on Biden Victory as Trump Refuses to Concede,"WASHINGTON — As President Trump refused to concede defeat on Saturday, top Republican congressional leaders followed suit, refraining from releasing the customary statements congratulating the victor that have been standard among senior lawmakers in both parties when a presidential election has been declared.

Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader and Republican of Kentucky, declined on Saturday to acknowledge Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory, with an aide instead pointing reporters to a generic “count all the votes” statement Mr. McConnell released on Friday before the results were known.

In that statement, released on Twitter as Mr. Trump preemptively contested the outcome of the election, Mr. McConnell had outlined “how this must work in our great country.” “Every legal vote should be counted,” he said. “Any illegally-submitted ballots must not. All sides must get to observe the process. And the courts are here to apply the laws & resolve disputes.”

“That’s how Americans’ votes decide the result,” he said.

His silence on Saturday came as other Republican leaders also kept mum about the results, and some openly questioned it.

“The election isn’t over until all legal votes are counted and certified,” Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the second-ranking Republican, said on Twitter. “There are still serious legal challenges that have been made, and until that process is resolved, the election is not final. The American people deserve a fair and transparent process.”

The reactions suggested that Republicans on Capitol Hill, who have spent four years clinging tightly to Mr. Trump or at least have avoided publicly countering him for fear of provoking an angry tweet, were sticking to those approaches even after his loss.

In the weeks leading up to the election, as Mr. Trump refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, some Republicans including Mr. McConnell gently pushed back without directly rebuking the president, making it clear that if he were to lose, they expected him to abide by the results. “The winner of the November 3rd election will be inaugurated on January 20th,” Mr. McConnell said then. “There will be an orderly transition just as there has been every four years since 1792.”

But Mr. Trump’s reluctance to accept his defeat, and his angry, and false, insistence on Saturday that he had in fact won raised questions about whether any senior Republican would be willing to contradict him.

Only a handful of rank-and-file Republicans, including some who are not likely to face voters again, offered their good wishes for Mr. Biden.

“It’s time to come together,” wrote Representative Will Hurd, Republican of Texas, who is retiring. “America has spoken and we must respect the decision. More unites us than divides us; we can find common ground. I hope the president-elect can embody this. I wish him good luck and I wish the president a successful final few weeks.”

Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and a frequent critic of Mr. Trump, also offered a traditional statement of well wishes to the victor, and was one of the few members of his party to refer to Mr. Biden by his new title.

“Ann and I extend our congratulations to President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris,” he wrote on Twitter. “We know both of them as people of good will and admirable character. We pray that God may bless them in the days and years ahead.”

Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska also directly congratulated Mr. Biden as president-elect and said “it appears we will soon then to the peaceful transition of power, which is fundamental to our system of democracy and ultimately honors the American people.” She added, “Honoring their choice in who leads has always defined us and is the source of our exceptionalism.”

But several Republicans who are regarded as rising stars in the party said any congratulations were premature, portraying the election results as a creation of the news media and alluding to the possibility of legal action that could change them.

“The media do not get to determine who the president is,” said Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri. “The people do. When all lawful votes have been counted, recounts finished, and allegations of fraud addressed, we will know who the winner is.”

Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, who has announced he is retiring, issued a statement congratulating both Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden for having “run hard, spirited campaigns that have inspired record civic engagement.” But he said that given the closeness of the results, Americans needed assurances that the election was “being conducted with integrity,”

“Today’s announcement by the media of the election’s outcome is a projection,” Mr. Toomey said. “A final outcome will be reached when the election process concludes, which is after all legal votes have been counted, litigation is resolved, and any recounts are completed.”

Representative Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana and a contender for a leadership position in his party, said on Twitter he called Mr. Trump and encouraged him to “Stay strong and keep fighting, sir!”

“The nation is depending upon your resolve,” Mr. Johnson said he told the president. “We must exhaust every available legal remedy to restore Americans’ trust in the fairness of our election system.”

Read Kamala Harris’s Vice President-Elect Acceptance Speech,"Kamala Harris, the first woman, the first Black woman, and the first woman of Indian heritage to be elected vice president, said Saturday that “a new day for America” had arrived and thanked Americans for making their voices heard in a brief speech on Saturday night, hours after she and Joseph R. Biden Jr. had been declared the winners of the 2020 presidential election.

In her historic remarks, Ms. Harris recalled her mother, an immigrant who came to California as a teenager.

“She maybe didn’t quite imagine this moment,” Ms. Harris said of her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris. “But she believed so deeply in an America where a moment like this is possible, and so I am thinking about her and about the generations of women, Black women, Asian, white, Latina, Native American women — who throughout our nation’s history have paved the way for this moment tonight — women who fought and sacrificed so much for equality and liberty and justice for all.”

Ms. Harris acknowledged “all the women who have worked to secure and protect the right to vote for over a century.”

“Tonight,” she said, “I reflect on their struggle, their determination, and the strength of their vision to see what can be unburdened by what has been. And I stand on their shoulders.”

Here is a transcript of Ms. Harris’s remarks as they were prepared for delivery.

Good evening.

Congressman John Lewis, before his passing, wrote: “Democracy is not a state. It is an act.”

And what he meant was that America’s democracy is not guaranteed.

It is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it, to guard it and never take it for granted.

And protecting our democracy takes struggle.

It takes sacrifice. There is joy in it and there is progress.

Because “We The People” have the power to build a better future.

And when our very democracy was on the ballot in this election, with the very soul of America at stake, and the world watching, you ushered in a new day for America.

To our campaign staff and volunteers, this extraordinary team — thank you for bringing more people than ever before into the democratic process and for making this victory possible.

To the poll workers and election officials across our country who have worked tirelessly to make sure every vote is counted — our nation owes you a debt of gratitude as you have protected the integrity of our democracy.

And to the American people who make up our beautiful country — thank you for turning out in record numbers to make your voices heard.

I know times have been challenging, especially the last several months.

The grief, sorrow, and pain. The worries and the struggles.

But we’ve also witnessed your courage, your resilience, and the generosity of your spirit.

For four years, you marched and organized for equality and justice, for our lives, and for our planet.

And then, you voted. You delivered a clear message.

You chose hope, unity, decency, science, and, yes, truth.

You chose Joe Biden as the next President of the United States of America.

Joe is a healer. A uniter. A tested and steady hand.

A person whose own experience of loss gives him a sense of purpose that will help us, as a nation, reclaim our own sense of purpose.

And a man with a big heart who loves with abandon.

It’s his love for Jill, who will be an incredible first lady.

It’s his love for Hunter, Ashley, his grandchildren, and the entire Biden family.

And while I first knew Joe as Vice President, I really got to know him as the father who loved Beau, my dear friend, who we remember here today.

To my husband Doug, our children Cole and Ella, my sister Maya, and our whole family — I love you all more than I can express.

We are so grateful to Joe and Jill for welcoming our family into theirs on this incredible journey.

And to the woman most responsible for my presence here today — my mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, who is always in our hearts.

When she came here from India at the age of 19, maybe she didn’t quite imagine this moment.

But she believed so deeply in an America where a moment like this is possible.

So, I’m thinking about her and about the generations of women — Black Women.

Asian, White, Latina, and Native American women throughout our nation’s history who have paved the way for this moment tonight.

Women who fought and sacrificed so much for equality, liberty, and justice for all, including the Black women, who are too often overlooked, but so often prove that they are the backbone of our democracy.

All the women who worked to secure and protect the right to vote for over a century: 100 years ago with the 19th Amendment, 55 years ago with the Voting Rights Act, and now, in 2020, with a new generation of women in our country who cast their ballots and continued the fight for their fundamental right to vote and be heard.

Tonight, I reflect on their struggle, their determination and the strength of their vision — to see what can be unburdened by what has been — I stand on their shoulders.

And what a testament it is to Joe’s character that he had the audacity to break one of the most substantial barriers that exists in our country and select a woman as his vice president.

But while I may be the first woman in this office, I won’t be the last.

Because every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities.

And to the children of our country, regardless of your gender, our country has sent you a clear message:Dream with ambition, lead with conviction, and see yourself in a way that others might not see you, simply because they’ve never seen it before.

And we will applaud you every step of the way.

To the American people:

No matter who you voted for, I will strive to be the vice president that Joe was to President Obama — loyal, honest, and prepared, waking up every day thinking of you and your families. Because now is when the real work begins.

The hard work. The necessary work. The good work. The essential work to save lives and beat this pandemic. To rebuild our economy so it works for working people.

To root out systemic racism in our justice system and society.

To combat the climate crisis.

To unite our country and heal the soul of our nation.

The road ahead will not be easy.

But America is ready. And so are Joe and I.

We have elected a president who represents the best in us.

A leader the world will respect and our children can look up to.

A commander in chief who will respect our troops and keep our country safe.

And a president for all Americans.

It is now my great honor to introduce the president-elect of the United States of America, Joe Biden."
How Georgia Turned From Reliably Republican to Political Ground Zero,"MARIETTA, Ga. — It took a lifetime for Angie Jones to become a Democrat.

As a young woman, she was the proud daughter of a conservative family active in Republican politics. Ten years ago, after a friend’s son came out as gay, Ms. Jones became an independent, though one who watched Fox News. After the 2016 election, Ms. Jones, a stay-at-home mother in Johns Creek, a pristine wealthy suburb north of Atlanta, became frustrated with her conservative friends defending President Trump through scandal after scandal.

And this year, she voted for Joseph R. Biden Jr., after spending months phone banking, canvassing and organizing for Democratic candidates with a group of suburban women across Atlanta.

“I feel like the Republican Party left me,” said Ms. Jones, 54. “It very much created an existential crisis for me.”

This week, the political evolution of voters like Ms. Jones drove Georgia to a breakthrough for Democrats: Mr. Biden, the president-elect, is on the verge of adding the state to his winning electoral margin, with a narrow lead that is nevertheless a dramatic sign of the shifting politics of the South.

And two Democratic candidates, the Rev. Dr. Raphael G. Warnock and Jon Ossoff, forced runoff elections on Jan. 5 that should decide control of the Senate, and the fate of much of Mr. Biden’s agenda. With the November election barely over, the nation’s political focus will now turn to Georgia as much as the presidential transition in Washington, as both parties pour money and resources into what may be an epic political battle, in a state that was considered safely Republican just a decade ago.

“It’s going to be hand to hand, street by street, and either one of them can win,” said former Gov. Roy Barnes, the most recent Democratic governor in the state.

The runoff contests will take place in a Georgia that bears little political resemblance to the state that voted out Mr. Barnes in 2002 after he engaged in a contentious effort to remove the Confederate battle emblem from the state flag.

The population surged to 10.6 million in 2019 from 7.9 million in 2000, and the foreign-born population now exceeds 10 percent of the state’s total. Atlanta has gone from corporate bland to youthful dynamic, with its indoor food markets, destination dining scene and rich entertainment culture, including a hip-hop scene that drives trends worldwide. In 2004, 70 percent of voters were white, according to exit polls. This year, white voters made up 60 percent.

Until the 1970s, Georgia was virtually a one-party state, with conservative Democrats dominant. But as conservative voters moved en masse to the Republican Party, Democrats were left concentrated in places like the city of Atlanta, adjacent and urbane Decatur, and smaller cities with significant African-American populations.

In the last few years, however, distaste for Trumpism has spread and demographic change has exploded, giving Democrats new strength in the vote-rich northern suburbs of Atlanta — like Cobb and Gwinnett Counties, which were once bastions of Republican power.

Hillary Clinton carried Cobb and Gwinnett even as she lost the state in 2016. This year, Mr. Biden won them again. And he added to her margin in the state, especially in the counties that are home to Georgia’s most important second-tier cities — Augusta, Columbus, Macon, Savannah and Athens.

In recent months, the pandemic has slowed the Georgia economy, with unemployment rising to 6.4 percent in September from 5.7 percent in August. Covid-19 cases are increasing too; over the past week, each day has averaged 2,242 new cases, an increase of 42 percent from the average two weeks earlier.

A new generation of Democratic candidates has left behind the fiscal and social conservatism of its forefathers to embrace a rising demographic coalition of Black voters, college-educated suburban women and a more politically engaged younger generation.

Even if Mr. Biden’s victory was ultimately delivered by Northern industrial states like Pennsylvania, his slim margin in Georgia points to the future of the Democratic Party, which could come into clearer view in the Senate runoffs.

Republicans will try to stop Democratic momentum, hoping that Mr. Biden’s strong performance here was more about Mr. Trump’s divisiveness than the G.O.P.’s loosening grip on the dynamic South. For Democrats, winning both seats would leave the Senate at a 50-50 split, with the vice president, Kamala Harris, the tiebreaker.

Even one Senate seat could prove that the demographic changes that Democrats have long predicted would favor them in swaths of the Sun Belt have finally arrived.

And the lessons learned through the organizing of Black and young voters and the energizing of the suburbs are being watched by Democrats in other Sun Belt battlegrounds like Texas, and in Deep South states like South Carolina and Mississippi, where truly competing with Republicans remains a distant dream.

When Ms. Harris campaigned last weekend in Gwinnett County, supporters waved signs in Chinese and Spanish.

As a lively crowd waited for Ms. Harris in the vast parking lot of a multipurpose arena, Munir Meghjani, 32, a commercial real estate agent, said Ms. Harris’s multicultural roots resonated in the changing county.

“I see more and more people like me. I see more and more people of color. I see diversity increasing every single day, not only in Gwinnett County, not only in Atlanta, but across Georgia,” he said. “We’ve always been here, but we’ve always just stayed at home.”

Xiang Li, 36, who works for an insurance company and lives in the county, voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 but said he couldn’t this year. 

“I’m voting Democrat in the runoff because of what McConnell has done to the Senate,” Mr. Li, a registered independent, said in reference to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. “Next election after that, I’ll see what’s going on. I’m hoping the Republican Party comes back to normalcy.”

Despite the changes, the Republican Party here remains well organized, powerful and popular, especially in rural and exurban communities. Democrats had hoped to gain control of the State House to pressure the Republican governor, Brian Kemp, to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, enact changes to the voting system and give them some voice in the redrawing of congressional and state legislative maps after the 2020 census.

But they are likely to pick up only a couple of seats. The Republicans even picked off the House’s minority leader, Bob Trammell, an embarrassing Democratic loss. And redistricting could cost Democrats some of the gains they have made.

With a President-elect Biden, “Democrats will be fat and happy, and Republicans will be scared and mobilized, and maybe even angry,” said Brian Robinson, a Republican political strategist in Georgia. “And they’re going to want to build a red wall in the Senate.”

The intense political spotlight on Georgia is not entirely unexpected. In 2012, President Barack Obama’s strategists weighed whether to compete in Georgia before deciding that other states provided an easier path to victory. Four years later, Mrs. Clinton won more raw votes than any Democratic nominee in history, a sign that some suburban revulsion for Mr. Trump had already begun.

Opposition to Mr. Trump accelerated the political changes in 2018, helping Democratic candidates flip a House seat and nearly win another in Atlanta’s suburbs. That seat flipped Democratic this month, so far the only straight Democratic pickup in the country. (Democrats also won two districts in North Carolina that had been redrawn to favor them.)

Meantime, Democrat Stacey Abrams lost the closest race for governor in a quarter century. Rather than try to woo more conservative white voters, Ms. Abrams focused on turning out intermittent and Black voters while embracing an unapologetically liberal platform.

A group she founded, the New Georgia Project, has registered hundreds of thousands of new voters and inspired other emerging activists.

Julius Thomas, 24, a risk analyst broker who grew up in the small coastal city of St. Marys, Ga., moved to Atlanta in 2018, the year Ms. Abrams lost the governor’s race but gained national stature.

Mr. Thomas helped found a nonprofit group, the People’s Uprising, whose voter registration drives have targeted young people of color — a recent Juneteenth drive featured Atlanta rappers like Lil Baby.

“There’s a culture shift that’s happening among young Black people where it’s no longer cool to sit out civically,” he said. “On your Twitter feed, you’re seeing people say, ‘If you haven’t voted, what’s wrong with you?’”

In the north Atlanta suburbs, Laurie Jules, 39, also Black, said she sees the change.

“In high school, voting was something my parents did,” said Ms. Jules, who is studying for a degree in business administration. “I have a teenager in high school who is a junior, and her and her friends talk about policies, politics. They go to rallies.”

Some of the changes in Georgia mirror the nation, with urban areas growing more Democratic, rural regions moving Republican and the suburbs left as the country’s political battlegrounds.

In Georgia’s suburbs, college-educated women have become a powerful force, forming volunteer networks and organizing for local and national candidates.

Taking a break from putting up Christmas decorations, Debbie O’Dekirk and Kassie Jones, two friends in the affluent northwest Atlanta suburbs, where neighborhoods are dotted with farmer’s markets and lush town squares, described how they had turned against Mr. Trump.

Ms. O’Dekirk, 67, initially liked that the president wasn’t a typical politician, voting for him in 2016. But she expected him to take guidance from more experienced Republican leaders once he entered office.

“The exact opposite happened,” said Ms. O’Dekirk, a retired retail executive from Cobb County. “It was the biggest disappointment I’ve ever had in my life, as far as any president.”

Ms. Jones, 68, supported Mrs. Clinton four years ago and was devastated when she lost. Since then, she has become increasingly vocal about her support for Democrats — a trend she sees in her suburban neighborhood where signs for both Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump dotted the lawns.

“When I first came to Georgia, it was just this private little society of Democrats,” said Ms. Jones, a former banker who moved to the state shortly before Mr. Trump was elected. “But the more concerned they got with the president, the more people started to speak up.”

Ms. Jones, who volunteered for Mr. Biden’s campaign, has already starting talking to her neighbors about the runoffs.

“I’m so proud to be part of Georgia now,” she said. “But we’ve got to get everyone to understand their job’s not done yet.”

"Biden’s team is stepping up transition plans, sketching out an administration.","Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s advisers accelerated their transition planning on Friday as election results showed him with an advantage in battleground states that could hand him the presidency, with the first senior officials in a potential Biden White House possibly named as early as next week.

In Wilmington and Washington, Mr. Biden’s advisers and allies are ramping up their conversations about who might fill critical posts, both in the West Wing and across federal agencies, guided heavily by Mr. Biden’s plan to assemble what would be the most diverse cabinet in history.

The behind-the-scenes activity underscored that even as Mr. Biden publicly offered a disciplined message about counting every vote and refrained from claiming victory, he was already mapping out a quick start in office as the nation faces a worsening pandemic and a damaged economy.

Biden advisers say that so far, officials in Mr. Trump’s government have worked with them in good faith, which they hope and expect will continue.

As coronavirus infections hit new highs, Mr. Biden’s aides are planning for the first critical transition decisions to focus on health care and addressing the pandemic, the central theme of his campaign in the final months. Transition officials are also looking at what types of economic actions could be taken almost immediately, including rolling back some of Mr. Trump’s executive orders.

“Men, women, gay, straight, center, across the board, Black, white, Asian,” Mr. Biden said this spring when talking about his prospective cabinet. “It really matters that you look like the country, because everyone brings a slightly different perspective.”"
The Key States Biden Won en Route to the White House,"After days of vote counting, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has amassed the 270 Electoral College votes he needed to secure the presidency.

All along, it was clear that Mr. Biden’s path to victory involved flipping a handful of states that then-candidate Donald J. Trump won in 2016 while also retaining the states that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee in 2016, won in that cycle.

Though there were many twists and turns, Mr. Biden appears to have done exactly that. Here is a quick look at the key states he won, and what we know about why he won them.

Pennsylvania has been in the spotlight for months, and it was long considered a potential “tipping-point state” — the state where victory could determine the outcome of the entire presidential contest. Elections officials had signaled all along that it would take time to count the votes there, and that a final tally would not be available on election night. Mr. Trump won the state by less than one percentage point in 2016, but polls had Mr. Biden ahead in the run-up to Election Day.

And although it took days to learn who had won and the race was quite close, Pennsylvania indeed proved critical to the outcome. As expected, Mr. Trump jumped out to an early lead, thanks to ballots cast on Election Day, but Mr. Biden clawed back slowly and eventually overtook Mr. Trump as more and more absentee ballots were counted.

An initial look at county-level data suggests that Mr. Biden ran ahead of Mrs. Clinton’s performance in 2016 in most parts of the state. He showed particular strength in the suburbs around Philadelphia, an area that had been trending blue in 2016 and has only grown bluer since. He flipped the state back into the Democratic column with 37,000 more votes than Mr. Trump.

Four years ago, Mr. Trump became the first Republican presidential candidate to win either Michigan or Wisconsin in decades when he defeated Mrs. Clinton by roughly 33,000 votes in both states combined.

From the start of Mr. Biden’s presidential campaign all the way to Election Day, he and his team believed that rebuilding the Democratic “blue wall” in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania would perhaps be the clearest and cleanest path to winning the White House. Mr. Biden also believed that the Democratic Party had to garner support from working-class and middle-class voters in Northern industrial states — those from families like the one he grew up in.

That strategy paid off, as Mr. Biden rode the support in Wisconsin’s cities and suburbs to victory. He was aided particularly by massive turnout in Dane County (home to Madison) and he ate into Mr. Trump’s margins in the Milwaukee suburbs.

In Michigan, a spike in turnout in Detroit and its wealthy suburbs, along with shrinking support for Mr. Trump among middle-class voters, helped secure the state for Mr. Biden. About two-thirds of the predominately white counties that backed Mr. Trump in 2016 moved somewhat left four years later, and a greater share of voters in those counties backed Mr. Biden than they supported Mrs. Clinton in 2016.

Mr. Trump came surprisingly close to a victory in Minnesota four years ago, and his campaign poured significant resources into the state this cycle in hopes of flipping it. Nonetheless, Mr. Biden maintained a comfortable if not insurmountable lead in Minnesota throughout much of the race, and polling there ended up being pretty spot on.

Mr. Biden won comfortably, by about seven percentage points. He ran up the margins in densely populated urban counties and made significant inroads in the suburban counties that Mr. Trump won in 2016.

Mr. Biden managed to hang onto Nevada, a state Mrs. Clinton won in 2016, but it was a nail-biter that took days to decide. Like Mrs. Clinton, he did it by winning Clark and Washoe Counties, home to Las Vegas and Reno, which account for over 85 percent of the state’s total votes. His margin of victory in Clark County was down slightly from the margin in 2016, but it was up in Washoe.

The Cook Political Report considered New Hampshire competitive with a Democratic lean, and it was tightly contested in 2016. But Mr. Biden won handily, by seven percentage points, and the race was called relatively quickly.

Perhaps no state was more closely watched this cycle than Florida, and the results there almost immediately dashed Democrats’ hopes of a blue landslide. Mr. Trump won the state by a significantly wider margin than he did in 2016, despite polling averages that showed him trailing before Election Day.

More than half of the counties in Florida swung further right than they did four years ago. And although Mr. Biden did make gains in some areas of the state, he vastly underperformed in Florida’s most populous county, Miami-Dade, especially in precincts with a majority Hispanic population.

Optimistic Democrats hopeful for a blue wave saw Iowa, Ohio and Texas as potentially in play this cycle, but that proved to be wishful thinking. Mr. Trump thumped Mr. Biden by significant margins in all three conservative-leaning states, winning them for a second time.

Of the three, Texas, where the president won by roughly six percentage points, ended up being the closest. Even as some white voters in urban and suburban areas moved in large numbers toward Democrats, many Hispanic voters in the Rio Grande Valley shifted decisively toward Mr. Trump.

Democrats cheer ‘historic’ win as race is called for Biden and Harris.,"Minutes after the 2020 presidential race was called for Joseph R. Biden Jr., and Kamala Harris, prominent Democrats supportive of the former Vice President and his running mate cheered their victory as the first step toward a brighter American future.

Democrats who ran against Mr. Biden in the 2020 primary including former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend Ind., the climate activist Tom Steyer and Senators Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts all offered their congratulations.

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the most well-known figures on the progressive left, also offered kind words, as did world leaders such as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada.

And former President Barack Obama sent out his own statement praising Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris in which he said his former vice president would “do the job” of president with “the best interests of every American at heart.”

“I encourage every American to give him a chance and lend him your support,” Mr. Obama said.

Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, whose endorsement as the state’s Democratic primary approached was a key turning point in the race and a huge boost to Mr. Biden said his win “marks a new chapter for our country.”

“As we face unprecedented challenges, Americans have chosen you to lead us out of the chaos and to build a stronger community,” he wrote on Twitter. “Today, I am hopeful for a brighter future.”

Maya Harris, Ms. Harris’s sister, immediately invoked the memory of their mother, Shyamala, whom the vice president-elect often discussed during the campaign when telling her back story and sharing her values. Julia Louis-Dreyfus, the actress who for years played a female vice president in the HBO comedy “Veep,” made sure to note: “‘Madam Vice President’ is no longer a fictional character.“

The Trump campaign, for its part, said it would continue to pursue its legal challenges, and Mr. Trump released a statement in which he said he would “not rest until the American People have the honest vote count they deserve and that Democracy demands.”

Newt Gingrich, the former Republican Speaker of the House and one of Mr. Trump’s staunchest supporters, baselessly insisted that the media had jumped the gun and declared a winner in the race before recounts had started and legal challenges had unfolded.

Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, similarly objected to the presidential race call on Saturday. “The media do not get to determine who the president is. The people do. When all lawful votes have been counted, recounts finished, and allegations of fraud addressed, we will know who the winner is.”

But in one of the first statements to surface from a Republican lawmaker on Saturday, Representative Fred Upton of Michigan affirmed a Biden victory. “I am raising my hand and committing to working with President-elect Biden,” he said.

Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, extended his own congratulations to Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris, conferring the titles “president-elect” and “vice president-elect” on them in his tweeted statement.

“We know both of them as people of good will and admirable character,” he said. “We pray that God may bless them in the days and years ahead.”

And Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida who failed to defeat Mr. Trump in the 2016 Republican primary, said it was time to “heal deep wounds” and added that he would be “praying” for Mr. Biden’s success. (An earlier version of this briefing item described the primary incorrectly; Mr. Bush and Mr. Trump did not run as Democrats.)

The specter of a prolonged legal battle could not temper the enthusiasm of Democratic Party leaders who have known and worked with Mr. Biden for years.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in a statement, said that voters had “elected a unifier who values faith, family and community, and who will work tirelessly to heal our nation.” And Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, said the American people had “placed their faith in Joe Biden and Kamala Harris” to confront challenges posed by the virus, the economy and global warming in the coming years.

In statement, Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee said that by electing Mr. Biden, “The American people chose hope"" and “dignity and opportunity for all.”

“This is a historic victory,” he said.

“To the families of those who’ve lost loved ones to COVID-19, and to all our Americans yearning for change, our message is simple: You will finally get the leadership you deserve.”

And Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic nominee who won the popular vote but ultimately lost to Mr. Trump, said voters had issued a “repudiation” of the president and offered a riff on one of her campaign slogans.

“Thank you to everyone who helped make this happen,” she said. “Onward, together.”

Read Joe Biden’s President-Elect Acceptance Speech: Full Transcript,"

Joseph R. Biden Jr., a 77-year-old former vice president and longtime senator who has sought the White House on and off for more than three decades, on Saturday renewed his commitment to unifying and serving all Americans at a time the nation is deeply divided along sharply drawn partisan lines.

In a roughly 17-minute address, Mr. Biden, speaking for the first time as president-elect, promised to lead with compassion, decency and character and heal the nation’s soul. As he has for months, Mr. Biden also promised to immediately address the coronavirus pandemic and work to stop its spread, an effort he said would be key to economic recovery.

And to conclude, he returned to the idea that there is nothing Americans can’t do if they work together.

“Let us be the nation that we know we can be,” he said. “A nation united, a nation strengthened, a nation healed.”

Here is a transcript of Mr. Biden’s remarks as they were prepared for delivery.

My fellow Americans, the people of this nation have spoken.

They have delivered us a clear victory. A convincing victory.

A victory for “We the People.”

We have won with the most votes ever cast for a presidential ticket in the history of this nation — 74 million.

I am humbled by the trust and confidence you have placed in me.

I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide, but to unify.

Who doesn’t see red and blue states, but a United States.

And who will work with all my heart to win the confidence of the whole people.

For that is what America is about: the people.

And that is what our administration will be about.

I sought this office to restore the soul of America.

To rebuild the backbone of the nation — the middle class.

To make America respected around the world again and to unite us here at home.

It is the honor of my lifetime that so many millions of Americans have voted for this vision.

And now the work of making this vision real is the task of our time.

As I said many times before, I’m Jill’s husband.

I would not be here without the love and tireless support of Jill, Hunter, Ashley, all of our grandchildren and their spouses, and all our family.

They are my heart.

Jill’s a mom — a military mom — and an educator.

She has dedicated her life to education, but teaching isn’t just what she does — it’s who she is. For America’s educators, this is a great day: You’re going to have one of your own in the White House, and Jill is going to make a great first lady.

And I will be honored to be serving with a fantastic vice president — Kamala Harris — who will make history as the first woman, first Black woman, first woman of South Asian descent, and first daughter of immigrants ever elected to national office in this country.

It’s long overdue, and we’re reminded tonight of all those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. But once again, America has bent the arc of the moral universe towards justice.

Kamala, Doug — like it or not — you’re family. You’ve become honorary Bidens and there’s no way out.

To all those who volunteered, worked the polls in the middle of this pandemic, local election officials — you deserve a special thanks from this nation.

To my campaign team, and all the volunteers, to all those who gave so much of themselves to make this moment possible, I owe you everything.

And to all those who supported us: I am proud of the campaign we built and ran. I am proud of the coalition we put together, the broadest and most diverse in history.

Democrats, Republicans and Independents.

Progressives, moderates and conservatives.

Young and old.

Urban, suburban and rural.

Gay, straight, transgender.

White. Latino. Asian. Native American.

And especially for those moments when this campaign was at its lowest — the African-American community stood up again for me. They always have my back, and I’ll have yours.

I said from the outset I wanted a campaign that represented America, and I think we did that. Now that’s what I want the administration to look like.

And to those who voted for President Trump, I understand your disappointment tonight.

I’ve lost a couple of elections myself.

But now, let’s give each other a chance.

It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric.

To lower the temperature.

To see each other again.

To listen to each other again.

To make progress, we must stop treating our opponents as our enemy. We are not enemies. We are Americans.

The Bible tells us that to everything there is a season — a time to build, a time to reap, a time to sow. And a time to heal.

This is the time to heal in America.

Now that the campaign is over — what is the people’s will? What is our mandate?

I believe it is this: Americans have called on us to marshal the forces of decency and the forces of fairness. To marshal the forces of science and the forces of hope in the great battles of our time.

The battle to control the virus.

The battle to build prosperity.

The battle to secure your family’s health care.

The battle to achieve racial justice and root out systemic racism in this country.

The battle to save the climate.

The battle to restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot.

Our work begins with getting Covid under control.

We cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life’s most precious moments — hugging a grandchild, birthdays, weddings, graduations, all the moments that matter most to us — until we get this virus under control.

On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisers to help take the Biden-Harris Covid plan and convert it into an action blueprint that starts on Jan. 20, 2021.

That plan will be built on a bedrock of science. It will be constructed out of compassion, empathy, and concern.

I will spare no effort — or commitment — to turn this pandemic around.

I ran as a proud Democrat. I will now be an American president. I will work as hard for those who didn’t vote for me — as those who did.

Let this grim era of demonization in America begin to end — here and now.

The refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not due to some mysterious force beyond our control.

It’s a decision. It’s a choice we make.

And if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I believe that this is part of the mandate from the American people. They want us to cooperate.

That’s the choice I’ll make. And I call on the Congress — Democrats and Republicans alike — to make that choice with me.

The American story is about the slow, yet steady widening of opportunity.

Make no mistake: Too many dreams have been deferred for too long.

We must make the promise of the country real for everybody — no matter their race, their ethnicity, their faith, their identity, or their disability.

America has always been shaped by inflection points — by moments in time where we’ve made hard decisions about who we are and what we want to be.

Lincoln in 1860 — coming to save the Union.

F.D.R. in 1932 — promising a beleaguered country a New Deal.

J.F.K. in 1960 — pledging a New Frontier.

And 12 years ago — when Barack Obama made history — and told us, “Yes, we can.”

We stand again at an inflection point.

We have the opportunity to defeat despair and to build a nation of prosperity and purpose.

We can do it. I know we can.

I’ve long talked about the battle for the soul of America.

We must restore the soul of America.

Our nation is shaped by the constant battle between our better angels and our darkest impulses.

It is time for our better angels to prevail.

Tonight, the whole world is watching America. I believe at our best America is a beacon for the globe.

And we lead not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.

I’ve always believed we can define America in one word: possibilities.

That in America everyone should be given the opportunity to go as far as their dreams and God-given ability will take them.

You see, I believe in the possibility of this country.

We’re always looking ahead.

Ahead to an America that’s freer and more just.

Ahead to an America that creates jobs with dignity and respect.

Ahead to an America that cures disease — like cancer and Alzheimers.

Ahead to an America that never leaves anyone behind.

Ahead to an America that never gives up, never gives in.

This is a great nation.

And we are a good people.

This is the United States of America.

And there has never been anything we haven’t been able to do when we’ve done it together.

In the last days of the campaign, I’ve been thinking about a hymn that means a lot to me and to my family, particularly my deceased son, Beau. It captures the faith that sustains me and which I believe sustains America.

And I hope it can provide some comfort and solace to the more than 230,000 families who have lost a loved one to this terrible virus this year. My heart goes out to each and every one of you. Hopefully this hymn gives you solace as well.

“And He will raise you up on eagle’s wings,

Bear you on the breath of dawn,

Make you to shine like the sun,

And hold you in the palm of His Hand.”

And now, together — on eagle’s wings — we embark on the work that God and history have called upon us to do.

With full hearts and steady hands, with faith in America and in each other, with a love of country — and a thirst for justice — let us be the nation that we know we can be.

A nation united.

A nation strengthened.

A nation healed.

The United States of America.

God bless you.

And may God protect our troops."
"Biden, Now President-Elect, Calls for End to ‘Grim Era of Demonization’","WILMINGTON, Del. — Joseph R. Biden Jr. addressed the nation for the first time as president-elect on Saturday night, delivering a message of unity and trying to soothe the extraordinary divisions that defined the last four years in American politics.

“Let this grim era of demonization in America begin to end here and now,” he said.

In remarks before a drive-in audience in Wilmington brimming with longtime friends from Delaware, his home state, he directly appealed to the tens of millions of Americans who backed President Trump’s re-election, seeking to make good on his central campaign promise of bringing the country together. 

“For all those of you who voted for President Trump, I understand the disappointment tonight,” Mr. Biden, speaking at the conclusion of his third run for the presidency, said. “I’ve lost a couple times myself. But now, let’s give each other a chance. It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, listen to each other again.”

He added, “This is the time to heal in America.”

Mr. Biden’s optimistic speech, flecked with references to faith and American history, came 48 years to the day after he was first elected a senator from Delaware. He spoke from a flag-bedecked stage outside the Chase Center on the Riverfront, an event center near the Christina River, where he invoked themes that shaped his presidential campaign. 

The message, as it was throughout the campaign, was rooted more in a sense of values than in an especially ideological viewpoint, an approach that helped him build a broad coalition throughout the campaign but will be tested in partisan Washington.

Yet Mr. Biden grew impassioned as he insisted that for all of the tensions in the country, Americans still wanted to see their leaders find common ground. He promised to bring steady leadership and experience to meet the staggering crises facing the nation, most prominently the coronavirus. 

“What is our mandate?” he said. “I believe it’s this: Americans have called upon us to marshal the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to marshal the forces of science and the forces of hope in the great battles of our time.”

Senator Kamala Harris, the vice president-elect, spoke first, telling voters that they had chosen “hope and unity, decency, science and, yes, truth.” 

She invoked her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, who came to the United States from India at the age of 19, and paid tribute to the women “who throughout our nation’s history have paved the way for this moment tonight.”

“While I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last,” she said. “Because every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities.”

In his 15-minute speech, Mr. Biden noted the history-making nature of Ms. Harris’s election, and he sketched out a vision for taking on the pandemic that has gripped the nation and killed more than 237,000 people in the United States.

After a campaign in which he emphasized the importance of political compromise, he implored Republicans and Democrats to work together — though some in his party have viewed his outlook as outmoded and unrealistic in an age of deep political polarization. 

And after running for the White House stressing the need to restore what he called “the soul of America,” he urged the country to come together. 

“I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide, but unify,” Mr. Biden said at the outset of his speech, wasting no time before calling for togetherness. “Who doesn’t see red states and blue states, only sees the United States.”

Onlookers, some of whom had been waiting for hours to see him, sat on the rooftops of cars, waved red and blue glow sticks, and leaned on their horns to demonstrate their support. The audience, Mr. Biden said, included a number of Delaware dignitaries — and, ever the former senator himself, he greeted several of them by name.

After he concluded, Mr. Biden, Ms. Harris and their families remained onstage — and some of them danced — as an elaborate fireworks and drone light show unfolded. “Biden,” “President Elect,” “46” and “Harris” flashed across the Wilmington sky.

Mr. Biden had already appeared outside the Chase Center once this past week, on election night, when in brief remarks he said he was “on track to win this election.” In the days that followed, he limited himself to short and measured public statements as he and his team waited for news organizations to call the race and many of his supporters grew anxious.

Before he spoke, Mr. Biden addressed his campaign staff in a private video call, during which he thanked them for their efforts and insisted on the importance of engaging Americans who had supported Mr. Trump.

“I would urge you to reach out, you know, that person who had that Trump sign in their lawn next door or down the street,” he told his team. “Reach out to them. Tell them: ‘This isn’t personal. This is about getting together and restoring the basic values we’ve had for generations and generations here in America.’”

Mr. Biden also acknowledged the vast challenges confronting the nation and the huge responsibilities facing his team.

“The rest of the country is looking to us, the rest of the world is looking to us,” he said. “So we’re going to make sure that both the country is moving toward being united and the world that’s in disarray, the message is: America’s back.”

On Saturday, Mr. Biden spoke with former President Barack Obama, who congratulated him, as well as with the top Democrats in Congress, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York. At one point, Mr. Schumer held up his flip phone so Mr. Biden could hear people cheering for him in Brooklyn.

Meanwhile, Mr. Biden’s advisers and allies were giving serious thought to the transition period, for which they have been planning for months.

Representative Cedric L. Richmond of Louisiana, a national co-chair of Mr. Biden’s campaign and a possible future member of his administration, made clear that combating the virus would be a top priority of the president-elect’s in the coming days.

“He has a chance to take a breath, but I’m not sure that he will, because I know he’s so concerned about Covid,” Mr. Richmond said. “He’ll be up in the morning working on America’s Covid response.”

"
Biden’s Big Challenge,"The New York Times has called the race in Pennsylvania for Joe Biden, and with it, the presidency of the United States. He has defeated Donald Trump, who becomes the country’s first one-term commander in chief in nearly three decades.

It was the culmination of a race that Mr. Biden entered, he often said, only after being outraged by the sight of white nationalists marching in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017. The episode appeared to harden his resolution to mount a centrist campaign that would reject extremism and pull the country together.

CNN was the first network to call the race this morning, with The Associated Press and others soon following. “With the campaign over, it’s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation,” the Biden campaign said in a statement heralding the triumph.

But it’s not exactly the victory that polls had predicted, or that Democrats had envisioned. Mr. Trump may have lost, but Trumpism is far from dead. And, not surprisingly, he is so far continuing to dispute Mr. Biden’s win; there’s little guarantee of a smooth transition.

So as the nation confronts a pandemic and an economic crisis, it’s also facing down a crisis of consensus. Rather than expanding on their sweeping victories in the 2018 midterms, Democrats are on pace to lose seats in the House, and face an uphill battle to gaining control of the Senate. While Mr. Biden won more popular votes than any presidential candidate in history, Mr. Trump earned the second-most.

Mr. Biden had centered his entire campaign on a promise to unite the country. Accepting the Democratic nomination in August, he pledged to “restore the soul of America.” But after this week’s election, Americans are just as split as ever on what that soul contains.

“I don’t think there is any question that the results reveal the continuation of some of the stratification of the country,” said Guy Cecil, the chairman of Priorities USA, a Democratic political action committee.

Only a small fraction of voters — 5 percent, according to early exit poll results — decided whom they would support in the immediate run-up to the election. Partisan allegiances were even stronger than four years ago: Well over 90 percent of Democrats and Republicans voted for their party’s nominee.

In Philadelphia on Friday night, as elections officials counted votes at the city’s convention center, a symbolic scene unfolded outside, with Trump supporters gathered on one side of a police barricade, demanding an end to the count, and Mr. Biden’s backers gathered just steps away. Some on the Biden side were playing music out of amplifiers; soon, a rig of amps had materialized on the Trump side, and a different soundtrack began to blare there.

In nearby Scranton, Pa., our correspondent Sabrina Tavernise spoke to voters and got a front-row view of the political polarization. Sammy Diana, a 55-year-old Trump supporter, described himself as “sick to my stomach” as the results rolled in yesterday, and refused to accept their legitimacy. “I definitely, definitely, definitely believe it was fixed. Dead people voted,” he said, echoing some of the unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud made by Mr. Trump and his allies.

Still, almost all voters in Tuesday’s election — 96 percent, according to the preliminary results of The Associated Press’s VoteCast survey — said that bridging the country’s divides should be at least a somewhat important priority for the next president. Among the roughly four in five voters who said this was very important, most cast ballots for Mr. Biden. His focus on unity was evidently not misplaced.

The surest way a leader can pull a divided country together, especially if he or she isn’t a dynamic speaker or a movement figure, is by winning resoundingly, then sweeping into power amid an inevitable air of consensus. Instead, Biden and his Democratic allies in Congress will face a Republican Party feeling emboldened, with a base of support that has only grown in the past four years. After presiding over a chaotic four years as president, Mr. Trump may go down in history as more successful at building a reliable base of Republican supporters than at governing.

The range of Republican victories in the House on Tuesday speaks to that. The class of freshman Republicans in Congress will range from Marjorie Taylor Greene, an avowed supporter of the QAnon conspiracy theory, representing a rural and suburban Georgia district, to Maria Elvira Salazar, a Cuban-American former TV journalist, who unseated a Democratic incumbent in the heart of Miami.

Should Mr. Biden face a divided Congress when he steps into the Oval Office, taking big legislative steps forward will be difficult. If campaigns are waged in poetry and governing is done in prose, Mr. Biden is swiftly moving into the prosaic stage. Discourses on national healing may soon dissolve in favor of a hard-nosed focus on partisan politics.

While Mr. Biden was famous during his years in the Senate for establishing mutual respect across the aisle and forging alliances with Republicans, those days may be gone.

And so now the spotlight falls on Georgia, where two Senate seats are heading to January runoff elections. They appear likely to determine which party controls the Senate next year.

“Yes, we can put political pressure on Republican senators; yes, we can launch national campaigns to pass legislation,” Mr. Cecil said. “But ultimately, if we’re just judging Mitch McConnell by history, he has shown very little interest in working together.”

He added, “We should put all that we can into the two Georgia Senate races and see if we can pull them off.”

‘A New Day in America’: Biden Victory Prompts Spontaneous Celebrations,"CHICAGO — People shouting from their windows, ringing cowbells on their porches and blaring car horns in the streets: As the news spread through cellphones and television screens that Joseph R. Biden Jr. had won the presidential election, spontaneous celebrations erupted within minutes across the nation, and many persisted as street parties into the night.

In Chicago on Saturday morning, hundreds poured onto Clark Street, waving American flags, cheering and hugging. Demoz Desta, 29, emerged from a grocery store, stunned at the sudden commotion.

“I thought the Cubs won the World Series for a second,” he said. “This feels so good to see everybody so happy. It feels good to know that I’m not the only one. And we haven’t had a chance to be happy together for so long.”

Even as Mr. Trump vowed to continue fighting the election results, and his supporters gathered in tense scenes at state capitols to insist without evidence that the election had been marred by fraud, the scene in many cities was one of jubilation: In Los Angeles, impromptu celebrations broke out on street corners. In Seattle, people shot off fireworks. In New York, crowds flooded into Times Square, and Senator Chuck Schumer, in a call to Mr. Biden from Brooklyn, held up his phone so the president-elect could hear the borough’s celebrations.

By nightfall, drummers were leading a celebratory march through the streets of Philadelphia and a mariachi band was playing to crowds in Washington, D.C.

“It’s a new day in America,” said Barry Karas, 74, a retired actor and political activist, who was hoisting two Biden signs onto his wrought-iron fence in Washington. Passers-by shouted back, including a man wearing a blue medical mask who said, “If it wasn’t a pandemic, I’d hug you!”

Nearby, the driver of a silver Toyota Prius repeatedly honked its horn, joggers held their arms up in jubilation and a woman on a bicycle rode through the intersection, shouting with joy.

As supporters of Mr. Biden celebrated, crowds of Trump supporters gathered with vows to continue fighting the results, and tense scenes began to unfold at competing events.

In Harrisburg, Pa., while some Biden supporters danced in celebration, carrying signs bearing messages like “The People Have Spoken,” hundreds of supporters of Mr. Trump gathered for hours, chanting “Stop the steal,” embracing the president’s baseless claims of election fraud. Many carried long guns, and police intervened to keep opposing groups separated.

One man who identified himself as part of the far-right Proud Boys, a group notorious for violence, held a sign that said “Standing Back, Standing By, Mr. President” — a reference to Mr. Trump’s comments about the group during a presidential debate in September.

In Salem, Ore., videos showed a person wearing Proud Boys apparel using pepper spray on someone, and another person in the crowd throwing a punch.

In Lansing, Mich., Trump supporters chanted: “Whose streets? Our streets!” and repeated Mr. Trump’s false contention that he had won the election. There was a brief fight in the crowd, which included armed people on both sides.

Curtis Udell, 56, who was standing with an AR-15 rifle, said that he still held out hope for Mr. Trump. “They’re never going to convince me that he didn’t win,” he said.

Half a dozen people were standing nearby, waving Biden signs at passing cars. Justine Robinson, a 26-year-old activist from Grand Rapids, said she had initially supported Bernie Sanders but was happy with Mr. Biden’s win. “He’s not the candidate I wanted, but he’s better than Trump,” she said. “There’s still a lot of disappointment.”

The gatherings developed as Mr. Trump signaled that he intended to continue fighting the election tallies, which showed Mr. Biden with an advantage of four million votes nationwide and on track to win more than 300 electoral votes.

Minutes after Mr. Biden was projected to have won the presidency, a crowd of several dozen Trump supporters stood in a cold fog in front of the State Capitol in Bismarck, N.D., as the national anthem played. They had come to protest what they saw as a fraudulent election and to show support for Mr. Trump.

“It sickens me,” said Ken Weigel, who drove nearly two hours to attend the protest. He said he would not accept Mr. Biden as president.

In Miami, about two dozen Trump supporters, mostly Cuban-Americans, gathered outside a restaurant to protest the projected Biden victory. Drivers honked their horns, waving “Make America Great Again” hats out their driver windows, as some people waving Biden flags driving in the opposite direction shouted, “Go home!”

The protesters shouted back, “We are not socialists!”

In downtown Los Angeles, where an anti-Trump rally had been planned by liberal groups including Black Lives Matter supporters to protest the president’s efforts to contest the election, the event quickly became a site of celebration.

“I feel liberated,” said Linda Gomez, 37, an activist who has worked to promote rights for convicted felons and who herself was formerly incarcerated. She added, “Today is the people’s day.”

Ms. Gomez, like others there, said voting out President Trump would not be enough to achieve the changes voters were seeking.

“We have to make sure things are implemented,” she said. “We have to hold Biden accountable.”

Sitting outside the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Christian Hanna, 31, stopped his afternoon bike ride to take in the election news after he noticed his phone, balanced on the handlebars of his bike, “blowing up” with the updates.

Mr. Hanna is a registered Republican who said he disagreed with the divisive tone of Mr. Trump’s speeches and also disagreed with parts of Mr. Biden’s record. He said he had voted for a third-party candidate, Jo Jorgensen.

He said some of his friends on social media were popping bottles of Champagne, while others were saying, “Fight this, fight this.” He read a tweet from Mr. Trump in which the president claimed to have won the election and said it made him think wistfully about how John McCain had accepted defeat in 2008.

“I believe in decorum,” said Mr. Hanna, who added that he was considering changing his registration to independent. “I believe in handling wins and handling losses with grace.”

Across the street, four sheriff’s deputies sat in an unmarked black S.U.V., keeping an eye out.

"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Biden’s Win, House Losses, and What’s Next for the Left","For months, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been a good soldier for the Democratic Party and Joseph R. Biden Jr. as he sought to defeat President Trump.

But on Saturday, in a nearly hourlong interview shortly after President-elect Biden was declared the winner, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez made clear the divisions within the party that animated the primary still exist. And she dismissed recent criticisms from some Democratic House members who have blamed the party’s left for costing them important seats. Some of the members who lost, she said, had made themselves “sitting ducks.”

These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

We finally have a fuller understanding of the results. What’s your macro takeaway?

Well, I think the central one is that we aren’t in a free fall to hell anymore. But whether we’re going to pick ourselves up or not is the lingering question. We paused this precipitous descent. And the question is if and how we will build ourselves back up.

We know that race is a problem, and avoiding it is not going to solve any electoral issues. We have to actively disarm the potent influence of racism at the polls.

But we also learned that progressive policies do not hurt candidates. Every single candidate that co-sponsored Medicare for All in a swing district kept their seat. We also know that co-sponsoring the Green New Deal was not a sinker. Mike Levin was an original co-sponsor of the legislation, and he kept his seat.

To your first point, Democrats lost seats in an election where they were expected to gain them. Is that what you are ascribing to racism and white supremacy at the polls?

I think it’s going to be really important how the party deals with this internally, and whether the party is going to be honest about doing a real post-mortem and actually digging into why they lost. Because before we even had any data yet in a lot of these races, there was already finger-pointing that this was progressives’ fault and that this was the fault of the Movement for Black Lives.

I’ve already started looking into the actual functioning of these campaigns. And the thing is, I’ve been unseating Democrats for two years. I have been defeating Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee-run campaigns for two years. That’s how I got to Congress. That’s how we elected Ayanna Pressley. That’s how Jamaal Bowman won. That’s how Cori Bush won. And so we know about extreme vulnerabilities in how Democrats run campaigns.

Some of this is criminal. It’s malpractice. Conor Lamb spent $2,000 on Facebook the week before the election. I don’t think anybody who is not on the internet in a real way in the Year of our Lord 2020 and loses an election can blame anyone else when you’re not even really on the internet.

And I’ve looked through a lot of these campaigns that lost, and the fact of the matter is if you’re not spending $200,000 on Facebook with fund-raising, persuasion, volunteer recruitment, get-out-the-vote the week before the election, you are not firing on all cylinders. And not a single one of these campaigns were firing on all cylinders.

Well, Conor Lamb did win. So what are you saying: Investment in digital advertising and canvassing are a greater reason moderate Democrats lost than any progressive policy?

These folks are pointing toward Republican messaging that they feel killed them, right? But why were you so vulnerable to that attack?

If you’re not door-knocking, if you’re not on the internet, if your main points of reliance are TV and mail, then you’re not running a campaign on all cylinders. I just don’t see how anyone could be making ideological claims when they didn’t run a full-fledged campaign.

Our party isn’t even online, not in a real way that exhibits competence. And so, yeah, they were vulnerable to these messages, because they weren’t even on the mediums where these messages were most potent. Sure, you can point to the message, but they were also sitting ducks. They were sitting ducks.

There’s a reason Barack Obama built an entire national campaign apparatus outside of the Democratic National Committee. And there’s a reason that when he didn’t activate or continue that, we lost House majorities. Because the party — in and of itself — does not have the core competencies, and no amount of money is going to fix that.

If I lost my election, and I went out and I said: “This is moderates’ fault. This is because you didn’t let us have a floor vote on Medicare for all.” And they opened the hood on my campaign, and they found that I only spent $5,000 on TV ads the week before the election? They would laugh. And that’s what they look like right now trying to blame the Movement for Black Lives for their loss.

Is there anything from Tuesday that surprised you? Or made you rethink your previously held views?

The share of white support for Trump. I thought the polling was off, but just seeing it, there was that feeling of realizing what work we have to do.

We need to do a lot of anti-racist, deep canvassing in this country. Because if we keep losing white shares and just allowing Facebook to radicalize more and more elements of white voters and the white electorate, there’s no amount of people of color and young people that you can turn out to offset that.

But the problem is that right now, I think a lot of Dem strategy is to avoid actually working through this. Just trying to avoid poking the bear. That’s their argument with defunding police, right? To not agitate racial resentment. I don’t think that is sustainable.

There’s a lot of magical thinking in Washington, that this is just about special people that kind of come down from on high. Year after year, we decline the idea that they did work and ran sophisticated operations in favor of the idea that they are magical, special people. I need people to take these goggles off and realize how we can do things better.

If you are the D.C.C.C., and you’re hemorrhaging incumbent candidates to progressive insurgents, you would think that you may want to use some of those firms. But instead, we banned them. So the D.C.C.C. banned every single firm that is the best in the country at digital organizing.

The leadership and elements of the party — frankly, people in some of the most important decision-making positions in the party — are becoming so blinded to this anti-activist sentiment that they are blinding themselves to the very assets that they offer.

I’ve been begging the party to let me help them for two years. That’s also the damn thing of it. I’ve been trying to help. Before the election, I offered to help every single swing district Democrat with their operation. And every single one of them, but five, refused my help. And all five of the vulnerable or swing district people that I helped secured victory or are on a path to secure victory. And every single one that rejected my help is losing. And now they’re blaming us for their loss.

So I need my colleagues to understand that we are not the enemy. And that their base is not the enemy. That the Movement for Black Lives is not the enemy, that Medicare for all is not the enemy. This isn’t even just about winning an argument. It’s that if they keep going after the wrong thing, I mean, they’re just setting up their own obsolescence.

What is your expectation as to how open the Biden administration will be to the left? And what is the strategy in terms of moving it?

I don’t know how open they’ll be. And it’s not a personal thing. It’s just, the history of the party tends to be that we get really excited about the grass roots to get elected. And then those communities are promptly abandoned right after an election.

I think the transition period is going to indicate whether the administration is taking a more open and collaborative approach, or whether they’re taking a kind of icing-out approach. Because Obama’s transition set a trajectory for 2010 and some of our House losses. It was a lot of those transition decisions — and who was put in positions of leadership — that really informed, unsurprisingly, the strategy of governance.

What if the administration is hostile? If they take the John Kasich view of who Joe Biden should be? What do you do?

Well, I’d be bummed, because we’re going to lose. And that’s just what it is. These transition appointments, they send a signal. They tell a story of who the administration credits with this victory. And so it’s going be really hard after immigrant youth activists helped potentially deliver Arizona and Nevada. It’s going to be really hard after Detroit and Rashida Tlaib ran up the numbers in her district.

It’s really hard for us to turn out nonvoters when they feel like nothing changes for them. When they feel like people don’t see them, or even acknowledge their turnout.

If the party believes after 94 percent of Detroit went to Biden, after Black organizers just doubled and tripled turnout down in Georgia, after so many people organized Philadelphia, the signal from the Democratic Party is the John Kasichs won us this election? I mean, I can’t even describe how dangerous that is.

You are diagnosing national trends. You’re maybe the most famous voice on the left currently. What can we expect from you in the next four years?

I don’t know. I think I’ll have probably more answers as we get through transition, and to the next term. How the party responds will very much inform my approach and what I think is going to be necessary.

The last two years have been pretty hostile. Externally, we’ve been winning. Externally, there’s been a ton of support, but internally, it’s been extremely hostile to anything that even smells progressive.

Is the party ready to, like, sit down and work together and figure out how we’re going to use the assets from everyone at the party? Or are they going to just kind of double down on this smothering approach? And that’s going to inform what I do.

Is there a universe in which they’re hostile enough that we’re talking about a Senate run in a couple years?

I genuinely don’t know. I don’t even know if I want to be in politics. You know, for real, in the first six months of my term, I didn’t even know if I was going to run for re-election this year.

Really? Why?

It’s the incoming. It’s the stress. It’s the violence. It’s the lack of support from your own party. It’s your own party thinking you’re the enemy. When your own colleagues talk anonymously in the press and then turn around and say you’re bad because you actually append your name to your opinion.

I chose to run for re-election because I felt like I had to prove that this is real. That this movement was real. That I wasn’t a fluke. That people really want guaranteed health care and that people really want the Democratic Party to fight for them.

But I’m serious when I tell people the odds of me running for higher office and the odds of me just going off trying to start a homestead somewhere — they’re probably the same."
"Denial, and Resignation, From Trump and a Handful of Aides","WASHINGTON — President Trump’s motorcade was just pulling into the Trump National Golf Club in suburban Virginia on Saturday morning when news organizations ended days of waiting and declared that he had lost the presidency to Joseph R. Biden Jr.

Aides called Mr. Trump to let him know that their predictions over the past several days had come true: Every major news outlet had projected Mr. Biden to be the winner. But the president — who an hour earlier had said on Twitter that “I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!” — was not surprised, they said. And he did not change his plans to go ahead with legal challenges to the election results that several of his own advisers warned him were long shots at best, or to play golf.

The aides said Mr. Trump had no plans to immediately deliver the kind of concession speech that has become traditional in past presidential elections, and his campaign vowed to continue waging the legal battle across the country. In a statement issued while he was still on the golf course, Mr. Trump said Mr. Biden was trying to “falsely pose” as the winner.

“The simple fact is this election is far from over,” the president said, “Beginning Monday, our campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated.”

Mr. Trump’s advisers said the president has refused to acknowledge that he has lost, maintaining his baseless accusation that Democrats had stolen the election.

But they do not believe he will try in any way to block Mr. Biden from taking office, and said that if he has not delivered a formal concession speech by the time he departs, pressure may mount on his Republican allies, family members and friends to convince him that he must give in to the inevitable and let the American people know that he accepts their judgment.

Even some of Mr. Trump’s oldest advisers, like former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, have said publicly that he needed to have actual evidence to make the claims he has been making about the election.

“This kind of thing, all it does is inflame without informing. And we cannot permit inflammation without information,” Mr. Christie said on ABC News on Thursday night.

Now that Mr. Biden has been declared the winner, White House advisers must confront the reality that Mr. Trump will be a lame-duck president for the next two and a half months.

Since early Wednesday morning, when Mr. Trump angrily declared the election to be a “fraud” on the public, he has split his time between the Oval Office and the presidential residence, watching television coverage and brooding.

Besides his children, he has spoken by phone and at the White House with a coterie of advisers, including the former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, his campaign manager, Bill Stepien, his deputy campaign manager, Justin Clark, his adviser Hope Hicks, and Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee.

Vice President Mike Pence spent part of Friday in the Oval Office with Mr. Trump, but the president’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, who tested positive for the coronavirus the day after the election, has been working remotely on the campaign’s current legal challenges.

Mr. Trump’s advisers did succeed in persuading Rudolph W. Giuliani, his personal lawyer, to stand down from some of his public allegations about fraud. But Mr. Giuliani appealed to Mr. Trump, and the president signed off on his holding a news conference in Philadelphia that started just after news outlets called the presidential race for Mr. Biden.

Some aides were candid with Mr. Trump that there was not much of a path forward, even though they said they would continue on. Only a few had doubted that Mr. Biden was likely to win, among them the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, people who spoke with Mr. Trump said.

As he played golf on Saturday, aides said, Mr. Trump was surprisingly calm, given the news he had received when he arrived at the club.

But that was before he watched television coverage of Mr. Biden’s victory. Nearly two hours after an uneventful return to the White House, Mr. Trump again began posting angry, and false, tweets insisting that he had won the election and complaining that “MILLIONS OF MAIL-IN BALLOTS WERE SENT TO PEOPLE WHO NEVER ASKED FOR THEM!”

Several Trump advisers said that while they now wanted to give the president space to process the loss, they were exhausted after four years of tumult, and were eager for clarity about what would come next.

Some aides began to focus on what they believed Mr. Trump could cite as accomplishments even in defeat, including the fact that he received the second-most votes in American history and that he drew a new batch of voters into the Republican Party.

Confined almost entirely to the White House since Election Day, Mr. Trump is eager to get out of Washington, and after musing about holding a rally this week, aides said he was likely to travel to his private club, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Fla., instead. But the president has no intention of ending the boisterous demonstrations of support that he has held throughout his presidency and that always seem to energize him.

It was unclear whether Mr. Trump would follow tradition and invite Mr. Biden to the White House for a symbolic meeting like the one he had with President Barack Obama during his own transition four years ago. It is also tradition for the departing president to attend the inauguration of his successor, but Mr. Trump has ignored many of the norms of the office.

Mr. Biden, as a former vice president, does not require the tour of the White House that Mr. Trump did. Such a meeting would send a signal that could help reduce the anger of the president’s supporters over his defeat — but it would be a gesture strikingly out of character for a president who has so often sought to inflame passions.

Democrats are concerned that an array of steps traditionally involved in a presidential transition could be ignored or disrupted by Trump administration officials. But the initial stages of the transition have begun without any disruptions.

A top White House adviser, Chris Liddell, has been leading transition planning for the Trump administration, but Mr. Trump has not been involved, one White House official said, in part because of his superstitions about planning before an election, and in part because officials feared he would try to meddle with them.

As Mr. Trump’s motorcade arrived back at the White House Saturday afternoon, passing crowds of Biden supporters applauding the president’s ouster, Mr. Trump’s aides were still in varying degrees of shock about the outcome of a race that many had believed he would win.

Some of those aides had already started to leave in anticipation of a loss. Ja’Ron Smith, the most senior Black official in the West Wing and a deputy assistant to the president, sent an email to colleagues on Friday saying that he was departing. One of his colleagues said it had been long planned, but others saw it as the beginning of a slow exodus as Inauguration Day draws closer.

Mr. Trump, for his part, showed no sign of ending his hunt for allegations of fraud that could lend credence to lawsuits he wants filed in a number of states. A campaign official said that Mr. Stepien and Mr. Kushner had David Bossie, the head of the conservative group Citizens United and a longtime Trump ally, to lead efforts to contest vote counts in several states.

Some of the president’s allies in the Senate said they understood why he felt entrenched.

“I don’t blame him one bit for fighting for every single vote,” said Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota.

Some of the president’s campaign donors disagreed. “President Trump should go against his nature and call off the legal dogs,” said Dan Eberhart, a Trump supporter and donor, who called Mr. Biden’s victory “unfortunate.”

But even before he leaves the White House, one of Mr. Trump’s most powerful forms of communication has been diminished. Twitter has grown increasingly aggressive about flagging the president’s false statements about “illegal ballots” and demands that local state election officials stop counting ballots prematurely.

A spokesman for Twitter, Nick Pacilio, said in a statement that the company had flagged the president’s tweets “for making potentially misleading claims about an election.”

“This action is in line with our civic integrity policy,” the statement continued, “and as is standard with this warning, we will significantly restrict engagements on these tweets.”"
Biden Knows Washington Has Changed. He’s Less Sure He Has To.,"

Joseph R. Biden Jr., distinguished backslapper and inveterate deal-seeker, has spent most of his last 50 years in the middle of things.

As a presidential candidate, he urged moderation, suggesting that the country was not as progressive as some Democratic rivals insisted.

As vice president, he was the White House emissary dispatched to negotiate with unbending Republicans in Congress, at times with too little success and too willing capitulation in the eyes of liberals.

And across his decades in the Senate, Mr. Biden tended to find his way to the center of the fray — civil rights debates, judicial hearings, the crime bill, the Iraq war — priding himself on a reputation as the lawmaker most likely to befriend Ted Kennedy and Strom Thurmond in the same lifetime.

“For the man who will see, time heals,” Mr. Biden said in a generous 2003 eulogy for Mr. Thurmond, the avowed South Carolina segregationist whom he saluted for moving to “the good side” eventually. “Time changes.”

Now, as Mr. Biden prepares to assume the presidency in a divided Washington, he will confront the ultimate test of how much times have changed, and how much he has. While Democrats have retained hope that two runoff elections in Georgia might deliver them narrow control of the Senate after all, Biden allies are bracing for the prospect that Republicans will rule the chamber.

Even an optimistic scenario for him — a 50-50 Senate with Kamala Harris supplying tiebreaking votes as vice president — would place a Biden administration at the mercy of the most centrist Democrats, like Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia.

As a matter of policymaking, this is plainly a significant disappointment for the Biden team, instantly complicating the legislative path for priorities like health care and climate action and raising the chances that even cabinet confirmations will require serious Republican cooperation.

At the same time, it would be difficult to conjure a more consequential proving ground for the arguments Mr. Biden has made throughout his career: that compromise is good, that modest progress is still progress and that he is the man to help make it happen.

“The refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not some mysterious force beyond our control,” he said in his victory speech from Wilmington, Del., on Saturday night. “It’s a decision, a choice we make. And if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate.”

Friends say the election results seem likely to reinforce Mr. Biden’s belief in his own style, if only because he sees no other course available. He recognizes that the world has changed, they suggest; he is just less convinced that his worldview should.

The realities of a Republican-led Senate might even lend Mr. Biden some cover with the left, delaying or at least dulling thorny intraparty tussles over contentious progressive proposals like Supreme Court expansion.

“He won’t be so captive to a certain element in his own party,” said Chuck Hagel, who worked with Mr. Biden as Barack Obama’s defense secretary and as a Republican senator from Nebraska. “In a way I think that strengthens his hand for his style of governing and how he approaches governing. There’s no other option. He’s got to reach out and work with both parties.”

Some younger Democrats have accused Mr. Biden of clinging to a bygone — and, they say, forever-gone — vision of collaborative government.

This was a week, after all, during which some Republican lawmakers indulged or even wholly embraced President Trump’s baseless, dangerous claims of wide-scale election fraud.

“Joe Biden will have defeated Donald Trump by millions of votes in a resounding victory,” said Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for Justice Democrats, a group that helped elect Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other progressives to Congress. “And meanwhile, the Republican Party’s leadership is on television delegitimizing the next four years.”

Mr. Shahid urged Mr. Biden not to treat Republicans as good-faith governing partners. “We are just in a very different time now,” he said.

But Mr. Biden has long held himself out as a figure with uncommon powers of persuasion, one determined to see the good in people and unencumbered by rigid ideology.

He has often told audiences of advice he says he received early in his career from Mike Mansfield, the longtime Senate majority leader: “It’s always appropriate to question another man’s judgment,” Mr. Biden recalled him saying, in a 2015 address, “but never appropriate to question his motives because you simply don’t know his motives.”

The trouble for Mr. Biden now is that Republican motives and incentives will almost certainly run counter to his much of the time. When Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, last faced a Democratic White House — the one in which Mr. Biden served — he said explicitly that his goal was to make Mr. Obama a one-term president.

While Mr. Biden maintained a far more cordial relationship with Mr. McConnell in those years and has said he would work with the Republican “where we can agree,” he often strained in his 2020 bid to land on a compelling explanation for why a Biden administration would succeed in fostering bipartisanship where an Obama administration could not.

His point often seemed to be that he had to try anyway. “We don’t talk to each other anymore,” Mr. Biden lamented last year, earning a scolding from some Democrats after warmly invoking the “civility” that defined his relationships with segregationist peers early in his Senate life.

But then, this has always been the question for Mr. Biden in this campaign: Is he a man for this Washington moment or an old one? Is he too fixated on the latter to understand the former?

The voters, at least, saw fit to find out.

In interviews, former colleagues seemed split on Mr. Biden’s capacity to transcend today’s pervasive partisanship, with some doubtful that the Republican posture would change much even with Mr. Trump out of office.

“I don’t think it’s transferable,” former Senator Bob Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat who served with Mr. Biden through the 1990s, said of the chamber’s productive tenor in that age. “He was there for eight years under Obama. He knows that the Republicans can be very, very obstructionist if they want to be.”

Still, Mr. Kerrey added, maybe it was useful to be “a little naïve” and make bipartisan overtures regardless, in part to “get public opinion on his side for his big initiatives.”

Carol Moseley Braun, a former Democratic senator from Illinois, said that much of Mr. Biden’s expertise in Washington power and procedure remained relevant.

“He knows the levers of government better than anybody,” she said. She recalled his help in gaming out Senate dynamics in 1993, when she was a freshman senator seeking to block a request to grant the United Daughters of the Confederacy a renewed patent on an emblem with the Confederate battle flag.

Of course, some snapshots of compromise and collegiality from Mr. Biden’s career around that time have aged poorly with Democrats. Among other reconsiderations, he has expressed regret for the Judiciary Committee’s treatment of Anita Hill at the 1991 confirmation hearings for Justice Clarence Thomas, when many liberals say Mr. Biden, the committee chairman, was too deferential to Senate Republicans who subjected Ms. Hill to demeaning and invasive questioning.

More relevant to Mr. Biden’s present mind-set, those who know him say, are the Obama years. Their two terms were hamstrung by opposition from Tea Party Republicans who directed their fury at the nation’s first Black president and showed little interest in working with him. None of it caused Mr. Biden to abandon his instinct for consensus-building, whether or not such an aim was always possible.

“It tested his faith in that kind of thinking,” said Matt Teper, a top speechwriter for Mr. Biden at the time. “But it never manifested itself in any kind of frothy animosity.”

Several supporters cited Mr. Biden’s pledge this past week to be a president “for all Americans,” the sort of generically hopeful message they say the times demand.

In remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said that once the election passed, the hour would finally come “to unite, to heal, to come together as a nation.”

“This won’t be easy,” he said. “I’m not naïve.”

No one has challenged the first part."
Treasury Secretary Warren? Progressives Line Up to Press Their Agenda on Biden,"They have an extensive blacklist for possible Biden appointees they do not like. They want to elevate allies like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to premier government posts. And they are even considering the possibility of bypassing Senate approval to fill executive branch roles. 

As progressives have watched the Senate potentially slip out of reach this week, they have begun preparing to unleash a furious campaign to pressure President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. over personnel and priorities — even as they wrestle with the results of the election and the possible need to be more realistic about expectations over the next two years.

“For those of us who focus on governance and economic and social justice, this election is a dismal rubber stamp of the unacceptable status quo,” said Larry Cohen, the chairman of Our Revolution, a progressive group. “Black, brown and white working Americans see their hopes of real reform evaporate for now, even while cheering the victory over Trump.”

The left is now pinning its hopes on the Democrats winning two Senate runoff elections in Georgia in January. Progressive groups including the Sunrise Movement, an organization of young climate activists, are already drawing up plans to mobilize their networks and provide organizing muscle to the Democratic campaigns there.

But as election results have trickled in, excitement in progressive circles for their federal agenda has given way to disappointment and even anger. Despite the surging energy on the left, a moderate is poised to sit in the White House. And unless Democrats can pick up both Georgia seats, Republicans will almost certainly hold the Senate, which may drastically limit what a Biden administration can accomplish in terms of legislation, presidential appointments and judicial nominations.

Far from the mandate they had sought, progressives are now trying to figure out whether they can achieve even their less ambitious policy goals.

“Everything’s harder with a Republican Senate,” said Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, the co-chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. “There’s just no question about that.”

Since the polls closed last week, frustration on the left has at times spilled into the open. Some progressives have second-guessed the Democratic establishment’s messaging strategy and its approach to Senate races, which revolved around backing moderate candidates who officials thought could appeal to independents and Republicans disaffected with President Trump. And there has been public questioning of Democratic efforts to court Latino voters after Mr. Biden’s losses in Texas and Florida.

“I need my colleagues to understand that we are not the enemy,” said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a leading progressive, in an interview with The Times. “And that their base is not the enemy. That the Movement for Black Lives is not the enemy, that Medicare for all is not the enemy. This isn’t even just about winning an argument. It’s that if they keep going after the wrong thing, I mean, they’re just setting up their own obsolescence.”

Since the race in Pennsylvania was called for Mr. Biden on Saturday, clinching the election, some groups have already warned him about backsliding on his commitment to progressive policies.

Still, most liberals recognized that Mr. Biden was almost certain not to support all of their priorities or accept all of their proposals, regardless of the outcome in the Senate. They were, for instance, under no illusion that he would appoint progressives to every cabinet position or pass policies like “Medicare for all.”

Yet their more downbeat mood is a drastic shift from just days ago. Buoyed by a new class of progressives heading to the House of Representatives — including Jamaal Bowman, in a New York district that includes parts of the Bronx and Westchester County, and Cori Bush in St. Louis — the party’s left flank was planning a three-pronged strategy to push Mr. Biden, should he win, on personnel, legislation and institutional change.

They were envisioning a wide-ranging legislative agenda that included plans to expand access to health care, create jobs and combat climate change. They also dreamed of structural changes to the political system such as statehood for Washington, D.C., eliminating the legislative filibuster and increasing the number of justices on the Supreme Court.

Many had been cautiously optimistic that Mr. Biden’s administration would at least be receptive to their proposals, pointing in particular to his leftward shift since the primaries on issues like climate, health care and education. Progressives also believed that the coronavirus crisis made Mr. Biden more inclined to consider a broad agenda that responds to the extraordinary circumstances.

But as they adjust to the possible new reality of divided government, many progressive groups and leaders are focusing their attention on Mr. Biden’s executive branch appointments with intense urgency, viewing these positions as gatekeepers, in effect, for vast numbers of policy.

In recent weeks, they have called on Mr. Biden not to appoint any corporate lobbyists or c-suite corporate executives to executive branch positions. A group called the Revolving Door Project is already drawing up a “blacklist” of possible Biden appointments that progressives may view as problematic.

“We want appointees who will wake up trying to figure out, What can I do to make this government work for people?” said Jeff Hauser, the executive director of the Revolving Door Project. “There are allies who focus more on who they do want. We focus on who we don’t want.”

Some on the left, including Mr. Hauser, have already expressed opposition to two of Mr. Biden’s potential choices for Treasury secretary: Lael Brainard, a Federal Reserve governor, in part for her record on trade and currency manipulation in China; and Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island, a former venture capitalist, whose overhaul of her state’s public pension system made her deeply unpopular with some labor unions.

Instead, many liberals are pushing Mr. Biden both in private and public to name Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to the position — a post that Ms. Warren herself wants, according to a person familiar with her thinking (a spokeswoman for Ms. Warren declined to comment). Others on the progressives’ shortlist for the position include Sarah Bloom Raskin, who served as deputy secretary of the Treasury under President Barack Obama, and Janet Yellen, the former chair of the Federal Reserve.

Mr. Sanders is interested in serving as labor secretary, according to a person close to the senator, and his camp and Mr. Biden’s team have seriously been discussing the possibility since the Vermont senator dropped out of the presidential race in April. There is no deal between the camps, and it is still unclear what role Mr. Sanders may want to play in a Biden administration.

Appointing progressive senators like Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders to his cabinet could complicate things for Mr. Biden because both come from states led by Republican governors; Democrats would want to make sure that any replacements would caucus with the Democrats to keep the balance of the Senate intact.

Mr. Sanders’s operation has also offered the Biden transition team lists of preferred names for cabinet positions and prominent jobs in the administration, including Keith Ellison, the Minnesota attorney general, for U.S. attorney general and Julián Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio, for housing secretary, a position he held in the Obama administration.

Other measures are in the works as well. The Sunrise Movement is planning to push Mr. Biden to form a new position, reporting directly to the president, that will be responsible for coordinating and mobilizing government agencies to address climate change.

Progressives are also compiling extensive lists of recommendations for a vast array of other key posts. The Progressive Change Institute, in collaboration with roughly 40 public interest, environmental and racial justice groups, has been assembling an extensive database of personnel who could stock a potential Democratic administration.

The database, which now has from 500 to 600 names, covers everything from cabinet positions to under secretary posts in more obscure executive-branch offices and bureaus, like the president of the Export-Import Bank and the director of the Patent and Trademark Office. The group hopes to deliver the list to the Biden transition team by the end of the week.

Progressives recognize that their work on appointments and policy may be much harder if there is a Republican Senate, as appears increasingly likely. It may not confirm appointments to key government posts whom Republicans view as too far left, a course of action that Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has already suggested he would pursue.

And without enough Democratic allies in the Senate, there is almost no chance that the chamber will pass even the agenda that Mr. Biden supported in the run-up to the election, such as lowering the eligibility age for Medicare to 60 from 65.

“If Mitch McConnell was ultimately to control the Senate, it would dramatically lower the ceiling of what’s possible legislatively and increase the urgency of appointing good people to the executive branch to make things happen there,” said Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a sister organization of the Progressive Change Institute, and an ally of Ms. Warren’s.

Progressives have not abandoned hope of passing legislation, either, even if a Republican Senate makes doing so much more difficult. They are optimistic that there is broadly palatable legislation that the Senate may still pass, including a coronavirus relief bill, a $15 federal minimum wage and investment in infrastructure.

“I believe that if Joe Biden is in the White House, it changes the dynamic where people know that there will be a president who will sign these things into law,” Ms. Jayapal said. “And that will help us a lot.”

“That’s the question: Are Republicans going to continue to be enablers of an outrageous Trump agenda even when he’s out of the White House?” she added. “Or are they actually going to start speaking for their constituents?”

But if election results have dashed progressive hopes on some issues, there is still a sense of resolve.

Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for the insurgent liberal group Justice Democrats, said it was “critical” for Democrats and Mr. Biden to govern like they just won a majority of the popular vote rather than seeking to appease Mr. McConnell and other Republicans. He warned that going after “small-ball deals” with Mr. McConnell could depress Democratic enthusiasm in the 2022 midterm elections. And he noted that Mr. Trump had appointed several people on an acting basis to positions that traditionally required Senate confirmation.

“Basically, Joe Biden should use every tool at his disposal to appoint an administration that will deliver for the voters who elected him,” he said. “There’s going to be a lot of efforts to push on the executive and what the executive can do.”"
"After Warnings It Could Go Off the Rails, the Election Actually Ran Smoothly","In Georgia, a high school senior organized her classmates to be poll workers so voters would not have to wait hours in line like they did back in June.

In Wisconsin, Milwaukee officials leased the whole floor of a downtown office building to serve as the headquarters to count a record number of absentee ballots.

And in Michigan, the secretary of state organized three shifts of more than 700 people each in Detroit who counted twice as many ballots as they had for the August primary in just over half as much time.

Even as the nation waited for the call designating the winner — Joseph R. Biden Jr. was declared the victor on Saturday morning — it had reason to breathe a sigh of relief. Despite warnings of violence, threats of foreign interference, rampant disinformation, cuts to the Postal Service, President Trump’s sowing of distrust and a pandemic that forced the relocation of thousands of polling places, the machinery of American democracy adapted and held up this past week.

The result was a relatively smooth election free of the hourslong lines and vote-suppressing shenanigans that have characterized the voting experience in recent years, particularly during the primaries of the coronavirus era.

The performance was the result of months and, in some cases, years of planning for a transition from Election Day voting to expanded absentee and early in-person balloting. It involved elections administrators at all levels of state and local government and tens of thousands of new poll workers, lured to perform a civic duty that had never before required taking a personal health risk to allow their fellow citizens to exercise their right to vote.

“There was never a moment when I didn’t think it was going to work because I believe in the American people,” said Adrian Fontes, the top elections administrator in Maricopa County, Ariz., which includes Phoenix and 60 percent of the state’s voters. “We are a raucous, dysfunctional family who will stand together in the best of times and in the worst of times. If you can’t believe that then you have no business running American elections.”

For months heading into November, there was a growing and influential crowd of American doomsayers warning of one calamity after another that could befall the election. Now that the voting is over and took place without a catastrophic structural failure, a crippling cyberattack from abroad or extralegal interference from the Trump administration, those who spent the summer and fall sounding alarms said that without their warnings the worst-case scenarios might have come to pass.

Rosa Brooks, a Georgetown University law professor who convened a group to brainstorm ways the Trump administration could disrupt the election, said the warnings prompted more planning from the news media and local government agencies.

And with the counting, recounting and legal challenges still underway, Ms. Brooks said the country’s deep divisions and easy access to disinformation meant the threat of political violence remained high.

“This is like in Harry Potter where in Book 3 everybody thinks Voldemort is dead but he’s not,” she said. “Nobody should prematurely think we can relax and stop worrying about right-wing extremism.”

Delays in counting some mailed-in absentee ballots were expected in Arizona, Pennsylvania, New York and California, which as of Saturday morning still had 3.6 million of its 16.9 million ballots cast left to be counted — and ballots arriving until Nov. 20 can be counted in California as long as they were postmarked by Election Day.

Boards of election in New York City and its Long Island suburbs have not even begun to count hundreds of thousands of absentee ballots, a process that delayed the results of its June primary for weeks as officials struggled to adapt to elections altered by the coronavirus.

At the heart of the election was an army of poll workers, hundreds of thousands of Americans who agreed to work very long hours doing rather tedious jobs at modest pay to ensure their neighbors could vote.

More than 700,000 people signed up to work at polling sites through Power the Polls, an umbrella group of dozens of local and national civic organizations and corporations that connected workers to local elections administrators.

Mallory Rogers, a 17-year-old high school senior in Rome, Ga., worked a 13-hour shift as a poll worker during Georgia’s dysfunctional June primary — after receiving no training for how to operate the state’s new voting equipment.

“I showed up and I didn’t know what I was doing,” she said.

When her school year began, Ms. Rogers, who also worked a 15-hour shift for Georgia’s primary runoff in August, started a club at Rome High School to recruit friends to serve as poll workers. About a dozen other students signed up, which, along with other new poll workers, helped double the number of people working the polls in Floyd County.

On Monday, Ms. Rogers and her friends went to set up the polling sites and found campaign signs within 150 feet of the entrance — a no-no under Georgia law. But a woman who spotted them removing the signs did not believe the teenagers were poll workers and called the police.

“We got pulled over by five sheriffs and they didn’t believe us either,” Ms. Rogers said. “It was four high schoolers in the car with five cop cars behind us. That was a terrifying experience.”

Ms. Rogers’s job on Election Day was to scan voters’ identification cards and log them in before directing them to voting machines. Lines were longest in the morning, but nobody waited more than 30 minutes, she said.

For Ms. Rogers, Georgia’s two Senate races requiring January runoffs was the best possible outcome. She had assumed her club would have to disband after the election, but now it will continue, aiming to recruit more poll workers and in the meantime registering voters before the state’s Dec. 7 deadline.

“I will definitely be working,” she said.

With much of the voting shifting to absentee ballots, concerns about running a fair election spiked over the summer after a Trump megadonor, Louis DeJoy, was installed to run the Postal Service and ordered operational changes that led delivery rates to drop sharply.

But a series of court orders from judges across the country in response to a dozen lawsuits filed against the Postal Service forced Mr. DeJoy to reverse his changes, such as limiting overtime and demanding mail trucks run at certain times. Over the last week, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., ordered sweeps of postal facilities to find any ballots that had yet to be delivered and expedite them.

In the end, the Postal Service delivered more than 60 million ballots, with likely only hundreds or a few thousand arriving after election deadlines, according to data filed in federal court and lawyers who have been monitoring the agency’s performance. While there were recriminations over disenfranchising even a single voter, there was no systemic breakdown.

“There were no reports in Colorado of any type of slow down,” said Jena Griswold, the secretary of state in Colorado, which mailed ballots to every registered voter. 

All those ballots that arrived in the mail and in drop boxes brought new stresses on election administrators.

Some of the bleakest scenes of voting during the pandemic had come earlier in the year in Milwaukee, which for the state’s April presidential primary reduced its number of polling places from 180 to five because the city could not assure poll workers they would be safe. Voters waited for hours in the rain to vote. 

By November, Milwaukee had trained 3,300 new poll workers — up from 200 available in April, and had 600 dedicated to counting the 169,000 absentee ballots. The city spent $250,000 on plexiglass partitions at the 175 polling places it opened for its November general election. And unlike in April, everyone who signed up to work the polls in November showed up.

Instead of the hourslong lines in April, the enduring image of Milwaukee’s general election was Claire Woodall-Vogg, the executive director of Milwaukee’s election commission, getting a police escort at 4 a.m. on Wednesday for the five-block journey to hand-deliver the results to the Milwaukee County Courthouse.

Even that, Ms. Woodall-Vogg said, was a pretty normal experience.

“In previous elections, the police followed me in my car,” she said. “This time it was a matter of how am I going to get there efficiently with a media barrage. It wasn’t out of the ordinary.”

In Michigan, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson recruited more than 30,000 election workers to staff the polls and, in Detroit, work around the clock counting the state’s three million absentee ballots.

In Detroit, that meant building three teams of 700 to 800 people each who would begin counting ballots when the polls opened on Election Day and work continuously until the job was finished midday Wednesday. In the August primary, with half as many absentee ballots cast, it took Michigan officials two full days after the election to finish counting, Ms. Benson said.

Among the new poll workers was Crystal Reed, a 52-year-old from Warren, Mich.

Ms. Reed, who works for the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, arrived at an elementary school at 5:20 a.m. to begin setting up for the polls opening at 7. She then spent all day working the tabulator, helping people insert their ballot into a machine to be counted before making sure they left with the ubiquitous “I Voted” sticker.

She stayed until 9 p.m., leaving upbeat about democracy and her place in it.

“I love to make people happy and to see the smiles on these people’s faces, it was really nice,” Ms. Reed said. “I think when you’re smiling and you’ve got that positive energy, it can bounce off of them and make them happy too.”

How Joe Biden Won the Presidency,"On a January evening in 2019, Joseph R. Biden Jr. placed a call to the mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, a personal friend and political ally who had just announced he would not pursue the Democratic nomination for president.

During their conversation, Mr. Garcetti recalled, Mr. Biden did not exactly say he had decided to mount his own campaign. The former vice president confided that if he did run, he expected President Trump to “come after my family” in an “ugly” election.

But Mr. Biden also said he felt pulled by a sense of moral duty.

“He said, back then, ‘I really am concerned about the soul of this country,’” Mr. Garcetti said.

Twenty-one months and a week later, Mr. Biden stands triumphant in a campaign he waged on just those terms: as a patriotic crusade to reclaim the American government from a president he considered a poisonous figure. The language he used in that call with Mr. Garcetti became the watchwords of a candidacy designed to marshal a broad coalition of voters against Mr. Trump and his reactionary politics. 

It was not the most inspirational campaign in recent times, nor the most daring, nor the most agile. His candidacy did not stir an Obama-like youth movement or a Trump-like cult of personality: There were no prominent reports of Biden supporters branding themselves with “Joe” tattoos and lionizing him in florid murals — or even holding boat parades in his honor. Mr. Biden campaigned as a sober and conventional presence, rather than as an uplifting herald of change. For much of the general election, his candidacy was not an exercise in vigorous creativity, but rather a case study in discipline and restraint.

In the end, voters did what Mr. Biden asked of them and not much more: They repudiated Mr. Trump, while offering few other rewards to Mr. Biden’s party. And by a popular vote margin of four million and counting, Americans made Mr. Biden only the third man since the Second World War to topple a duly elected president after just one term.

Throughout his campaign, Mr. Biden faced persistent doubts about his political acuity and the relevance, in the year 2020, of a set of union-hall-meets-cloakroom political instincts developed mainly in the previous century. 

But if Mr. Biden made numerous errors along the way, none of them mattered more in this election than the essential rightness of how he judged the character of his party, his country and his opponent. This account of his candidacy, based on interviews with four dozen advisers, supporters, elected officials and friends, reveals how fully Mr. Biden’s campaign flowed from his own worldview and political intuition.

During the primaries, Mr. Biden rebuffed pressure to move to the left, believing his party would embrace his pragmatism as its best chance to beat Mr. Trump. In the general election, Mr. Biden made Mr. Trump’s erratic conduct and mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic his overwhelming themes, shunning countless other issues as needless distractions.

While some Democrats urged him to compete in a wider array of battlegrounds, Mr. Biden put the Great Lakes states at the center of his electoral map, trusting that with an appeal to the political middle he could rebuild the so-called Blue Wall and block Mr. Trump’s path to a second term.

Perhaps most importantly, Mr. Biden believed that no issue would figure larger in voters’ minds than Mr. Trump’s presence in the Oval Office. And if he could make the election an up-or-down vote on an out-of-control president, he believed he could win.

On that score, he was right. As voters sized up Mr. Biden as a potential president, his familiar flaws and foibles — the antiquated vocabulary and penchant for embellishment, his nostalgic yarns about segregationist senators and a defensiveness that led him, in one case, to challenge a voter to a push-up contest — paled against the conduct of an incumbent sowing racial division, threatening to deploy troops in American cities and floating the idea of injecting disinfectant as a coronavirus treatment.

Anita Dunn, one of Mr. Biden’s closest advisers, said the campaign had been propelled all along by the candidate himself, and his unwavering theme and strategy.

“It was his campaign,” Ms. Dunn said. “It was less consultant-driven than any presidential campaign in modern history.”

Still, at the outset, Mr. Biden’s political theory of the case struck even some of his loyal allies as misguided in an era of intense ideological polarization.

Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania recalled a meeting he had with the former vice president in March of 2019, shortly before Mr. Biden entered the race. As Mr. Biden sketched out his approach, Mr. Casey, a Democrat, was not fully convinced.

“He was walking through what became his broader-based theme, about the soul of the country,” Mr. Casey said. “I was worried at the time that it wasn’t hard-hitting enough.”

But Mr. Biden, he said, “was prescient in his ability, even in the primaries when almost nobody else was doing it, to say, ‘We have to bring the country back together.’”

Mr. Casey was not the only Democrat skeptical of Mr. Biden’s underlying theme. While many voters found Mr. Trump distasteful, or worse, it is difficult to unseat an incumbent president and Mr. Trump had the benefit of a nation in relative peace and steady prosperity. Mr. Biden’s primary opponents, who argued that a message of normalcy and steady experience might not be enough to win, seemed to have a point.

Then, just as Mr. Biden was seizing a clear upper hand in the Democratic nomination fight, the coronavirus pandemic struck. In a matter of days, public campaigning froze and a mood of fear and gloom set in across the country.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, a close ally of Mr. Biden, said it was not immediately obvious that the Trump administration would effectively forfeit the issue of public health to Mr. Biden. The White House, Ms. Whitmer said, “really could have risen to the occasion.”

But as Mr. Trump dismissed the threat of the pandemic, and railed against governors like Ms. Whitmer for locking down their states, Mr. Biden moved to assert himself as an alternative leader. He began to sketch his own approach to addressing the disease, and to show voters how he might operate in Mr. Trump’s place.

From the confines of his lakeside home in Wilmington, Del., he received frequent briefings about the pandemic and the economic damage it was inflicting, drafted policy plans and reached out to state and city leaders to gather information.

“He was calling to say, ‘How are things going in Michigan? What do you need?’” Ms. Whitmer said.

What Mr. Biden was not doing, to the dismay of some in his party, was traveling the country and campaigning in person. For months, he scarcely left the immediate vicinity of his home: At 77, he was in an age group especially vulnerable to the virus, and his advisers felt he could undermine his own public-health recommendations if he was seen as racing back onto the campaign trail. And more than a few political donors and Democratic advocacy groups second-guessed the Biden campaign’s decision to forgo a robust get-out-the-vote operation in the field because of safety concerns.

Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League, said Mr. Biden had seemed at first to pay a price for his caution. Allies of the Biden campaign had tried to nudge the former vice president into public view, he said, paraphrasing the plea: “People need to see you.”

But in his own conversations with the Biden team, Mr. Morial said, they were emphatic that Mr. Biden felt he could not “say one thing and do another” where public health was concerned — a judgment that Mr. Morial came to share.

Mr. Biden’s first major trip outside Delaware was not for a traditional campaign trip but to confront another crisis: the national reckoning over police brutality after the killing of George Floyd. Flying to Houston to visit the Floyd family, Mr. Biden sat for two hours as he listened to the grieving family and told them that while he had never experienced loss quite like theirs, he knew what it meant to lose a child and felt their pain, according to the Rev. Al Sharpton, who was present. When racial-justice protests turned disorderly in Atlanta, Mr. Biden reached out to the city’s mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, to offer support and private counsel. The former vice president, Ms. Bottoms said, was both encouraging and contemplative, telling her how the spiraling demonstrations evoked, for him, the riots in Wilmington in the late 1960s, which led to an extended occupation of the city by the National Guard.

It was a study in the personal empathy, and the hunger to connect with other people, that defined Mr. Biden as a candidate from the start. Throughout the race he invoked his own family’s history of tragedy, and never more so than in confronting the immense pain and loss of the coronavirus pandemic.

“He is able to personalize these big issues,” Ms. Bottoms said. “He really does have a sensitivity and a personal lens for many of these challenges that we’re facing.”

Mr. Biden also recognized that his opponent lacked that impulse.

While Democrats worried that Mr. Biden was taking an overly passive approach to the race, Mr. Trump seemed almost to go out of his way to reinforce the appeal of his challenger’s prudence: There was Mr. Trump’s tear gas-shrouded photo op in Lafayette Park, intended as a show of strength, that came off instead as pure brutishness. There was his indoor rally in Tulsa, Okla., planned as an energetic return to the campaign trail, that instead became a low-energy coronavirus risk zone.

Still, as the country’s mood of emergency deepened, Mr. Biden confided to allies that he was already feeling the weight of the challenges that would lie ahead if he won.

Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois said she told Mr. Biden in a conversation earlier this year that the political moment seemed to cry out for a candidate with formidable governing experience. According to Ms. Duckworth’s recollection, Mr. Biden responded, “Tammy, I need people around me that understand that, and that we need to hit the ground running.”

Mr. Biden reacted in a similar fashion last Monday in Cleveland, when Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio told Mr. Biden he would soon have the chance to be “one of the great presidents of my lifetime.”

“He grabbed my shoulder,” Mr. Brown said, “pulled me in as much as you can when you’re wearing a mask and said: ‘I really need you to help me.’”

Mr. Biden also expressed pointed anxiety after delivering a pair of speeches about national unity and healing at Gettysburg, Pa., and Warm Springs, Ga. — two landmarks associated with the crisis presidencies of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt.

If Mr. Biden found those backdrops politically resonant, he suggested to an adviser that he was less comfortable with the implied comparison between himself and those men. Mr. Biden had a difficult time, he said, seeing himself as the next Lincoln or Roosevelt.

The pandemic alone might not have shifted the political landscape in Mr. Biden’s favor had he not managed a feat the previous Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, could not: persuading Democrats to lock arms with him after a bruising primary.

Mr. Biden, however, had advantages that Mrs. Clinton did not, starting with a genial relationship with his chief opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

As the Democratic contest neared its end, Mr. Biden quickly took steps to accommodate his former rivals on the left. Days after Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts ended her campaign in early March, Mr. Biden called to tell her he was adopting one of her key proposals on bankruptcy reform. And when Mr. Sanders withdrew from the race, Mr. Biden agreed to create a set of policy task forces to formulate a shared governing agenda.

Representative Kathy Castor of Florida, a Democrat who sat on Mr. Biden’s climate task force, said the difference from 2016 was stark: “That was just so divisive back then, from the Democratic convention in Philadelphia through the election,” she said. “You can’t have Democrats fighting Democrats.”

But Mr. Biden did not budge on the overall ideological thrust of his campaign. On the contrary, he and his close advisers felt vindicated in their assessment of the Democratic Party as a center-left coalition, rather than one of the activist left. Though he added a handful of progressive policy hands to his campaign staff, Mr. Biden’s inner circle was dominated by relative centrists for whom the Sanders ethos of democratic socialism held little appeal.

Perhaps most prominent among those advisers was Valerie Biden Owens, Mr. Biden’s sister and longtime counselor, who stressed during internal deliberations that the campaign should be careful about attacking the wealthy as a political tactic. After all, Ms. Owens argued, many working-class people aspire to be rich.

“The Democratic Party is not what people may think it is on Twitter,” said Representative Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, a Biden supporter from day one who recalled telling the former vice president as much last year. “It’s still working-class African-Americans, whites and Latinos. And he was always true to that.”

Over the summer, Mr. Biden chose a running mate who he hoped would reconcile the competing pressures on his candidacy: to excite his own party without creating new vulnerabilities that Republicans might be able to exploit. He settled on Senator Kamala Harris of California, completing his ticket with a choice that was at once groundbreaking and cautious — a younger woman of color who largely shared his own pragmatic political instincts.

He wound up with a message and policy agenda that left Mr. Trump with only limited avenues for attack, and benefited from the president’s lack of interest in learning details. When Mr. Trump sensed vulnerabilities in the Democratic platform, he never devised a critique deeper than one-liner jibes seemingly made for Fox News: His attacks on Mr. Biden’s climate plans, for instance, included claims that Democrats would force buildings to have tiny windows.

If Mr. Biden’s approach held up throughout the campaign, it left enormous unanswered questions for him to confront later on. In some cases, Mr. Biden and his advisers deliberately opted to suppress rather than resolve Democratic disagreements until after the election.

The most prominent example was Mr. Biden’s evasive response to Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s elevation to the Supreme Court. As other Democrats raised a cry of support for overhauling the federal judiciary, Mr. Biden spent weeks refusing to state his own position, eventually proposing a commission to study judicial reforms as a temporary salve.

The rush to seat Justice Barrett opened his eyes more to the hardball tactics of today’s Senate Republicans, said one adviser. But in private, Mr. Biden has continued to express unease about trying to expand the high court, and he is still more intrigued by broader judicial reforms than simply adding justices.

One lawmaker said Steve Ricchetti, a former chief of staff to Mr. Biden, had been candid last summer about the campaign’s dilatory approach to the party’s internal divisions. Asked privately how Mr. Biden intended to handle the left, Mr. Ricchetti acknowledged that it would be a challenge over the long term.

For the moment, he said, getting through Nov. 3 was the only goal.

The most perilous moment of the race for Mr. Biden may have come in late August, when a season of racial-justice protests had given way to spasms of vandalism and arson in a handful of politically important states. In Wisconsin, after the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, by a police officer in Kenosha, rioting erupted in the suburban city — and Mr. Trump went on the attack.

At the Republican nominating convention, the president and his allies pounded Mr. Biden for a week with false or overstated attacks, linking him both to outright criminals and to left-wing activists who had taken up “defund the police” as a slogan. Mr. Biden had disavowed the idea, but Republicans persisted.

The onslaught posed a distinctive challenge to Mr. Biden, threatening to weaken his coalition of racial minorities, young liberals and moderate whites. Mr. Trump began a scare campaign aimed in part at white women, telling them he would “save your suburbs” from what he portrayed as looting mobs that Mr. Biden would not control.

Like other liberals of his generation, Mr. Biden saw danger in the Kenosha riots. Recalling the riots in American cities after the assassinations of the 1960s, he telephoned an adviser, saying he wanted to denounce the violence and asking a question: What had Robert F. Kennedy said to cool tempers in the aftermath of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s murder?

Mr. Biden flew to Pittsburgh the following Monday to head off Mr. Trump’s attacks: In a 24-minute speech, he reaffirmed his support for police reform while sternly denouncing civil unrest. “Looting,” he said, “is not protesting.”

“We need justice in America. We need safety in America,” Mr. Biden said.

The Biden campaign turned a clip from the speech into a television ad and ran it at saturation levels across the electoral map, countering Mr. Trump’s claims that a Democratic administration would unleash violent anarchy.

“Joe has always been someone who was able to hold two thoughts together at the same time about law enforcement and racial justice,” said Senator Chris Coons of Delaware.

And once again, Mr. Biden benefited from his opponent’s impulse toward incitement and division. At the very moment Democrats feared voters might see Mr. Trump as a fearless steward of public safety, the president also spoke out in defense of people sowing chaos on the right.

Mr. Trump would do so again in his first debate with Mr. Biden, marring his law-and-order message by declining to denounce an extremist group on the far right.

That moment after Kenosha was all the more important to Mr. Biden because of its resonance across the Midwest, the region he prized above all others. It was the band of states stretching from Minnesota across to Pennsylvania, Mr. Biden believed, that was likeliest to make him the next president.

His top lieutenants shared that assessment.

During a marathon Zoom session in May, after the campaign’s first major round of polling in the general election, Mr. Biden and his high command spent hours poring over the electoral map. By the end, they had hammered out their priorities: They would focus on three Great Lakes states Mr. Trump flipped in 2016 — Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania — plus Arizona, Florida and North Carolina. The campaign was skeptical of its chances in Florida and saw two other Sun Belt states, Georgia and Texas, as intriguing — but difficult and expensive to compete in.

When Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris returned to the campaign trail, that map guided their activities and their advertising strategy. They lunged at a few longer-shot targets, sending Ms. Harris on a last-minute trip to Texas, while Mr. Biden returned to Ohio, where polls showed him being competitive. Neither state wound up being close on election night.

More fruitful was an aggressive late play for Georgia, a rapidly diversifying state where suburban voters appeared to be swinging hard toward Democrats. In October, Mr. Biden’s pollster, John Anzalone, determined that the former vice president had a better chance to win there than in North Carolina and even Florida, and Mr. Biden embarked on his trip to Atlanta and Warm Springs. Ms. Harris visited the state repeatedly, and on the eve of the election the campaign decided to send former President Barack Obama to Georgia rather than North Carolina to make one last push there.

As the results began coming in on Tuesday, a tense mood took hold across much of the Biden campaign. In the first states to report, Florida and North Carolina, Mr. Trump was faring several points better than Democratic polling had forecast, and considerably ahead of most surveys conducted by the media.

The Biden campaign publicly projected composure, in contrast to Mr. Trump’s erratic behavior on Twitter and during late-night remarks from the East Room. Greg Schultz, Mr. Biden’s former campaign manager during the Democratic primaries, held a call with key supporters to offer reassurance, insisting that the early returns in the suburbs of Ohio were a good omen for the nearby swing states. But to some agitated listeners it was not a convincing presentation.

Mr. Biden’s inner circle grew increasingly unnerved as the night wore on and it became clear that the president was running stronger than expected. Jill Biden, former Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and an array of Biden advisers telephoned Democrats around the country to learn more about the vote count and whether Mr. Biden was in danger of losing.

Within a matter of hours, Mr. Biden’s fortunes had improved as the big cities of the North reported their votes. It would take until Saturday, when Pennsylvania was called in his favor, to confirm that Mr. Biden had won more than the 270 Electoral College votes required to claim the presidency. The Blue Wall was standing again for Democrats, and Mr. Biden could also prevail in the once-red states of Arizona and Georgia.

For all the Democratic jubilation at Mr. Trump’s demise, Mr. Biden may not entirely share that feeling of pure delight. Rahm Emanuel, who served as Mr. Obama’s chief of staff during the Great Recession, said he warned Mr. Biden recently that his reward for winning would be fleeting.

“You’re the dog that caught the car,” Mr. Emanuel said, alluding to what awaited Mr. Biden in the Oval Office.

The man who would soon be president-elect responded: “Ain’t that the truth.”"
"For a Trump Fan, a Week When Victory Ebbed Away","WILMINGTON, Mass. — Nick Rocco went into Election Day amped up. A 26-year-old hair stylist, he spent the past few months campaigning for President Trump, taking special satisfaction in offending Biden supporters.

It was still summer when he got kicked off his town’s community Facebook page for his pugnacious pro-Trump posts. When someone stole the Trump sign from his yard, he replaced it with half a dozen new ones, one featuring an expletive.

At his wedding last month, guests sauntered out in oversize Donald and Melania masks, and he savored the discomfort of his wife’s Democratic relatives.

“The thing is, we don’t care,” Mr. Rocco said. He is looking forward to many years of Trump presidencies. “I hope Don, Ivanka and Eric all run eventually,” he said last week.

Mr. Rocco represents a notable category: young voters drawn into politics for the first time by Mr. Trump. He did not go to college and prides himself on his independent thinking; he puts himself in the category of street smart, not book smart.

He had never bothered to register to vote until 2016, when he first heard Mr. Trump debate on television, and saw a political figure who reminded him of himself.

“He doesn’t speak like a politician, he speaks like I do,” he said. “I can understand what this guy is saying. He’s talking like an American person talks. He’s not talking like a robot.”

He and his wife, Jenna, a 27-year-old nurse, went all in, organizing rallies and standing on roadsides. As the election and vote counting neared an end, daily check-ins with the Roccos found their moods shifting from excitement to foreboding.

The family — Nick, Jenna and their two daughters — spent the afternoon at a rally beside Main Street in Wilmington, where passing motorists responded with honks and obscene gestures. Across the street, at a Trump pop-up store, a T-shirt cheerfully boasted, “I’m a deplorable.”

The abuse did not bother Mr. Rocco; it seemed to energize him. (“I like to be the center of attention,” he explained.) When a distraught woman with a curly ponytail flipped him off through her window, he bounded to the curb and danced a jig, cheerfully shouting obscenities back.

The Roccos had not paid much attention to the polls because they were convinced that Mr. Trump was going to win. This was based on attendance at rallies, and because of their circle of acquaintances: With the exception of his brother, Mr. Rocco said, he had never met anyone who supported Joseph R. Biden Jr.

When Fox News began reporting polls showing Mr. Biden in the lead, Ms. Rocco tried tuning into One America News, the right-wing cable network, which predicted a convincing victory for the president. The Roccos got news from a variety of sources — TikTok, QAnon, the pro-Trump comedian Terrence K. Williams, the YouTube mystic Clif High. “I’m a conspiracy theorist, I guess, if you want to call it that,” Ms. Rocco said.

These sources cheered them up. They held out hope that Mr. Trump could win in Massachusetts. Or at least in Wilmington. 

Ms. Rocco confessed that she was exhausted with the months of public confrontation. Mr. Rocco, she complains, sits on Facebook and argues with strangers for hours.

“I want him to win,” she said of the president. “But I want it to be over.”

She was worried that their in-your-face support for Mr. Trump, in a state so hostile to him, would end up hurting their daughters.

“I’m just tired of all the arguing that people are doing,” she said. “I wish sometimes Trump would just say — he doesn’t even have to mean it — that he would be the president for everybody. Just say those words.”

In the last hours of the campaign, Ms. Rocco’s confidence in Mr. Trump’s victory had begun to buckle. Late into the night, when he gave his final speech at a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., she was surprised to find herself weeping. “It was sad that it could be his last rally,” she said. “It could be that he could not be president anymore.”

At 7 on election night, the Roccos settled themselves on the sofa to watch the returns. Ms. Rocco was stress-eating Halloween candy, KitKats and Smarties.

They had passed the last hours of the campaign on a dark roadside outside a polling station, fingers frozen, waving Trump flags at passing vehicles. Mr. Rocco muttered to himself, “Me standing out here is kind of pointless.”

But then he reminded himself what kept him out there all these months: People had disrespected him. The Facebook group manager who had kicked him off. The neighbor who took his yard sign. Teachers who responded to his daughter’s enthusiasm about Mr. Trump with awkward silence.

“People who don’t like Trump, I honestly think they are very soft people,” he said. “That is why the world is becoming so sensitive today. Back in the day, you could throw a snowball at someone at school and everything was fine. Nowadays, a letter gets sent home: Your child is being mean.”

Mr. Trump, by contrast, “lives the way people used to live.”

Mr. Rocco has tried to do the same. His older brother, who he describes as the brainy one, took the other path, winning a scholarship to college. (He is the Biden voter.) But Mr. Rocco’s aspirations were staunchly blue-collar; he chose trade school and went to work at 17. 

When he won $1 million in the lottery in 2018 — his scratch-ticket hobby cost him $200 to $300 a day at its peak — he channeled his winnings, a lump sum of $650,000, into low-cost multifamily rental properties that he hopes will allow him to retire at 40.

The job market, he feels, has justified his choices, leaving many college graduates twisting in the wind.

“A plumber goes to my house, he fixes a clogged toilet, he makes $200,” he said. “The most paying jobs are the people who are fixing things. You’re going to school, and you’re paying $500,000 to go to school, and you might not be able to get a job.”

By 9:30 p.m., Massachusetts was a lost cause, but Mr. Trump seemed to have a commanding lead in Florida and Pennsylvania. The Roccos were run down, probably from the hours spent at rallies, and they drifted off around 11 p.m. with a warm, spreading certainty that their candidate was going to win.

It was sweet, and it felt like vindication.

At 2:30 in the morning, Ms. Rocco awoke with a start. When she checked her news feed, she discovered that Mr. Biden was leading in several Western states, and Mr. Trump’s advantage in states like Wisconsin and Michigan was melting away. Now she could no longer sleep.

“I’m about 100 percent sure there’s fraud going on,” she said, although there was no evidence of fraud.

When he woke up, Mr. Rocco shared her outrage. “Who knows whether these numbers are correct or not?” he asked. “Who are the people counting those votes?”

He wondered whether civil unrest would now break out. Over the summer, watching the Black Lives Matter protests, he had applied for a gun license, but he had been refused: Massachusetts, he grumbled.

When he saw the pro-Trump crowds gathering outside counting locations in Michigan and Arizona, he wished he could join them.

“It’s not ending,” he said. “I would love to see Trump supporters come out and take a stand.” 

By Thursday morning, the Roccos had given up on Fox. “There’s definitely people at Fox who don’t like Trump,” Mr. Rocco said. “The commentators, they are normally aggressive. I think they got a leash put on them somehow, some way.”

He took the position that the vote count should have ended on Nov. 3. He reassured his wife that the decision would finally lie in the hands of the Supreme Court.

“They’re doing anything they can to stop him from becoming president,” he said. “It’s not over yet. He’s going to win. It’s just a matter of who has the balls to close down first.”

But an alternative path was beginning to take shape in his mind, in case Mr. Biden prevailed. 

Maybe the Republicans could impeach Mr. Biden. Maybe a Republican Senate could tie his hands for four years. Maybe, after a long-planned Caribbean vacation, Mr. Rocco would fly out to Arizona and join the protesters. Maybe he would post new yard signs.

“Like I told you, I hate to lose,” he said. “If he loses, I’ll feel like I’ve lost.”

When Mr. Trump delivered remarks at the White House, Mr. Rocco was struck by his appearance. The president looked drained and serious, no longer a happy warrior. The message the president conveyed was grave: that American democracy is a farce.

“He’s been telling us about that for months, and I think it’s actually happening now,” he said. “How are we ever going to be able to vote for a president again, now that we know that fraud has been going on?”

The news on Friday morning was no surprise. Officials in states that had not been called had spent much of the night meticulously counting ballots, in the presence of observers from both parties. 

Mr. Biden was a hair’s breadth from the presidency, on course to win at least 270 electoral votes.

“Every time I went to bed, it was the same,” Mr. Rocco said. “I go to bed, he was winning, I wake up, he was losing.”

Ms. Rocco sounded resigned. “I think that basically it’s pretty much done,” she said. “But they cheated. But it’s done.”

The people she had spent the summer with, the Trump activists, she could see them packing it in, returning to normal life.

“They’re just going to want to move on,” she said. “My aunt’s already saying, ‘Stop being a crybaby.’”

Mr. Rocco was not ready to give up, though. The president would not concede, he was sure of that. “I’d be pissed at him if he did because I would never do that,” he said. “He’s not that type of person. He doesn’t give up easily. I see a lot of myself in him.”

Casting his mind into the future, past this election, he could imagine any number of outcomes.

He could imagine the United States splitting into two countries, one governed by Mr. Trump and one not. He could imagine suspending elections so Mr. Trump and his family could rule without interruption for 20 years.

“I guarantee you, Trump supporters would not care,” he said. “I guarantee you, if you got 69 million Trump supporters, and you said, ‘Would you be good with Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump as president?’ a lot of people would be 100 percent behind that.”

He was gathering his things — he had a shift at the salon — and his tone was calm. He is only 26. There is plenty of time. He was waiting for cues from his leader.

“In Trump we trust, and as far as everything else, it’s all going to fall into place,” he said. “It’s not happening today, and it’s not happening tomorrow.”"
"Praying, Dancing, Waiting: Americans Hang On for the Election’s End","

PITTSBURGH — At 8:50 on Friday morning, the city of Philadelphia updated its vote tally, nudging Joseph R. Biden Jr. past Donald J. Trump in the state of Pennsylvania. The question on everyone’s mind for several interminable days immediately shifted: not ‘‘if” but “when.” The election — this tense, angry, virus-plagued and exhausting election — would soon be over.

“We’re celebrating everybody’s right to vote,” said Bernadette Golarz, 36, amid the impromptu street party that broke out on Friday in front of the Pennsylvania Convention Center, where ballots were still being counted inside. “And the fact that we all showed up to put him out.”

The country has waited three nerve-racking days for news of a definite outcome. All that time, the nation’s fate has been cast, just not yet fully known, as local election offices scattered across a handful of states counted the crucial remaining ballots. Voters of both parties have stayed up late and woken up early, praying, hoping, refreshing feeds and staring at maps on the TV that never seemed to change.

“What is happening now is what I thought was going to happen,” said Rosemary Gabriel, 51, who moved from Nigeria 19 years ago to the Atlanta suburbs where she now lives and works, “because I still have faith in the American people.”

For all that confidence in the outcome, though, she had been glued to the TV all week. “I’ve had four hours of sleep,” she said.

As the tally tediously proceeded, the president falsely declared victory and raged about conspiracy, one of his sons urged “total war” over the election, his campaign’s lawyers filed a squall of lawsuits, and crowds of supporters took to the streets demanding that election officials stop counting or keep counting depending on where they were.

“I feel like things are being yanked from underneath me,” said Joel Medina, 44, a businessman from Rowlett, Texas, who cast the first vote in his life on Tuesday for Mr. Trump. He had not ruled out that Mr. Trump would eventually come out on top.

Still, even some of those with deep suspicions about the election had resigned themselves to a Biden victory. It was proof, as they saw it, that in the end the swamp always wins.

“I’ll never forget it, they were so shocked when he got elected,” recalled Kim Anzelmi, 55, of Scranton, Pa., who had assumed politics to be irredeemably rigged until the night Mr. Trump won in November 2016. That election had changed her mind about the system and what was possible — briefly. Now she is as cynical about it as ever. “Politics has been crooked since the Romans,” she said.

But Dolores Selico, who cast a ballot for Mr. Biden on Tuesday in a high school gymnasium in South Los Angeles, was confident that whatever would transpire would be “God’s will.”

When Ms. Selico voted, she wore a T-shirt bearing the face of John Lewis, the late civil rights pioneer. It was a way to honor “what our ancestors went through so we could vote,” said Ms. Selico, a Black woman who is 80 years old.

Shanna Davidson, a social worker in Louisville, Ky., who also backed Mr. Biden, had seen enough to feel relief.

“Today’s a good day,” she said. Still, she recognized that tens of millions of Americans voted differently from her, and would be as dejected as she was now invigorated. The election appeared so close when she woke up on Wednesday morning, she said, that “I about had a nervous breakdown.”

This was the thing, though. In this strange and ongoing limbo of an uncalled election, there was still plenty of anxiety to go around. For every Biden voter like Susan Macovsky, buying bottles of prosecco at a Pennsylvania liquor store to celebrate — even if perhaps a little prematurely, she admitted — there was another, like Rachael Lindemann, relieved but still nervous.

“I’m not going to count my chickens before they’re hatched,” she said.

There had been plenty of evidence in her life that things could change suddenly and inexplicably. Her husband, a struggling dairy farmer in Albany, Wis., had supported Mr. Trump in 2016, while she had voted for Hillary Clinton. But Mr. Trump’s trade war with China ravaged their finances, and they eventually had to sell their farm and cows. Mr. Lindemann took a construction job. This year, he voted for Mr. Biden.

For now, Ms. Lindemann was not celebrating. “I know he’s going to throw a 5-year-old tantrum and he’s going to turn over every table he can,” she said of Mr. Trump. “We don’t have a president yet.”

There are many, like Ms. Lindemann, whose vote was personal, a first chance to answer the president for what he brought or took away from them.

Nephtalie Hyacinthe, 42, a Haitian immigrant in Miramar, Fla., took her citizenship exam the day after Mr. Trump was elected in 2016. She viewed his first term as a four-year civics lesson that would help shape her political views and prepare her for the 2020 election.

She studied the president, listening as he took a hard line on immigrants and hearing reports of the disparaging things he called her homeland. And so on the last day of October, Ms. Hyacinthe weighed in, casting her first vote in America for Mr. Biden at a library. As she learned this week, she had picked the likely winner.

“For an immigrant, voting represents the white picket fence,” she said, her voice quaking with excitement. “This means I am an American citizen and I helped to pick our next leader.”

Just as Ms. Hyacinthe was discovering in her adopted country, plenty of people who have lived here from birth had learned — this week and over the past four years — that it was perhaps not the country they thought they had known.

“I’m sort of sick to my stomach,” said Sam Diana, a 55-year-old antiques dealer in Scranton — and a lifelong Democrat — who voted for Mr. Trump. He had been lying on the couch watching the returns for days, learning on Friday morning during a trip to Sam’s Club that his state had likely flipped to Mr. Biden. “I definitely, definitely, definitely believe it was fixed.”

Beneath all this, however, lay deep and unresolved questions about what was happening in the country and in the minds of his fellow citizens.

“Something’s going on in America — something scary,” Mr. Diana said. “It makes you get a lump in your throat when you think, Is this really America? Are we all partners? Why did they hate that man so much?”

Across the state in Erie that same morning, Karen Moski, 67, was leaving the house for work when she learned that Mr. Biden was now ahead in Pennsylvania. Among friends the night before she had found out that her home county, a reliably Democratic stronghold that had shockingly sent most of its votes to Mr. Trump four years ago, had also turned back to blue again.

“We’re getting rid of Donald Trump and that has been my goal for years,” she said, laughing at the realization that an outspoken Trump-supporting colleague would be coming into the office later that day. Perhaps Erie’s reversal was a sign the county had “probably just made a mistake” in 2016.

But there was no going back completely. Ms. Moski had learned things about her city over the last four years, she said, opinions that friends had about race and politics that had surprised her. Biden victory or not, Erie — and the country — would never be the same.

“That was an awakening,” she said. “We have some work to do.”

Voters Say Black Lives Matter Protests Were Important. They Disagree On Why.,"The protests that broke out after the police killing of George Floyd in May were some of the biggest racial justice marches organized in decades. In the early weeks, polling showed broad and deep support for them across the country.

But as the summer wore on and with it, sporadic looting and acts of vandalism, Americans became much more divided in how they saw the protests.

Just how divided became clear on Election Day.

Alfonse Bowman of Philadelphia said that as he cast his ballot for Joseph R. Biden Jr., he was thinking of how just a week before, the police in his hometown had fatally shot a young Black man. Mr. Bowman, who is Black, said he thought to himself of President Trump: “We have to get this man out of office.”

But Anne Marie Kelly, a white medical worker who lives a couple of hours away in Stroudsburg, Pa., said she was horrified by the vandalism and looting that followed protests in some cities. It made her feel that “this is not the America I want to live in anymore,” and reinforced her resolve to vote for Mr. Trump.

As the election grinds to a close, and the nation begins sifting through the results, one thing is clear: The protests this summer and what came after weighed heavily on Americans’ minds.

About nine of every 10 voters said the protests over police violence were a factor in their voting, with more than three-fourths calling it a major factor, according to preliminary data from A.P. VoteCast, a large voter survey conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago. About a fifth of all voters said the protests were the single most important factor in their decision at the ballot box, according to the survey, which interviewed over 140,000 respondents by phone and online.

But these voters were split deeply on who should be in the White House. Among those who cited the protests as a factor, 53 percent voted for Mr. Biden, and 46 percent for Mr. Trump, according to the survey.

Interviews with a number of voters this week showed there were strong differences that often ran along racial lines — with many Black voters viewing the protests through the lens of police violence threatening their lives, while many conservative white voters saw unrest encroaching on their communities.

“All this rioting, it’s childish,” said Crystal Daddario, 32, who was standing in line to vote for Mr. Trump outside a fire station in Reeders, Pa., on Tuesday. Ms. Daddario, who is Hispanic, is the wife of an Iraq War veteran, and said they were living in Louisville, Ky., where the police killed Breonna Taylor during a botched raid, but “left because it was getting too close to home.”

The protests, which drew many white Americans as well, were especially potent as an issue in places like Louisville and Minneapolis, where Mr. Floyd was killed. Unrest also roiled Philadelphia, where dozens were arrested and many police officers hurt in late October after the fatal police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr., a Black man with a history of mental illness.

Mr. Bowman, 19, a student at Morehouse College in Atlanta who is taking classes online from home there, said he watched a protest from his car. He said he yelled at the police, and claimed that an officer came over and struck him in the face with a baton, fracturing bones in his face.

The experience “made me want to vote, and it made me want to help other people understand the importance of voting,” he said. His vote for Mr. Biden was the first of his life.

In the heady early days of the protests, several months before Election Day, liberal activists began making calls to “defund the police,” arguing that reducing police department budgets would allow for greater investments into communities struggling with poverty.

The electoral impact of that message is now being debated by Democrats, who emerged from Tuesday’s results with a weakened majority in the House. During a conference call among House Democrats on Thursday, Abigail Spanberger, a centrist Democrat in a Republican-leaning district in Virginia, angrily blamed liberals for embracing the “defund the police” movement. Ms. Spanberger, who narrowly escaped defeat, had faced an opponent who attacked her by tying her to the “defund” message.

But Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, a leader of the Progressive Caucus, said that embracing liberal messages had energized young voters, “who will ultimately save the day in the race for the White House.”

During the campaign Mr. Biden distanced himself from the progressive wing of his party and said he opposed cutting resources for law enforcement. Regardless, Mr. Trump, running on a “law and order” message, often made false claims about Mr. Biden’s record on fighting crime.

It is too early to tell precisely how much of the greatly increased turnout — the highest rate of eligible voters since the turn of the 20th century, according to the United States Elections Project — went to Mr. Biden and whether the protests were a driving force.

But there are clues that they might have helped. In Wayne County, Mich., which includes Detroit, there were more votes cast this year than during Barack Obama’s re-election bid in 2012, a recent high-water mark for Black voter turnout.

In Jefferson County, which includes Louisville, turnout did not reach 2012 levels but rose by more than 10 percent this election compared with 2016.

Bernice Bigham, a 75-year-old Louisville resident, wore a T-shirt into the voting booth that summed up her feelings. It read, in all caps, “Black Voters Matter.” On the back it said, “It’s About Us.”

“I’m fearful,” said Ms. Bigham, who voted for Mr. Biden. “Every time there’s a killing, I’m calling around to make sure that my Black son and my Black grandsons are OK, and that’s no way to live — it’s awful.”

And in Flower Mound, Texas, Brooke Wright, 39, often voted Republican because she opposed abortion, but this fall she voted for Mr. Biden. On down ballot races, she and her husband selected women and minority candidates.

Ms. Wright, who is white and goes to an evangelical church, had gone to her first Black Lives Matter protest this summer. Tears streamed down her face as she held a sign to support her husband, who is Black, and their two biracial young sons.

“The protests made me want change so much,” she said. “I was ready to have the hard conversations with people who didn’t understand why I didn’t vote Republican anymore, instead of quietly staying out of those conversations.”

There is also evidence that the protests helped Mr. Trump.

“Downtown’s tore all to hell,” said Teresa Stidham, 43, a white Louisville resident, noting that the windows of many buildings in downtown have been covered by plywood for months. She said that she voted for Mr. Trump primarily because he would fight for the working class, but that the city’s civil unrest was an important factor, too.

In Minneapolis, Adrian Anderson, a retail worker, said he was turned off by the vandalism and looting of businesses in the aftermath of protests over the killing of Mr. Floyd.

“I don’t think it’s Trump’s fault that the police are acting the way they are acting,” said Mr. Anderson, 30, who is Black, white and Native American. He said he voted for Mr. Trump.

Black voters said they did not think Mr. Biden would be a fix for all of the problems of policing in their communities. But at least he acknowledged systemic racism, they said, something Mr. Trump has refused to do. They hoped that Mr. Trump’s exit would mean more civility.

“We’ve got a lot of people who have shown their face and their horns,” said Lakaisha Stoner, 27, a small-business owner in Louisville, adding that she hoped racism would be less on display in the future. “I’m just ready for a positive change, I can’t stress that enough,” she said.

A new president is the place to start, she added.

In a sign that the video of a police officer killing Mr. Floyd had made an impression on the public, even among the president’s backers, 70 percent of voters polled in the A.P. VoteCast survey said racism in policing was a very serious or somewhat serious problem, and of those voters, three in 10 cast their ballots for Mr. Trump.

And for some immigrants who are neither Black nor white, the protests played in complicated ways. Jose Nunez, an electrician who immigrated from the Dominican Republic in 2002, said he voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, but this time voted for Mr. Biden. He switched because he had noticed an ugliness among supporters of Mr. Trump with flapping flags and angry signs. But, he said, the Democrats also needed to expand their appeal to him.

“I don’t want to be talking about race or police brutality on a daily basis,” he said. “It’s crazy.”

Others badly wanted both parties to talk about other things. Jose Soto, 37, a Navy veteran in Madison, Wis., who now works for the Department of Veterans Affairs, said he cared most about education and health care, but neither issue seemed to come up in the campaign. He liked Bernie Sanders, saying, “it feels like every time he talks, he talks to me,” and voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. On Tuesday, he voted for Mr. Trump.

“When Democrats focus their speech, it’s not on work or what they have to offer us,” said Mr. Soto, who immigrated from the Dominican Republic when he was 8.

As for protests, he said racial injustice had been around for a long time and the Democrats had not done much to solve it.

“I don’t think any candidate has a solution for that,” he said.

Kamala Harris Makes History as First Woman and Woman of Color as Vice President,"From the earliest days of her childhood, Kamala Harris was taught that the road to racial justice was long.

She spoke often on the campaign trail of those who had come before her, of her parents, immigrants drawn to the civil rights struggle in the United States — and of the ancestors who had paved the way.

As she took the stage in Texas shortly before the election, Ms. Harris spoke of being singular in her role but not solitary.

“Yes, sister, sometimes we may be the only one that looks like us walking in that room,” she told a largely Black audience in Fort Worth. “But the thing we all know is we never walk in those rooms alone — we are all in that room together.”

With her ascension to the vice presidency, Ms. Harris will become the first woman and first woman of color to hold that office, a milestone for a nation in upheaval, grappling with a damaging history of racial injustice exposed, yet again, in a divisive election. Ms. Harris, 56, embodies the future of a country that is growing more racially diverse, even if the person voters picked for the top of the ticket is a 77-year-old white man.

In her victory speech Saturday, Ms. Harris spoke of her mother and the generations of women of all races who paved the way for this moment. “While I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last,” she told a cheering and honking audience in Wilmington, Del. “Because every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities.”

That she has risen higher in the country’s leadership than any woman ever has underscores the extraordinary arc of her political career. A former San Francisco district attorney, she was elected as the first Black woman to serve as California’s attorney general. When she was elected a United States senator in 2016, she became only the second Black woman in the chamber’s history.

Almost immediately, she made a name for herself in Washington with her withering prosecutorial style in Senate hearings, grilling her adversaries in high-stakes moments that at times went viral.

Yet what also distinguished her was her personal biography: The daughter of a Jamaican father and Indian mother, she was steeped in racial justice issues from her early years in Oakland and Berkeley, Calif., and wrote in her memoir of memories of the chants, shouts and “sea of legs moving about” at protests. She recalled hearing Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman to mount a national campaign for president, speak in 1971 at a Black cultural center in Berkeley that she frequented as a young girl. “Talk about strength!” she wrote. 

After several years in Montreal, Ms. Harris attended Howard University, a historically Black college and one of the country’s most prestigious, then pursued work as a prosecutor on domestic violence and child exploitation cases. She speaks easily and often of her mother, a breast cancer researcher who died in 2009; of her white and Jewish husband, Douglas Emhoff, who will make history in his own right as the first second gentleman; and of her stepchildren, who call her Momala.

It was a story she tried to tell on the campaign trail during the Democratic primary with mixed success. Kicking off her candidacy with homages to Ms. Chisholm, Ms. Harris attracted a crowd in Oakland that her advisers estimated at more than 20,000, a tremendous show of strength that immediately established her as a front-runner in the race. But vying for the nomination against the most diverse field of candidates in history, she failed to capture a surge of support and dropped out weeks before any votes were cast.

Part of her challenge, especially with the party’s progressive wing she sought to win over, was the difficulty she had reconciling her past positions as California’s attorney general with the current mores of her party. She struggled to define her policy agenda, waffling on health care and even her own assault on Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s record on race, perhaps the toughest attack he faced throughout the primary campaign.

“Policy has to be relevant,” Ms. Harris said in an interview with The New York Times in July 2019. “That’s my guiding principle: Is it relevant? Not, ‘Is it a beautiful sonnet?’”

But it is also this lack of ideological rigidity that makes her well suited for the vice presidency, a role that demands a tempering of personal views in deference to the man at the top. As the vice-presidential nominee, Ms. Harris has endeavored to make plain that she supports Mr. Biden’s positions — even if some differ from those she backed during the primary.

While she struggled to attract the very women and Black voters she had hoped would connect with her personal story during her primary bid, she continued to make a concerted effort as Mr. Biden’s running mate to reach out to people of color, some of whom have said they feel represented in national politics for the first time.

Many witnessed — and recoiled at — the persistent racist and sexist attacks from conservatives. President Trump has refused to pronounce her name correctly and after the vice-presidential debate, he derided her as a “monster.”

For some of her supporters, the vitriol Ms. Harris had to withstand was another aspect of her experience they found relatable.

“I know what I was thrown into as the only African-American at the table,” said Clara Faulkner, the mayor pro tem of Forest Hill, Texas, as she waited for Ms. Harris to address a socially distanced crowd in Fort Worth. “It’s just seeing God move in a mighty way.”

While some members of the political establishment professed outrage at the insults, friends of Ms. Harris knew that her pragmatism extended to her understanding of how the political world treats women of color.

Senator Cory Booker, a colleague and friend of Ms. Harris’s who has known her for decades, said in an interview that some of her guardedness was a form of self-protection in a world that has not always embraced a barrier-breaking Black woman.

“She still has this grace about her where it’s almost as if these things don’t affect her spirit,” Mr. Booker said. “She’s endured this for her entire career and she does not give people license to have entrance into her heart.”

After waiting days for results, Democrats rejoiced in a victory that offered a bright spot in an election that delivered losses to many of their candidates, including several high-profile women.

Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, who got involved in politics through Ms. Chisholm’s presidential campaign, said she always believed she would see the first Black woman at the steps of the White House.

“Here you have now this remarkable, brilliant, prepared African-American woman, South Asian woman, ready to fulfill the dreams and aspirations of Shirley Chisholm and myself and so many women of color,” she said. “This is exciting and is finally a breakthrough that so many of us have been waiting for. And it didn’t come easy.”

The Democrats’ down-ballot defeats tempered the celebratory mood a bit, as did a wistful sense among some activists and leaders that this historic first still leaves women in second place — closer than ever to the Oval Office, sure, but not in it.

The end to a presidency that inspired waves of opposition from women, many politically engaged for the first time, has left the “highest, hardest glass ceiling” intact. Democratic primary voters, including a significant number of women, had rallied behind Mr. Biden, eschewing the women and people of color in the race because they believed Mr. Biden would be most capable of beating Mr. Trump. Scarred by Hillary Clinton’s defeat four years ago, many believed the country was not quite ready to elect a female commander in chief.

Ms. Harris’s presence on the ticket will forever be linked to Mr. Biden’s explicit promise to select a female running mate in an acknowledgment that the party’s future probably does not look like him.

Ms. Harris now finds herself the most clearly positioned heir to the White House. Perhaps more than any other vice president in recent memory, she will be carefully scrutinized for her ambitions, a level of attention that is perhaps inevitable for the No. 2 of the oldest incoming No. 1 in history.

Mr. Biden understands this, Mr. Booker said: “He is really bringing us to the next election.”

Allies say Ms. Harris is acutely aware of her place in history. She views her work as connected to both the civil rights leaders who came before her — the “ancestors,” as she calls them — and the generations she hopes to empower. 

Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington, a rising figure in the party’s left wing, said Ms. Harris’s ascent was a deep source of pride among South Asians, expanding the imaginations of how high they can climb in American public life. Ms. Jayapal has spoken proudly of her own connection to the new vice president, writing an op-ed article in The Los Angeles Times in August describing their intertwined family history in South India.

“She understands what it means to be the child of immigrants — what it means to be a person of color seeking racial justice,” she said, pointing to Ms. Harris’s work on rights for domestic workers and helping Muslim immigrants get access to legal counsel. “There’s just so much you don’t have to explain to a Vice President Harris and I believe she will fight for many of the issues that are important to our South Asian community.”

The small sorority of Black women in federal politics also views Ms. Harris as a mentor and an ally, praising her championing of issues like Black maternal mortality and anti-lynching legislation that have not typically received the spotlight that can follow a high-wattage political brand.

When Representative Lauren Underwood was mounting her first race for Congress, trying to become the first Black woman to win her predominantly white suburban Chicago district, Ms. Harris reached out for coffee.

“There’s not that many Black women who have been at the highest level of politics in this country. Not that many Black women who have run very competitive races,” said Ms. Underwood, who became the youngest Black woman ever elected to Congress in 2018. “To have the opportunity to learn from, counsel from and just know someone who has done that is something I find incredibly valuable.”

Kimberlé Crenshaw, a prominent Black progressive scholar, hailed Ms. Harris’s ascension to the vice presidency and described her as “well positioned to weather the storms that will definitely come now that she has broken through the glass ceiling.”

But amid the joy and sense of empowerment in seeing a woman of color as the nation’s second-highest elected official, she also cautioned that the history-making moment should not distract progressives from continuing to push their agenda.

“This is still the Biden administration — what Kamala Harris thinks or does has to be recognized as being part of that administration,” she said. “So we cannot let the pedal to the metal be slowed in any way because we’re celebrating the fact that we’ve had this breakthrough moment.”

For others, that moment has been a very long time coming.

Opal Lee, 94, paid a poll tax when she first went to vote, choosing between casting her ballot for the Democratic candidate or buying food for her four young children. Decades later, Ms. Lee, a former teacher and activist from Fort Worth, Texas, celebrated at President Barack Obama’s inauguration.

Despite the health risks from the coronavirus pandemic, Ms. Lee has no intention of missing Mr. Biden’s inauguration in Washington this January — to witness Ms. Harris.

“I want to be able to tell my great-great-grandchildren how it felt for a woman to be vice president,” she said. “I just got to go.”"
The Electoral College Is Close. The Popular Vote Isn’t.,"As the presidential race inches agonizingly toward a conclusion, it might be easy to miss the fact that the results are not really close.

With many ballots still left to count in heavily Democratic cities, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was leading President Trump on Friday by more than 4.1 million votes. Amid all the anxiety over the counts in Pennsylvania and Georgia, and despite Americans’ intense ideological divisions, there was no question that — for the fourth presidential election in a row, and the seventh of the past eight — more people had chosen a Democrat than a Republican.

Only once in the past 30 years have more Americans voted for a Republican: in 2004, when President George W. Bush beat John Kerry by about three million votes. But three times, a Republican has been elected.

Mr. Biden is very likely to win the Electoral College, avoiding another split with the popular vote. But the prolonged uncertainty in spite of the public’s fairly decisive preference — Mr. Biden’s current vote margin is larger than the populations of more than 20 states, and larger than Hillary Clinton’s margin in 2016 — has intensified some Americans’ anger at a system in which a minority of people can often claim a majority of power.

“We look at a map of so-called red and blue states and treat that map as land and not people,” said Carol Anderson, a professor of African-American studies at Emory University who researches voter suppression. “Why, when somebody has won millions more votes than their opponent, are we still deliberating over 10,000 votes here, 5,000 votes there?”

In principle, the Electoral College could benefit either party depending on the geographic distribution of its supporters. As recently as four years ago, it looked like it would help Democrats, and in 2004, if Mr. Kerry had won just 119,000 more votes in Ohio out of more than 5.6 million cast there, he would have won the presidency despite losing the popular vote.

But in practice, it has overwhelmingly benefited Republicans in recent years despite the national electorate tilting the other way. And the potential for the Electoral College to diverge from the popular vote has only grown as more Americans have come to live in urban areas and many communities have become more ideologically homogeneous.

In 2000, when Al Gore won the popular vote by about 550,000 votes but Mr. Bush won the Electoral College, such a split hadn’t happened in more than a century. Now, it has happened twice in 20 years and come close to happening a third time, despite much larger popular-vote margins. What used to be an extreme rarity has begun to feel common.

Therein lies a more serious concern than partisan politics: the potential delegitimization of the United States’ democratic systems in the eyes of its citizens.

“The more this happens, the more you get the sense that voters don’t have a say in the choice of their leaders,” said Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. “And you cannot have a democracy over a period of time that survives if a majority of people believe that their franchise is meaningless.”

The United States, as supporters of the Electoral College often note, is a republic, meaning decisions are made through elected representatives rather than by direct vote. But “the fundamental of a republican form of democracy,” Dr. Ornstein said, “is that voters choose their representatives, who then make decisions on their behalf.”

The prospect of minority rule is certainly not new, and the fact that the Constitution allows it is by design, not accident. When the Constitution was ratified, most states only allowed white, male property owners to vote.

The three-fifths clause, which counted slaves as three-fifths of a person for the purposes of congressional apportionment, gave Southern states more representation on the backs of people who couldn’t vote for and weren’t represented by their ostensible representatives. By 1820, Dr. Anderson said, the South had 18 to 20 extra seats in the House as a result.

The framers also consciously made the Senate unrepresentative, giving each state two seats regardless of population and leaving it to state legislators to fill them. The intent was for the Senate to serve as a check on the will of the people, which was to be represented in the House.

But the 17th Amendment established direct election of senators in 1913, and the difference in population between the largest and smallest states has vastly increased since the Constitution was written. The current Democratic minority in the Senate was elected with more votes than the Republican majority, and by 2040, based on population projections, about 70 percent of Americans will be represented by 30 percent of senators.

Nearly a century ago, Carroll H. Wooddy published an academic paper that examined the likelihood of “unrepresentative votes” in the Senate, by which he meant votes in which senators on the winning side represented fewer Americans than senators on the losing side. He concluded that these votes happened infrequently, largely because “there has been no continuous alliance of thinly populated states against the more densely peopled areas.”

Today, of course, population density is very much correlated with partisanship, and the makeup of the Senate is unrepresentative of the population not only in party but in race, gender, age and other characteristics.

Supporters of the Electoral College argue that it protects less-populous states, ensuring that their interests aren’t overridden by those of, say, New York and California. At the same time, opponents note that the system means candidates pay attention only to a small number of states, and that it devalues the votes of people in either party who live in a state dominated by the other. Republicans in Illinois don’t affect presidential elections, and neither do Democrats in Tennessee.

It remains to be seen whether the 2020 election will give new fuel to efforts to eliminate or circumvent the Electoral College, which have always been long shots even though a majority of Americans — 61 percent in a Gallup poll released in September; 58 percent in a Pew Research Center poll in March — believe it should be abolished.

John Koza, the chairman of National Popular Vote Inc., said his group — which has been pushing state legislatures for years to sign on to a compact in which states would pledge to award their electors to the winner of the national popular vote — planned to lobby intensively next year in states including Arizona, Minnesota, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. The compact has already been signed by states, mainly blue, totaling 196 electoral votes, but it will not take effect unless that number reaches 270.

Dr. Koza, a computer scientist who taught at Stanford University, argues that the Electoral College should be abolished not because it systematically benefits one party over the other, but because it increases the odds that election results will be challenged even when Americans’ overall preference is clear — precisely what is happening now.

“When you split the 150 million votes into 50 buckets, there’s going to be close results in a certain number of the states,” he said. This “spawns disputes, and then it spawns lawyers running into court over hairsplitting issues, trying to win the White House for their candidate even though their candidate hasn’t won the support of people across the country.”

While the idea of abolishing the Electoral College is popular mainly among Democrats now, there was more bipartisan support before the 2016 election made it clear how much it could benefit Republicans. Before 2016, a common interpretation had been the opposite: that Democrats had the advantage because of the now-famous “blue wall” that included Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

“Republicans are disappearing from the competitive landscape at the national level across the most heavily populated sections of the country while intensifying their hold on a declining electoral bloc of aging, white, rural voters,” Chris Ladd, a conservative writer, wrote in The Houston Chronicle after the 2014 midterm elections. “It became apparent from the numbers last week that no Republican candidate has a credible shot at the White House in 2016, and the chance of the G.O.P. holding the Senate for longer than two years is precisely zero.”

In early 2016, a bill that would have added Missouri to the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact passed legislative committees unanimously, and similar bills received at least some bipartisan support in Oklahoma and Utah.

But “legislators didn’t have much appetite for it once Trump won the way he did,” Dr. Koza said. “The issue is bipartisan when it’s looked at as a policy issue of what’s good government, what’s the right way to do it. But anything else inevitably becomes intertwined with, does one party think they have a temporary political advantage by keeping the system the same?”"
"In Texas, an Emerging Problem for Democrats on the Border","ZAPATA, Texas — Democrats spent years focusing on how they could finally win Texas. But since Tuesday’s election, they have been wrestling with a more pressing question: How did they lose Zapata County?

In the reliably Democratic and majority-Hispanic stronghold of South Texas, Zapata County, population 14,179, had never been a political bellwether. It is a largely rural border community on a narrow stretch of the Rio Grande between Laredo and McAllen, home to oil-field workers and one of the highest poverty rates in Texas.

Mitt Romney lost Zapata County in 2012 by 43 percentage points. Donald J. Trump lost it in 2016 by 33. Ted Cruz lost it in 2018 by 26. On Tuesday, President Trump reversed many years of political history, including his own, and won Zapata County by 5 percentage points.

“When I would tell people I helped a friend sell air fresheners in the shape of Trump’s head, I would apologize because I supported Trump,” said Anna Holcomb, 55, a Latina and former oil-field administrative assistant who lives in Zapata, the county seat.

“Why should I apologize for it? I’m not going to apologize anymore. Just because the president wants people to come into the country the right way, it doesn’t make him a racist. He’s not a racist and neither am I.”

The flipping of Zapata County was one of many Republican victories in a state that Mr. Trump carried. But it stunned Democrats and reflected their enduring struggle in the country’s largest conservative-led state. Not only do Democrats have a problem surging forward, they may be going backward in places.

“When I was running, I’d get 85 percent in Zapata County — and Trump carried it,” said Garry Mauro, 72, a Democrat and former state land commissioner who was the chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign in Texas in 2016. “The idea that Trump, who has been so overtly racist about Hispanics in particular, was able to do so well has got to be a failure of our party not having a message.”

In the aftermath of Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory in the national election, a changing Texas remained largely unchanged.

Mr. Trump defeated Mr. Biden in Texas, winning a more narrow victory than he had in 2016 but winning nonetheless. Senator John Cornyn, a Republican, won re-election. Wendy Davis lost again, one of several Democrats who tried and failed to grab Republican-controlled congressional seats. A push to flip the Texas House foundered, as Republicans held on to their majority.

Texas is more politically and culturally complex than any one poll or election can capture. There were Houston oil-and-gas workers who voted for Mr. Trump, but many in the industry voted for Mr. Biden. There were longtime Democrats who, on the same ballot, voted for Mr. Biden and Mr. Cornyn. The president may have won Zapata County, but Mr. Cornyn lost it.

If there is any one force determining how Texans vote, it is neither party nor politics. It is something that resists party labels but has helped transform Texas from a place to a cause — an ideology disguised as a brand disguised as a state. It is a cliché to say Texas is filled with mavericks, but the whole notion of mavericks belongs uniquely to Texas — the word comes from the surname of a Texas rancher and lawyer who left his calves unbranded in the late 1800s, Samuel A. Maverick.

At first glance, Mr. Biden’s support in most of South Texas appears solid. He carried all four of the counties that make up the Rio Grande Valley region, next door to Zapata County. But a closer look reveals the emerging Democratic challenge on the border. Mr. Trump broadened his support in all four, plus in other border counties. In one of those communities, rural Starr County, Mrs. Clinton won in 2016 by 60 percentage points. On Tuesday, Mr. Biden carried it by just five.

South Texas has long been a place where a lot of people are politically liberal but culturally conservative.

Mexican-American families have called Brownsville, McAllen, Edinburg and other Rio Grande Valley cities home not for years but for generations. They identify with their Mexican roots just across the river but identify just as strongly with America. At the formal southern line of the nation, patriotism intensifies, and many an American flag waves in yards and on porches. Young Mexican-American men and women eagerly sign up to become Border Patrol agents. Often, their older relatives and neighbors worked for Border Patrol, and they are proud to do so, too, ignoring the perception of the agency among immigrant families elsewhere in the country.

These working-class and middle-class Mexican-Americans feel compassion for the Central American migrants who have been flooding the border off and on since 2014. Volunteering at migrant shelters and donating clothes and food have become Valley traditions. But many view those migrants as outsiders. The Hispanic migrant in a shelter and the Hispanic longtime Valley resident are culturally and economically disconnected.

Mr. Trump’s support in that context was not surprising.

“I believe that many Mexican-Americans who ordinarily vote Democratic are attracted to his personality,” said State Senator Judith Zaffirini, a Democrat who is Mexican-American and whose district includes Zapata County. “He’s very strong here. I don’t find him appealing but I’m fascinated by his appeal to so many Texans.”

The town of Zapata lies along five traffic lights on Highway 83.

Halloween decorations, hay bales and pumpkins were still up on a highway plaza in the aftermath of the election this week. Payday loan, auto parts and pawn shops outnumber gas stations and restaurants. The gentle western slope down to the Rio Grande gives residents spectacular sunsets and views of Mexico. In town and on the more rural roads around the county, where Border Patrol agents can be seen on hilltops gazing through binoculars across the river, there were an equal number of Trump signs and Biden signs.

Two of the few orchestrated Trump events in Zapata happened in September, when stickers and signs were handed out at a local restaurant and a “Trump Train” caravan rode through town.

But they did not draw huge crowds, and even now, some people who supported him said they feared retaliation for speaking out.

Many Trump voters in Zapata know one another, and they have formed an unofficial booster club and support group. It includes Ricardo Ramirez, 51, the president of a local bank branch, and Jack Moore, 45, an oil-field construction worker who said the Democrats of 50 years ago “are not the same Democrats today.”

Many residents in this part of Texas have strong Christian, anti-abortion, pro-gun and back-the-blue views that put them more in line with conservatives than liberals, and in Zapata, there is a strong sense among his supporters that Mr. Trump will bring jobs to the economically struggling region.

In a brief exchange during the final presidential debate, Mr. Biden had said he would “transition from the oil industry” because of its pollution, a remark that did not go unnoticed by Zapata residents, including Yvette Gutierrez De Leon, 56, who is a secretary for an oil-field services company and who voted for Mr. Trump.

“At the end of the day, in the little bit of oil field that is still left, if it goes away tomorrow our county will go away,” Ms. De Leon said. “Oil is all we have here.”

Isela Gonzalez-Lindquist, 42, a saleswoman at a Laredo mattress store, said she voted for Mr. Trump even though she was opposed to his plans to extend the border wall in the area, because she believed it would hurt wildlife and infringe on the rights of property owners.

“I want to convey that he is not perfect and we know that, but he is the best candidate for the job,” she said. “I like Trump’s grit and that he’s not a career politician.”

"Biden Wins Presidency, Ending Four Tumultuous Years Under Trump","Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was elected the 46th president of the United States on Saturday, promising to restore political normalcy and a spirit of national unity to confront raging health and economic crises, and making Donald J. Trump a one-term president after four years of tumult in the White House.

Mr. Biden’s victory amounted to a repudiation of Mr. Trump by millions of voters exhausted with his divisive conduct and chaotic administration, and was delivered by an unlikely alliance of women, people of color, old and young voters and a sliver of disaffected Republicans. Mr. Trump is only the third elected president since World War II to lose re-election, and the first in more than a quarter-century.

The result also provided a history-making moment for Mr. Biden’s running mate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, who will become the first woman to serve as vice president.

With his triumph, Mr. Biden, who turns 78 later this month, fulfilled his decades-long ambition in his third bid for the White House, becoming the oldest person elected president. A pillar of Washington who was first elected amid the Watergate scandal, and who prefers political consensus over combat, Mr. Biden will lead a nation and a Democratic Party that have become far more ideological since his arrival in the capital in 1973.

He offered a mainstream Democratic agenda, yet it was less his policy platform than his biography to which many voters gravitated. Seeking the nation’s highest office a half-century after his first campaign, Mr. Biden — a candidate in the late autumn of his career — presented his life of setback and recovery to voters as a parable for a wounded country.

Appearing Saturday night before supporters at a drive-in rally in Wilmington, Del., and speaking against the din of enthusiastic honking, Mr. Biden claimed the presidency and called on the country to reunite after what he described as a toxic political interlude.

“Let this grim era of demonization in America begin to end here and now,” he said. 

Without addressing Mr. Trump, the president-elect spoke directly to the president’s supporters and said he recognized their disappointment. “I’ve lost a couple of times myself,” he recalled of his past failures to win the presidency, before adding: “Now let’s give each other a chance.” 

In a statement earlier in the day, Mr. Trump insisted “this election is far from over” and vowed that his campaign would “start prosecuting our case in court” but offered no details.

Mr. Biden’s victory, which came 48 years to the day after he was first elected to the United States Senate, set off jubilant celebrations in Democratic-leaning cities. In Washington, people streamed into the streets near the White House and cheered as cars bearing American flags drove by honking.

The race, which concluded after four tense days of vote-counting in a handful of battlegrounds, was a singular referendum on Mr. Trump in a way no president’s re-election has been in modern times. He coveted the attention, and voters who either adored him or loathed him were eager to render judgment on his tenure. From the beginning to the end of the race, Mr. Biden made the president’s character central to his campaign.

This unrelenting focus propelled Mr. Biden to victory in historically Democratic strongholds in the industrial Midwest with Mr. Biden forging a coalition of suburbanites and big-city residents to claim at least three states his party lost in 2016. With ballots still being counted in several states, Mr. Biden was leading Mr. Trump in the popular vote by more than four million votes.

Yet even as they turned Mr. Trump out of office, voters sent a more uncertain message about the left-of-center platform Mr. Biden ran on as Democrats lost seats in the House and made only modest gains in the Senate. The divided judgment — a rare example of ticket splitting in partisan times — demonstrated that, for many voters, their disdain for the president was as personal as it was political.

Even in defeat, though, Mr. Trump demonstrated his enduring appeal to many white voters and his intense popularity in rural areas, underscoring the deep national divisions that Mr. Biden has vowed to heal.

In his address Saturday, Mr. Biden saluted Black voters, recalling how they revived his campaign at “its lowest ebb,” back in February, and vowed to honor their loyalty. He said the voters had made clear they wanted both parties “to cooperate in their interest” and said he’d reach out to Republicans and Democrats alike.

The outcome of the race came into focus slowly as states and municipalities grappled with the legal and logistical challenges of voting in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. With an enormous backlog of early and mail-in votes, some states reported their totals in a halting fashion that in the early hours of Wednesday painted a misleadingly rosy picture for Mr. Trump.

But as the big cities of the Midwest and West began to report their totals, the advantage in the race shifted the electoral map in Mr. Biden’s favor. By Wednesday afternoon, the former vice president had rebuilt much of the so-called blue wall in the Midwest, reclaiming the historically Democratic battlegrounds of Wisconsin and Michigan that Mr. Trump carried four years ago. And on Saturday, with troves of ballots coming in from Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, he took back Pennsylvania as well.

While Mr. Biden stopped short of claiming victory as the week unfolded, he appeared several times in his home state, Delaware, to express confidence that he could win, while urging patience as the nation awaited the results. Even as he sought to claim something of an electoral mandate, noting that he had earned more in the popular vote than any other candidate in history, Mr. Biden struck a tone of reconciliation.

It would soon be time, he said, “to unite, to heal, to come together as a nation.”

In the days after the election, Mr. Biden and his party faced a barrage of attacks from Mr. Trump. The president falsely claimed in a middle-of-the-night appearance at the White House on Wednesday that he had won the race and that Democrats were conjuring fraudulent votes to undermine him, a theme he renewed on Thursday evening in grievance-filled remarks conjuring up, with no evidence, a conspiracy to steal votes from him.

The president’s campaign aides adopted a tone of brash defiance as swing states fell to Mr. Biden, promising a flurry of legal action. But while Mr. Trump’s ire had the potential to foment political divisions, there was no indication that he could succeed with his seemingly improvisational legal strategy.

Through it all, the coronavirus and its ravages on the country hung over the election and shaped the choice for voters. Facing an electorate already fatigued by his aberrant conduct, the president effectively sealed his defeat by minimizing a pandemic that has created simultaneous health and economic crises.

Beginning with the outbreak of the virus in the country at the start of the year, through his own diagnosis last month and up to the last hours of the election, he disregarded his medical advisers and public opinion even as over 230,000 people in the United States perished.

Mr. Biden, by contrast, sought to channel the dismay of those appalled by Mr. Trump’s mismanagement of the pandemic. He offered himself as a safe harbor for a broad array of Americans, promising to guide the nation out of what he called the “dark winter” of the outbreak, rather than delivering a visionary message with bright ideological themes.

While the president ridiculed mask-wearing and insisted on continuing his large rallies, endangering his own staff members and supporters, Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris campaigned with caution, avoiding indoor events, insisting on social distancing and always wearing masks.

Convinced that he could win back the industrial Northern states that swung to Mr. Trump four years ago, Mr. Biden focused his energy on Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Mr. Biden triumphed in those states on the strength of overwhelming support from women, who voted in large numbers to repudiate Mr. Trump despite his last-minute pleas to “suburban housewives,” as he called them. 

Many of the women who decided the president’s fate were politically moderate college-educated suburbanites, who made their presence felt as an electoral force first in the 2018 midterm elections, when a historic wave of female candidates and voters served as the driving force behind the Democratic sweep to power in the House.

Even aside from the pandemic, the 2020 campaign unfolded against a backdrop of national tumult unequaled in recent history, including the House’s vote to impeach the president less than a year ago, a national wave of protests over racial injustice last spring, spasms of civil unrest throughout the summer, the death of a Supreme Court justice in September and the hospitalization of Mr. Trump in October.

Along the way, Mr. Trump played to his conservative base, seeking to divide the nation over race and cultural flash points. He encouraged those fears, and the underlying social divisions that fostered them. And for months he sought to sow doubt over the legitimacy of the political process.

Mr. Biden, in response, offered a message of healing that appealed to Americans from far left to center right. He made common cause by promising relief from the unceasing invective and dishonesty of Mr. Trump’s presidency.

The former vice president also sought to demonstrate his differences with the president with his selection of Ms. Harris, 56, whose presence on the ticket as the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants stood in stark contrast to Mr. Trump’s relentless scapegoating of migrants and members of racial-minority groups.

Mr. Biden will be only the second Catholic to attain the presidency, along with John F. Kennedy.

In an era when political differences have metastasized into tribal warfare, at least 74 million voters turned to a figure who has become known as the eulogist in chief for his empathy and friendships with Republicans and Democrats alike.

In a sign of how much Mr. Trump alienated traditional Republicans, a number of prominent members of the party endorsed Mr. Biden’s candidacy, including Cindy McCain, the widow of former Senator John McCain; the party’s other two presidential nominees this century, George W. Bush and Mitt Romney, declined to endorse Mr. Trump.

Yet for all his lofty language about uniting the country, Mr. Biden was a halting candidate who ran a cautious campaign, determined to ensure that the election became a referendum on Mr. Trump. The former vice president fully returned to the campaign trail only around Labor Day, and for weeks he limited his appearances to one state every other day or so. He went west of the Central time zone just once during the general election.

As he prepares to take the oath, he will return to Washington confronting a daunting set of crises. Mr. Biden will be pressed to swiftly secure and distribute a safe vaccine for the coronavirus, revive an economy that may be in even more dire shape in January than it is now, and address racial justice and policing issues that this year prompted some of the largest protests in American history.

And he will do so with a Congress that is far more polarized than the Senate he left over a decade ago, with many Republicans having embraced Mr. Trump’s nativist brand of populism and Democrats increasingly responsive to an energized left. If Mr. Biden cannot bridge that divide as president and elicit some cooperation from the G.O.P., he will face immense pressure from his party’s progressive wing to abandon conciliation for a posture of combat.

Mr. Biden has held out hope about working with Republican lawmakers while declining to support his party’s most ambitious goals, like single-payer health care and the Green New Deal; he has resisted structural changes such as adding justices to the Supreme Court.

This irked his party’s base but made it difficult for Republicans, from Mr. Trump down the ballot, to portray him as an extremist. Mr. Biden was largely absent from the appeals of G.O.P. candidates, who instead used their advertising to insist that the Democratic Party would be in the hands of more polarizing figures on the left such as Senator Bernie Sanders.

Unlike the last two Democrats who defeated incumbents after voters tired of Republican leadership, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, Mr. Biden will not arrive in the capital as a youthful outsider. Instead, he will fill out a Democratic leadership triumvirate, which includes Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, of lawmakers who are 70 or older.

Mr. Biden alluded to himself during the campaign as a transitional figure who would bring the country out of a crisis and then make way for a new generation. But he has privately rejected suggestions that he commit to serving just a single term, viewing that as an instant guarantee of lame-duck status.

One of the most significant tests of Mr. Biden’s presidency will be in how he navigates the widening divisions in his party.

He may enjoy a honeymoon, though, because of both the scale of the problems he is grappling with and the president he defeated.

This election represented the culmination of nearly four years of activism organized around opposing Mr. Trump, a movement that began with the Women’s March the day after his inauguration. Indeed, Mr. Biden’s election appeared less the unique achievement of a political standard-bearer than the apex of a political wave touched off by the 2016 election — one that Mr. Biden rode more than he directed it.

But Mr. Trump’s job approval rating never hit 50 percent and, when the coronavirus spread nationwide and Mr. Biden effectively claimed the Democratic nomination in March, the president’s hopes of running with a booming economy and against a far-left opponent evaporated at once.

Still, many Democrats were nervous and some Republicans were defiantly optimistic going into the election, both still gripped by Mr. Trump’s shocker four years ago. And well into the night Tuesday, it seemed as if the president might be able to do it again. But four days later, after a year of trial in America and four turbulent years of the Trump administration, victory was in hand for Mr. Biden."
A President-Elect Shaped by Tragedy and Tradition,"Thirty-three years ago, he was the fast-talking junior senator from Delaware with a chip on his shoulder, desperate to prove his gravitas during a brief, ill-fated presidential run.

The next time around, in 2008, he was the seasoned foreign policy hand and veteran lawmaker who strained to capture the imagination of Democratic presidential primary voters.

As he weighed a third attempt at the presidency last year, many Democrats feared he was too late. Too old, too moderate, too meandering to excite ascendant voices in his party, too rooted in the more civil politics of the past to nimbly handle Donald Trump.

Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. ran anyway. He ran as a grieving father who connected with a country in pain. As a relative centrist who emphasized character, stability and belief in bipartisanship over the particulars of a policy agenda. As a flawed, uneven campaigner whose vulnerabilities were ultimately drowned out by his opponent’s outsize weaknesses, and eclipsed by the seismic issues at stake, as the nation confronted the ravages of a deadly pandemic.

In many ways, he ran as the politician he has always been. And for one extraordinary election, that was enough.

“They’re not so much saying, ‘I’m investing in Joe Biden because of his philosophy,’” said former Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, who served with Mr. Biden and supported him this year. “They’re invested in Joe Biden because of him, of who they see as being a human being.”

Mr. Biden’s victory on Saturday is the culmination of a career that began in the Nixon era and spanned a half-century of political and social upheaval. But if the country, the political parties and Washington have changed since Mr. Biden, now 77, arrived in the Senate as a 30-year-old widower in 1973, some of his attitudes — about governing and about his fellow Americans — have hardly changed at all.

He still reveres institutions, defiantly champions compromise and sees politics more in terms of relationships than ideology. He has insisted that with Mr. Trump out of office, Republicans will have an “epiphany” about working with Democrats — a view that elides the fact that Republicans were rarely interested in working with the Obama administration when Mr. Biden was vice president.

Those beliefs, coupled with his reputation as an empathetic and experienced leader, made Mr. Biden acceptable to a broad coalition of Americans this year, including independents and some moderate Republicans.

Now, Mr. Biden’s convictions about how to unite the country and move forward will be tested as never before.

He will take the helm of a nation devastated by a health crisis, reeling from an economic downturn and divided over virtually every major political matter of the day, from how and even whether to confront climate change and racial injustice, to baseless questions from some of Mr. Trump’s supporters about the very legitimacy of free and fair election results.

His first priority, Mr. Biden has said, will be to bring the coronavirus under control, as he also works to invest in infrastructure and to promote economic growth. Mr. Biden has released a series of policy plans around all of those issues, and has made clear that a national emergency calls for urgent and ambitious action.

But the president-elect, a 36-year veteran of the Senate who has never embraced the most far-reaching progressive proposals, is also well aware that the partisan makeup of Washington may limit the scope of his agenda. He is unlikely to press for rapid, transformational change of institutions like the Supreme Court or to embrace the boldest proposals in the Green New Deal.

Yet for all of his instincts for consensus-building, he will face enormous and conflicting pressures when he returns to Washington.

Progressives who papered over their differences with Mr. Biden in the name of defeating Mr. Trump will quickly turn to fighting for their priorities, which may not always align with Mr. Biden’s goals or timeline.

“Where the progressive energy will really turn angry is if we see Biden really compromising on core principles,” warned Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.

Even his closest allies believe there are elements of his long record that should be reconsidered from the White House, including the legacy of the crime bills passed during his tenure in the Senate. Mr. Biden for years served as a tough-on-crime Democrat, and he has sometimes struggled to account for his leading role in the 1994 crime bill, which many experts now associate with mass incarceration.

“He needs to put together a commission or a committee to study the 1986 and 1994 crime bills,” said Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the highest-ranking Black official in Congress, describing mass incarceration as an unintended consequence. “We’ve got to rectify.”

And Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the powerful Republican leader, has a relationship with Mr. Biden — but he is unlikely to be moved by encomiums to bipartisanship and civility.

“Joe is a peacemaker — he’s always tried to get along with Republicans,” said Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat and the former Senate majority leader.

But he was skeptical that Republican leaders in Congress would feel similarly about curbing divisiveness in Washington.

“I just hope Joe’s right and I’m wrong,” he said, “but I don’t see that coming to an end.”

Mr. Biden was a mediocre student with big ambitions, a gregarious young football player from an Irish Catholic family who overcame a stutter and dreamed of running for president.

In the meantime, he settled for school politics, serving as class president at his Catholic high school and adopting an approachable manner that he would deploy decades later on the campaign trail.

“The joke was, if Joe stood next to a light pole, he’d strike up a conversation,” said Bob Markel, a childhood friend of Mr. Biden’s. “You were talking to him for 20 seconds, he’d put out his hand and say, ‘Joe Biden.’”

He came from a line of politically engaged Pennsylvanians on his mother’s side, with a great-grandfather who served as a state senator. His father was a dignified man who had struggled financially, “a student of history with an unyielding sense of justice,” Mr. Biden said in his eulogy. Joseph R. Biden Sr., who moved the family from Scranton, Pa., to Delaware when Mr. Biden was 10, shaped his son’s moral compass and instilled in him a strong sense of identity; his story looms large in Mr. Biden’s efforts today to connect with working-class Americans.

Mr. Biden enrolled at the University of Delaware, where he threw himself into politics as freshman class president. He participated in the occasional high jinks, though even then he was fairly conservative in his personal manner.

“It’s the same style that I think we’ve seen since he was a teenager,” Mr. Markel said. “That moderation can be seen when he was in his teens. He was a fun-loving guy, certainly outgoing, but he didn’t do crazy things.”

For all of his political ambitions, he was at a remove from the antiwar activism taking hold among his peers in the caldron of the 1960s, and he was not one for protesting. After graduating from law school, he followed a path into institutional Democratic politics: young lawyer, part-time public defender and rising star within the Delaware party establishment.

At the end of that decade, party elders suggested he try his hand at a seat on the New Castle County Council.

“I spent most of my time in heavily Democratic precincts,” Mr. Biden recalled, describing the race in a memoir. “But I also spent a great deal of time going door to door in the middle-class neighborhoods like the one I grew up in. They were overwhelmingly Republican in 1970, but I knew how to talk to them.”

At the age of 30, Mr. Biden was moving swiftly in his political career. But personally, he was a broken man.

In a day, he had gone from a married father of three who won a startling victory in the 1972 Senate race to a widower with two toddlers in the hospital after a car crash killed his wife, Neilia, and their baby daughter, Naomi.

For months, he struggled to adjust to the Senate job he had wanted so badly.

Decades later, one of his surviving sons, Beau, would die of brain cancer. Mr. Biden, by then vice president, would be shattered anew.

Yet those staggering personal losses, friends say, shaped Mr. Biden’s uncommon ability to empathize — perhaps his greatest strength.

On the campaign trail, he never spoke with deeper authority than when he promised a grieving voter that one day, the memory of a loved one would bring a smile before a tear. His skill at connecting with voters in pain, allies say, uniquely prepared him to run for president amid a pandemic that has killed more than 237,000 people in the United States and upended the lives of many others on Mr. Trump’s watch.

“He understood the emotional trauma that Trump has inflicted on the country in a way that most of the other candidates didn’t,” said Shailagh Murray, who was a top aide to Mr. Biden as vice president.

After the 1972 accident, Mr. Biden slowly began rebuilding his life, later marrying Jill Jacobs and having a daughter, Ashley.

And eventually, he settled into Washington, too, where his early instincts for bipartisanship and working within the system were reinforced by mentors like Mike Mansfield, the longtime Senate majority leader.

Mr. Biden rose to lead the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee. He advanced signature policy achievements like the Violence Against Women Act and an assault weapons ban, and he developed relationships with leaders around the world. He torpedoed the nomination of Robert H. Bork to the Supreme Court, a setback that some Republicans remain bitter about to this day, and championed the confirmation of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

His tenure in the Senate is also associated with what many Americans see as the mistreatment of Anita Hill before his committee during the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Clarence Thomas; with his vote for the Iraq war and his opposition to busing; and with his leading efforts on the 1994 crime bill that troubled some voters throughout the campaign.

As he navigated Congress, Mr. Biden built relationships with similarly consensus-minded Republicans like Senators Bob Dole, Arlen Specter and John McCain.

But Mr. Biden, who has said he was motivated to run for office in part by a belief in civil rights, was also willing to work with even the most virulent segregationist senators. And perhaps the most controversial speech he has given was his eulogy for Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. 

“At least there was some civility,” Mr. Biden said at a fund-raiser in June 2019, citing James O. Eastland of Mississippi and Herman E. Talmadge of Georgia. “We didn’t agree on much of anything. We got things done.”

Under fire, Mr. Biden ultimately expressed regret for the way he invoked segregationist former colleagues.

He did not apologize for the instinct.

The stature Mr. Biden gained in the Senate did not always translate on the presidential campaign trail.

His 1988 race ended in humiliation amid a plagiarism controversy.

In 2008, Mr. Biden struggled to stand out in a talented and crowded field that included Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. He dropped out after Iowa, after cementing his reputation for verbal gaffes by referring to Mr. Obama as “articulate and bright and clean.”

But as Mr. Obama’s vice president, Mr. Biden was in many ways back in his element.

“Every time we had a trouble in the administration, who got sent to the Hill to settle it? Me,” Mr. Biden said at that 2019 fund-raiser. “Because I demonstrate respect for them.”

Sometimes that approach got him results — he helped secure three Republican votes for the economic stimulus bill in 2009, for example.

On other occasions — including a major gun control effort after the school shooting in Newtown, Conn. — it ultimately did not.

Mr. Biden, like many of his fellow Democrats, was enraged by the Trump presidency and fearful about the corrosive effects of four more years of extraordinary divisiveness.

But he was also closely attuned to moderate, older Black primary voters and had carefully followed which Democrats won in the toughest districts in the 2018 midterm elections. As Mr. Biden mulled a third presidential bid, he was skeptical of tacking far to the left in response to Mr. Trump and his Republican allies. And he was convinced, based on his own experiences, that he could help find common ground.

“Through very difficult periods in the country’s history, he believes he has been able to bring people together,” said Mike Donilon, Mr. Biden’s chief strategist, citing the 2009 stimulus bill and his efforts on a sweeping health measure at the end of 2016. “Beyond the politics, there are also just fundamental judgments about how to treat people, how to talk to them.”

Throughout his campaign, Mr. Biden has championed that approach, sometimes with a touch of performative defensiveness.

“We need to revive the spirit of bipartisanship in this country,” he said in a speech in Gettysburg, Pa., last month. “I’m accused of being naïve. I’m told, ‘Maybe that’s the way things used to work, Joe, but they can’t work that way anymore.’”

“They can and they must if we’re going to get anything done,” he said.

Mr. Biden, of course, has a policy agenda too, one that he has addressed often in recent months.

He ran on a platform of expanding health care access through a public option, and promoting the middle class. He promised to tackle climate change and to combat racial injustice, acknowledging that America has “never lived up” to the promise that all Americans are created equal. After the pandemic hit, he grew increasingly open to more ambitious social and economic proposals.

But more than anything, he ran as himself, with all of the convictions and the flaws he has displayed over a half-century in public life.

There were the exaggerations and verbal blunders and the flashes of temper. He lost the first three contests, and his campaign was practically moribund when Black voters in South Carolina, who saw him as a familiar and reassuring figure in troubled times, rescued his bid.

“We know Joe,” Mr. Clyburn said as he endorsed Mr. Biden. “But most importantly, Joe knows us.”

And through those peaks and valleys, Mr. Biden hewed to one consistent message: that the turmoil of the Trump era was an existential threat to the character of the country — and that he was uniquely equipped to lower the nation’s temperature and try to bring the country together.

“Has the heart of this nation turned to stone?” Mr. Biden said recently, speaking in Warm Springs, Ga. “I refuse to believe it. I know this country. I know our people. And I know we can unite and heal this nation.”

In some ways, it is a promise he has been preparing to make for his whole career.

This time around, a majority of American voters decided to believe him."
Why Arizona’s Storied Conservative Stronghold Could Flip for Biden,"PHOENIX — Ten years ago, Maricopa County was the place that spawned the political careers of Republican hard-liners like Joe Arpaio, the sheriff who demonized immigrants and placed inmates in a tent camp. Politicians from Phoenix and its suburbs thrived with appeals to voters on guns, religion and taxes.

But these days, the county’s scorching growth has produced a battleground in which Republicans suddenly find themselves on the defensive. The children of the immigrants targeted by Mr. Arpaio, as well as an influx of outsiders from places like California, are reshaping the political landscape of this part of the West.

As Arizona now stands to become a coveted prize for Democrats, Maricopa County is undergoing what may amount to one of the biggest political shifts of any major county in the United States in recent years. The last time Maricopa County came this close to siding with a Democratic presidential candidate was in 1948.

“We think of John Wayne and the Sonoran Desert when we have visions of Arizona, but the truth is we’re an urban state where the Phoenix metro area is the heart and soul of Arizona at this point,” said Joseph Garcia, executive director of Chicanos Por La Causa Action Fund, a Phoenix group that helped register and turn out thousands of Latino voters for Joseph R. Biden Jr.

There is now a considerable list of elected positions in the county that are held by Democrats, including county recorder and sheriff — all in the place where the five-term Republican senator Barry Goldwater led the resurgence of the American conservative movement in the 1960s and ’70s.

Various factors have contributed to the political reconfiguration, originating with the backlash — including from powerful Republicans in the Phoenix business establishment — against Arizona’s immigration crackdown in 2010. The changes began to take shape clearly by 2016, when Mr. Arpaio was defeated and Hillary Clinton lost the county by just three percentage points.

They accelerated in 2018 with Kyrsten Sinema’s flip of a Senate seat into Democratic hands. And they turned into a potential game-changer this week, as the county appeared to be providing a crucial boost to Mr. Biden’s bid for the presidency and Mark Kelly’s flip of yet another Senate seat held by Republicans.

Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. led President Trump by about three percentage points in Maricopa County as of Friday afternoon — in a county that Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee for president in 2012, won by 12 percentage points.

“Right now, Maricopa is tangibly, unabashedly, demonstrably a Democratic county, something I never thought I would see in my lifetime,” said Stan Barnes, 59, a longtime Republican strategist in Phoenix. “It just blows my mind.”

Even as Maricopa County’s individualistic gunslinging reputation is giving way to calls for change from its increasingly diverse electorate, it remains — like much of the country — sharply divided along political fault lines. The county’s Republicans maintain immense sway in Arizona’s state politics. Some of Mr. Trump’s most fervent supporters live in Maricopa County, reflected in the armed protesters who have been positioning themselves this week in front of the County Recorder’s voting tabulation site.

Accounting for about 60 percent of Arizona’s population with nearly 4.5 million people, Maricopa County ranks among the fastest-growing counties in the United States. The influx of more voters from other states, many of them relatively moderate or liberal, has produced some of this growth.

But the county has also provided one of the most important venues for the ascendancy of Latino voters and elected officials in recent years, following the rapid growth of its Latino population since the start of the century, from about 365,000 in 2000 to more than 1.3 million in 2020.

While Latinos in Florida got much of the nation’s attention this week for trying to help Mr. Trump win that state, efforts to boost voting for Democrats by Arizona’s Latinos got relatively little notice — and negligible help from the national Democratic Party, Mr. Garcia said.

“All the attention for whatever reason goes to Miami-Dade County as if that is the center of the universe for Latinos,” he said. Referring to the national party, he added, “We didn’t get any help from them, but for us the Latino vote was too important and we weren’t going to wait around.”

The shift from the old days seems jarring even to some of the Democrats involved in making it happen.

Adrian Fontes, a former trial lawyer and Marine, became the first Latino elected to countywide office in Maricopa County in 2016.

“I never thought I would get elected, period,” said Mr. Fontes, who now oversees elections as the county recorder after defeating a Republican incumbent who had held the seat since 1988. “I did not anticipate because of my lack of political savvy that Maricopa County would be the most important county in the most important presidential race in recent history,” he said in a recent interview.

As votes in the county are counted this week, pro-Trump protesters, some of them armed with military-style rifles, have unsuccessfully demanded to be allowed in the building where the tabulation is taking place. The crowds have at times been chanting for Mr. Fontes to be recalled.

Since he is also running for re-election, Mr. Fontes is staying away from both the tabulation center and his own recorder’s complex to avoid the appearance of any impropriety during the vote count. He is leading his Republican opponent in the race.

“It’s the deliciousness of irony that not one of these people voted for me and we all want the exact same thing from this election: We want every valid vote counted,” he said of the protests.

Many Democrats trace the changes that made them competitive in Maricopa County to the spate of anti-immigrant laws a decade ago that helped galvanize Latino youth in Arizona. A decade later, they have given rise to a generation of activists and elected officials.

Raquel Terán, a Democratic state legislator who represents a district that encompasses parts of Phoenix and Glendale, began her political career as a field organizer fighting against anti-immigrant legislation and for workers’ rights.

In 2012, she ran for office and lost by just 113 votes before resuming work as an organizer. Eventually, she became the state director for Mi Familia Vota, a national group that helps Latinos become citizens and register to vote. She decided to enter the race again in 2018, and won. This year she ran unopposed for a second term.

“Through the years, we have been building political power,” Ms. Terán said. “And 2020 shows our work is paying off.”

Another activist, Anabel Maldonado, was in high school when Arizona enacted legislation in 2010 that empowered the police to stop and question anyone they suspected of being in the country illegally, targeting undocumented immigrants in a state that had become a laboratory for such measures.

Mr. Arpaio, the former sheriff, enforced the law, known as SB1070, by deploying his deputies across Maricopa County to conduct arrests and workplace raids.

“Just being Latino in the state gave us a lot of anxiety,” said Ms. Maldonado, 29. “You’d say goodbye to your parents in the morning and not know if they would be caught up in a raid.”

Instead of leaving the state, she said, many young Latinos were energized. “It turned into a moment for folks to stand up, fight back and move past the fear to do something about it,” she said.

A decade later, Ms. Maldonado, the daughter of a janitor and a teacher’s aide who immigrated to Phoenix from Mexico, is among the many children of immigrants who have built a grass-roots movement that has educated and mobilized hundreds of thousands of Latino voters.



Hundreds of volunteers worked during the recent election campaign, braving 110-degree heat in face shields to engage Latinos in a “Basta Trump” (“Enough of Trump”) campaign. Others made phone calls and sent texts.

“We were helping people focus on our struggles, access to education, health care and jobs,” said Eduardo Sainz, state director of Mi Familia Vota.

In addition to mobilizing Democratic votes in the presidential race, the effort led to the passage of a proposition on this year’s ballot to bolster funding for public schools by hundreds of millions of dollars each year by imposing a tax on the top 4 percent of wage earners in Arizona.

"As Biden takes the lead in Georgia, state officials say a recount is inevitable.","ATLANTA — As former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. took a narrow lead over President Trump in Georgia, Georgia’s secretary of state said Friday that the presidential race there was so close that a recount was inevitable.

By early Saturday morning, Mr. Biden led Mr. Trump in Georgia by about more than 7,000 votes.

“With a margin that small, there will be a recount in Georgia,” the secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, said Friday morning at the state Capitol.

He added: “The final tally in Georgia at this point has huge implications for the entire country. The stakes are high and emotions are high on all sides. We will not let those debates distract us from our work. We will get it right, and we will defend the integrity of our elections.”

Gabriel Sterling, an official with the secretary of state’s office, said that a pool of about 4,200 ballots — most of them absentee ballots — remained to be tallied in four counties: Gwinnett, Cobb, Cherokee and Floyd. The largest tranche to be counted was in Gwinnett County, which contains Atlanta suburban communities and has gone from leaning Republican to leaning Democratic in recent years.

The state must also deal with ballots from military and overseas voters, which will be counted if they arrive in the mail before the end of business Friday and were postmarked by Tuesday.

Mr. Sterling said that the unofficial tally of the votes could be completed by the end of the weekend.

Flipping Georgia, a state last won by a Democrat in 1992, and where Mr. Trump won by more than 200,000 votes four years ago, would represent a significant political shift this year, but the state has shown signs of trending blue. When Mr. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016, he did so by five percentage points, a far slimmer margin than Republicans had enjoyed in previous presidential elections.

Mr. Biden’s late surge in this year’s count, thanks to his dominance in Atlanta, Savannah and the increasingly Democratic-friendly suburbs around both, transformed the competition in a traditionally Republican-leaning state into one of the closest contests in the nation.

As the count narrowed and it appeared that the two candidates would be separated by the slimmest of margins, Democrats urged voters in the state to fix ballots that had been rejected because of invalid or missing signatures before the deadline on Friday evening.

Those who voted absentee — a group that this year has been heavily Democratic — could check online to see whether election officials had accepted or rejected their ballots. Absentee ballots are often rejected when the voter forgets to sign or uses a signature that does not match the one on file with the state, in some cases because the filed signature is many years old. Election officials are supposed to contact voters in such cases but are not always able to do so.

Voters had until 5 p.m. on Friday to submit an affidavit form to “cure” such ballots. With Georgia hanging in the balance as the last votes were counted, national Democrats — including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York — were amplifying the message in hopes of salvaging every vote possible."
Where the Election Fight Is Playing Out in the Courts,"[Read more on Joe Biden’s president-elect acceptance speech.]

With Joseph R. Biden Jr. edging closer to victory in the presidential race, President Trump and the Republican Party have been intensifying efforts to halt the counting of ballots and to challenge the ballots of Democratic voters in lawsuits across the country.

Nearly a dozen suits were already making their way through the courts in Nevada, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia, four key states where Mr. Biden leads or has won the vote count.

But none of them appear — at least not yet — to provide Mr. Trump what he would need to prevail: the rejection of enough Democratic ballots in enough states to reverse any Biden victory.

If Mr. Trump and the Republicans cannot find those rejections through the courts, they could — and will — try to do so through recounts, but the bar is high there too.

Here are the cases currently underway or facing a potential appeal. All of them have been initiated by Mr. Trump, his party or his allies.

Status: At the U.S. Supreme Court

In September, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that election officials could accept ballots postmarked by Election Day but arriving up to three days later. Republicans subsequently sued, and the case made it to the U.S. Supreme Court.

But in late October, the Supreme Court declined to intercede, saying it was too close to Election Day to make such a ruling, but it left open the possibility of a decision at a later date.

On Wednesday, the Trump campaign filed a motion to intervene in the case, and on Friday the Pennsylvania Republican Party sought to join the effort.

But this fight may prove fruitless, as Mr. Biden’s lead in the state is based on ballots cast by Election Day and is expected to grow. Pennsylvania’s secretary of state, Kathy Boockvar, said on Thursday that there were not large numbers of late-arriving ballots. As of Friday night, there had been no further action on this case.

Status: Pending in state court and resolved in federal court

On Thursday morning, a Pennsylvania state court handed Mr. Trump a minor victory. A judge ruled that election observers from the Trump campaign, who were allowed to stand 10 feet from the vote counting at the Philadelphia convention center, could move closer, to six feet.

By the end of the day, however, lawyers for the Trump campaign had filed an emergency petition in federal court claiming that election officials in the city were not abiding by the state court’s decision and asking that the count in Philadelphia be delayed.

At a hastily scheduled hearing Thursday night, however, Mr. Trump’s campaign admitted that “a nonzero number” of Republican observers had in fact turned up.

“Then what’s the problem?” Judge Paul S. Diamond asked.

The Trump campaign ultimately agreed to drop its request to halt the vote count after Judge Diamond, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, allowed for a total of 120 observers at the convention center — 60 for the Democrats and 60 for the Republicans. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the question of the observers.

Status: Pending in state and federal courts

Republicans have brought suits in federal and state courts alleging that Ms. Boockvar provided improper guidance to counties by allowing them to contact voters whose mail ballots had been rejected because of errors so that those voters could fix, or “cure,” their ballots or cast provisional ballots.

Both cases focus on votes in Montgomery County, where officials say only 98 ballots might be affected.

.A judge in the federal case, who is also a George W. Bush appointee, expressed skepticism during a hearing on Wednesday about the validity of the Republicans’ challenge. A decision is pending.

Status: Pending in state court

The Trump campaign has also sued Ms. Boockvar for her decision to extend by three days, to Nov. 12, the deadline by which mail-in voters must submit materials confirming their identity if they are first-time voters in certain districts. It is unclear how many votes that case would potentially affect.

Status: Pending appeal at state level

Mr. Trump’s campaign filed suit before Election Day seeking to stop the processing of mail-in ballots in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas. The campaign alleged that county officials were failing to give Republican observers adequate access to monitor mail-in ballot processing and that the county’s signature matching system violated election equal protection laws because it was not being used elsewhere in the state.

A judge denied the Trump campaign’s request earlier this week, citing a lack of evidence. An appellate court rejected Republicans’ request that it order an immediate stop to counting but agreed to hear arguments into next week.

On Thursday, Republicans indicated that they would drop their case in return for an agreement from the county to expand their observers’ access to ballot counters, but Democrats refused to agree to a dismissal, so the case is still pending. Republicans have since filed a similar suit in federal court.

Status: Resolved in federal court

In an effective extension of the state lawsuit, two Republican House candidates in Nevada filed a lawsuit on Thursday alleging that there were “lax procedures for authenticating ballots” in Clark County and that more than 3,000 ballots had been cast by inelligible voters, including some cast “on behalf of deceased voters.”

The case was assigned to Judge Andrew P. Gordon, an appointee of President Barack Obama’s, who dismissed it on Friday. The two Republican candidates who brought the case, however, can still appeal the decision.

Status: Pending in state court

It was one of the stranger claims of the election. Hours after polls closed in Arizona, a story ricocheted around online saying that dozens, maybe even hundreds, of ballots across the state had not been counted because voters had filled them out with felt-tipped Sharpies and not with ballpoint pens.

Even though cybersecurity officials from the Department of Homeland Security urged people to ignore the tale, crowds turned up outside of a polling station in Maricopa County, yelling about “SharpieGate.”

On Wednesday, Laurie Aguilera, a Maricopa County voter, filed a lawsuit with help from a conservative legal group in Indiana, the Public Interest Legal Foundation, claiming that her ballot — and those of untold others — had not been read properly by vote scanning machines because she had used a Sharpie and “the ink was bleeding through.” Ms. Aguilera has asked a judge to let all voters who filled their ballots out with Sharpies to “cure” them.

On Thursday, the Maricopa County Elections Department released a statement saying that Sharpies were in fact “recommended by the manufacturer” of the vote tabulations machines the county uses. Later that day, the state attorney general’s office issued a letter noting that the use of Sharpies in Maricopa County “did not result in disenfranchisement.”

Status: Tossed by county court

The Trump campaign filed a lawsuit in Georgia on Wednesday, claiming that a witness had observed 53 late-arriving ballots in Chatham County not being properly stored, potentially allowing for them to mix with timely ballots, and asked that ballot counting in the county be stopped.

But Judge James Bass, on the Chatham County Superior Court, tossed the lawsuit on Thursday, saying that there was no evidence that those 53 ballots had been received after the 7 p.m. deadline and that there was no evidence county officials had failed to comply with the law.

There was no word from the Trump campaign or its Republican allies on Friday whether an appeal was pending.

The Trump campaign filed suit on Wednesday asking a state judge to halt vote counting, alleging that its observers had been blocked from meaningful access to counting rooms. The campaign also asked for access to surveillance footage of the state’s ballot drop boxes.

A judge rejected that suit on Thursday, noting that the counting had finished. Mr. Biden won the state and maintains a lead of nearly 150,000 votes. But it is not clear whether the Trump campaign will appeal.

Georgia: Brad Raffensperger, the secretary of state, announced on Friday that the state would conduct a recount in the presidential race, saying the results would fall within the margin of a recount. “We are literally looking at a margin of less than a large high school,” Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s voting implementation manager, said.

Wisconsin: Mr. Trump would be entitled to a recount in Wisconsin as long as the margin between him and Mr. Biden remained less than 1 percent of the vote. The state’s preliminary results show Mr. Trump trailing by about six-tenths of 1 percent.

A recount request cannot be made until all 72 of the state’s counties submit their results to the Wisconsin Elections Commission, which are due by Nov. 17. The Trump campaign would have to pay for a statewide recount unless the margin shrinks to less than one-quarter of 1 percent. 

Pennsylvania: State law requires an automatic recount if the result is half a percent or less. If the margin is larger than that, Mr. Trump could still request a statewide recount, but he would have to pay for it.

Arizona: State law requires a recount if the margin is one-tenth of one percent or less — otherwise one cannot be requested.

Nevada: Any candidate or campaign can request a recount within three days of the final statewide canvass of results, regardless of the margin. There are no automatic state recounts."
"As Biden Inches Ahead in Georgia, Stacey Abrams Draws Recognition and Praise","Stacey Abrams, who earlier this year was on a short list of potential vice-presidential candidates, was ultimately not chosen by Joseph R. Biden Jr. But on Friday, as Mr. Biden took a narrow lead in Georgia, it was Ms. Abrams who was celebrated, a sign of her remarkable ascent as a power broker since her failed bid for governor of that state two years ago.

Celebrities, activists and voters across Georgia credited Ms. Abrams with moving past her loss — she came within 55,000 votes of the governor’s mansion — and building a well-funded network of organizations that highlighted voter suppression in the state and inspired an estimated 800,000 residents to register to vote.

“You have to build the infrastructure to organize and motivate your base, and you have to persuade people,” said Jason Carter, a Democrat who was the party’s candidate for governor in 2014. “Stacey built that infrastructure, and Donald Trump’s presidency energized that infrastructure, and it opened up voters to persuasion who were previously not open, particularly in the suburbs.”

Mr. Biden pulled ahead of President Trump in Georgia, a state that has not elected a Democratic presidential candidate in nearly three decades, and maintained a slight lead throughout Friday. He was up about 4,100 votes Friday evening with more than 98 percent of the ballots counted. Because of the small margin, the secretary of state confirmed there would be a recount.

Still, Democrats in the state were jubilant.

State Senator Jen Jordan, a Democrat, said Ms. Abrams had built upon her loss by recognizing Georgia’s population growth, and its increasingly diverse demographic, as an opening for Democrats.

“She saw it coming,” Ms. Jordan said in an interview Friday. “The data was there if you wanted to look at it. The problem was nobody was really willing to look at the data.”

By bringing attention to the possibilities in Georgia, Ms. Jordan continued, Ms. Abrams attracted money to the state and used it to boost Democratic politicians. The organization has also distributed money to other state Democratic parties, particularly in the South.

Donors to her organizations have included labor unions and former New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.

“She really put the spotlight on Georgia, convinced the people that needed to be convinced that there was room here, that there were voters here, and that this place really was competitive if people would just put in the time, the money and the effort in to do that,” Ms. Jordan said.

Ms. Abrams fought hard in 2018, and when she lost, she refused to concede. Her opponent, Brian Kemp, was then serving as Georgia’s secretary of state, the top election officer, and had spent years aggressively purging the state’s voter rolls and battling civil rights groups over ballot access. Mistrust lingers over that race.

“I, for one, feel she would be our governor if it were not for the rampant voter suppression tactics,” said Nikema Williams, the state’s Democratic Party chair who on Tuesday emerged as the victor to succeed John Lewis in the U.S. Congress. “The work that she did in organizing people on the ground, in coalition with other progressive organizations, was critical to building the infrastructure in this state.”

Ms. Abrams declined to comment on Friday. But in a tweet, she wrote, “My heart is full.” And she cited the work of other activists. “Georgia, let’s shout out those who’ve been in the trenches and deserve the plaudits for change.”

If Mr. Biden holds onto his slim lead in Georgia, her profile is likely to grow.

Mr. Carter, the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter who lost by eight percentage points, said Democrats had “hit a partisan ceiling” in the state. But “since 2014, Stacey’s effort, and others, have raised that partisan ceiling” by broadening appeal to younger voters, people of color and suburban residents.

After her loss in 2018, Ms. Abrams described that election as nonetheless a victory of sorts, as she had garnered more votes than any Democrat in Georgia history. Still, she acknowledged the pain, telling an interviewer that she “sat shiva” for 10 days, a reference to the Jewish mourning ritual.

Then she moved on to building a network of organizations that has become a well-funded juggernaut for voting rights and economic advancement. While some on the right have criticized her as a divisive figure, and her growing profile is not uniformly welcomed in the state’s Black political circles, there is general agreement that she has driven voters, particularly Black voters, to the polls.

In addition to fund-raising for a voter-protection initiative, Ms. Abrams’s organization has assisted Democratic state legislative candidates, whose campaigns have long been in legislative districts drawn by Republicans.

Ms. Abrams, a former minority leader of the Georgia House, founded the New Georgia Project while she was still in the state legislature. The nonprofit registered about 100,000 new voters. She then founded Fair Fight Action, an organization geared at combating voter suppression.

Since then, her network, headquartered in Atlanta, has grown into a varied network, including Fair Fight PAC, a SuperPAC that collected more than $33 million this election cycle. There’s also Fair Count, which promotes the census, and the Southern Economic Advancement Project, an organization whose mission is broadening economic power and building a more equitable future for underserved communities.

It is a mission deeply personal to Ms. Abrams, whose parents met in high school in Hattiesburg, Miss., and studied at Tougaloo College, a historically Black school near Jackson, Miss., before becoming Methodist clergy members. Ms. Abrams, 46, holds a law degree from Yale and worked as a tax lawyer before entering politics. She also has an affinity for Star Trek.

Her organization’s work against voter suppression was made more urgent by her defeat two years ago, and her allegations that suppression had played a role. Since then, Fair Fight has been a lead plaintiff in a federal lawsuit against the Georgia secretary of state in an effort to broaden access to voting. The suit takes aim at the state’s voter purges, its use of exact signature matching, and how it handles provisional ballots and its closing or relocation of polling sites.

Last year, Georgia reinstated 22,000 voters it had purged amid legal pressure from the group.

“This litigation has functioned as a significant point of pressure for the secretary of state and the state Board of Elections to make sure that Georgia’s election system is functioning the way that it should be,” said Jonathan Diaz, legal counsel for voting rights at the Campaign Legal Center, which is representing Fair Fight in the case.

Not everyone is celebrating Ms. Abrams. Lee Morris, a Republican who serves as county commissioner in Fulton County, home to Atlanta, said he viewed Ms. Abrams, a fiery orator, as “divisive,” drawing a comparison between her and Mr. Trump.

“Like President Trump’s allegations of cheating and corruption have fired up the right side, certainly her efforts have fired up the enthusiasm of folks to get out and vote,” Mr. Morris said in an interview Friday. That said, while Mr. Trump’s false claims of rigged elections and widespread cheating are baseless, Georgia has a long and documented history of voter suppression, particularly among voters of color.

Ms. Abrams has, at times, also run afoul of members of her own party, who criticized her blunt ambition and open desire to be Mr. Biden’s running mate. In the South, where Black politicians are close-knit and traditional, Ms. Abrams has also been a disruptive force. Her political vision can be at odds with the local Democratic establishment, and her shot to national prominence has ruffled feathers.

The political payoff of Mr. Biden’s breakthrough in Georgia, however, may put those tensions to rest. The playbook she popularized took root — a combination of winning back metro suburbanites and registering new voters in Black, Latino, and Asian-American communities.

Nse Ufot, the current chief executive of New Georgia Project, said electoral campaigns are often too shortsighted to do the long-term work of registering and educating new voters, regardless of party affiliation.

“When you think about the transactional nature of electoral campaigns, I think they prioritize getting people who are already voters to vote for them,” Ms. Ufot said, adding that there was “not enough conversation about 100 million Americans who are eligible to vote who did not vote in 2016.”

"Biden’s Team Steps Up Transition Plans, Mapping Out a White House","Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s advisers accelerated their transition planning on Friday as election results showed him with an advantage in battleground states that could hand him the presidency, with the first senior officials in a potential Biden White House possibly named as early as next week.

In Wilmington and Washington, Mr. Biden’s advisers and allies are ramping up their conversations about who might fill critical posts, both in the West Wing and across the agencies, guided heavily by Mr. Biden’s plan to assemble what would be the most diverse cabinet in history.

The behind-the-scenes activity underscored that even as Mr. Biden publicly offered a disciplined message about counting every vote and refrained from claiming victory, he was already mapping out a quick start in office as the nation faces a worsening pandemic and a damaged economy.

Mr. Biden, who ran from Day 1 on a message of bringing the country together, is said to be interested in making a bipartisan gesture as he plans a prospective government after a divisive election whose results President Trump has tried to undermine. Mr. Biden is looking to fill out his possible White House staff first, with cabinet posts not expected to be announced until around Thanksgiving, according to more than a half-dozen people familiar with the planning process who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the transition.

Mr. Biden’s team quietly began raising money for his transition operation in May and has raised at least $7 million to pay for its efforts. The Biden camp has prepared for multiple scenarios in case Mr. Trump refused to concede and his administration would not participate in a transition.

So far, officials in Mr. Trump’s government have worked in good faith, according to Biden officials, who said they hoped and expected that cooperation to continue.

As coronavirus infections hit new highs, Mr. Biden’s aides are planning for the first critical transition decisions to focus on health care and addressing the pandemic, the central theme of his campaign in the final months. They have assembled an internal group of roughly two dozen health policy and technology experts to look at the development and delivery of a vaccine, improving health data and securing supply chains, among other issues.

“We’re not waiting to get the work done,” Mr. Biden said in a speech on Friday night.

Among those expected to play a key health care role in a Biden administration is Vivek Murthy, a former surgeon general under President Barack Obama, who has privately advised Mr. Biden for months on the pandemic and is expected to play a large public role as a face of the potential Democratic administration’s response to the virus, dispensing advice on mask-wearing and social distancing.

Transition officials are also looking at what types of economic actions could be taken almost immediately, including rolling back some of Mr. Trump’s executive orders, part of a tradition in which new presidents move quickly to change or reverse regulations across federal agencies.

Mr. Biden, 77, has told associates that he considers his two terms as vice president and his knowledge of how a White House operates from the inside as crucial advantages in building out a government. And he has made it plain in public and private that a diverse team is central to his mission.

“Men, women, gay, straight, center, across the board, Black, white, Asian,” Mr. Biden said this spring when talking about his prospective cabinet. “It really matters that you look like the country, because everyone brings a slightly different perspective.”

Though Mr. Biden and Democrats had aggressively pushed to take control of the Senate, the party fell short in hotly contested races this week. Now Senate Republicans are likely to hold veto power over his most senior appointments, a reality that looms large over conversations, even if Democrats could still conceivably control the Senate if they win two runoff elections in Georgia in January.

Even before it was clear that Democrats would not win a clear majority in the Senate, Mr. Biden’s advisers began gearing up for bruising cabinet confirmation battles, bringing in top Obama veterans to run what is informally being called a transition war room. 

If Mr. Biden wins, he is expected to initially focus on filling top posts at the White House, including chief of staff, the most powerful single staff position. Ron Klain, his former chief of staff as vice president, who served as the White House Ebola response coordinator under Mr. Obama, is seen to have the inside track for that job, though others are still reportedly under serious consideration.

At the center of Mr. Biden’s transition planning is Ted Kaufman, his former chief of staff in the Senate, who was appointed to replace Mr. Biden as a senator after he became vice president, as well as Jeff Zients, a former Obama administration official.

Like Mr. Biden, Mr. Kaufman is seen as an institutionalist, and he in fact wrote the law devoting additional government resources to transition teams. Yohannes Abraham, who worked in the Obama White House as a top aide to Valerie Jarrett and the National Economic Council, is overseeing the day-to-day operation.

Given his decades-long career in Washington, Mr. Biden has numerous relationships from his time in the Senate and the White House with people across various policy areas. That history also means that his transition team has faced a crush of outside advice and former Biden associates jockeying for jobs and influence.

Parts of the cast that had Mr. Biden’s ear throughout the presidential campaign — Anita Dunn, a senior adviser; Steve Ricchetti, another former vice-presidential chief of staff; and Mr. Klain — are among those guiding the formation of a would-be government. Senator Kamala Harris of California, his running mate, is generating names and speaks regularly to Mr. Biden. In Mr. Biden’s policy orbit on the campaign, Jake Sullivan and Antony J. Blinken are widely seen as the most influential figures, and both are expected to hold senior posts in a potential administration.

Where they land is considered one of the early decisions that would help determine other appointments. Mr. Sullivan, a former adviser to Hillary Clinton, is lined up for one of a number of posts, while Mr. Blinken, who served as national security adviser to the vice president, is considered the leading candidate for national security adviser.

Some of the most powerful cabinet positions in a possible Biden administration already have perceived front-runners.

The top candidate to lead the Defense Department is Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defense for policy who worked with Biden officials during the campaign. She would be the first woman ever to be appointed to the job.

Lael Brainard, who sits on the Federal Reserve’s board of governors and served in the Treasury Department under Mr. Obama, is the most talked-about candidate to run the department, especially if the Senate is controlled by Republicans, which would make it harder to confirm a more progressive choice like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

Susan Rice, a former national security adviser during the Obama administration whom Mr. Biden vetted for vice president, has been considered a leading choice for secretary of state, but the threat of Senate Republicans blocking her from becoming the nation’s chief diplomat in 2012 led to her withdrawal, and her nomination now would surely set off a fight.

Mr. Blinken, a former deputy secretary of state, has been discussed among Biden allies as a possible choice, along with Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a top Biden supporter who in October wrote an article in Foreign Affairs magazine on his worldviews.

Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, one of Mr. Biden’s campaign co-chairs and an adviser, is widely expected to take some role in the White House if the Democratic nominee wins. Another campaign co-chair, Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, who also served on Mr. Biden’s search committee for vice president, could join a prospective administration, though it was not clear what post might lure him to Washington.

Leaders of the Biden transition are aware that many civil servants throughout the federal bureaucracy have become demoralized and have felt marginalized during the Trump administration. In a small gesture, they are calling their potential first arrivals at agencies “agency review teams,” as opposed to what the Trump operation called “landing teams” in 2016.

Already hanging over the discussions are the midterm elections, in 2022, which have traditionally been a struggle for whichever party holds the White House and which could be especially complicated for Democrats during an era of increasingly common progressive primary challenges.

Some Democratic House members who endorsed Mr. Biden early, such as Representative Filemon B. Vela Jr. of Texas and Representative Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, could be in line for administration positions if they wanted them.

“We have an expression where I come from: You never forget those who brung you to the dance,” Mr. Biden said at a stop with Mr. Boyle in Philadelphia this week.

The Biden operation is preparing for Mr. Trump to potentially put up transition roadblocks. The transition team has already assembled a staff of more than 75 officials, with plans for that number to balloon to roughly 300 transition staff members by Inauguration Day in January. The administrator for the General Services Administration has the legal authority to release about $6.6 million in federal funding to Mr. Biden’s transition, and in past years has done that soon after the race is called.

Pamela Pennington, a spokeswoman for the G.S.A., said in a statement that Emily W. Murphy, Mr. Trump’s appointee as the agency’s administrator, would start the official transition when it was clear that the race was over.

“The G.S.A. administrator does not pick the winner in the presidential election,” Ms. Pennington said. “The G.S.A. administrator ascertains the apparent successful candidate once a winner is clear based on the process laid out in the Constitution.”

"With No Evidence of Fraud, Trump Fails to Make Headway on Legal Cases","President Trump’s bellicose pledge to fight the outcome of the election in the courts crashed on Friday into skeptical judges, daunting Electoral College math and a lack of evidence for his claims of fraud.

On a day that began with vote tallies in Georgia and Pennsylvania tipping in Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s favor, Mr. Trump’s campaign declared, “This election is not over,” as the Republican National Committee announced it had activated “legal challenge teams” in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania. And the Trump forces named a new general to lead the effort, the hardened conservative political combatant David Bossie.

But none of the dozen or so lawsuits they had brought in battleground states appeared to be gaining any traction in the courts. And in any case, none seemed likely to give Mr. Trump the edge he would need in vote counts in the states that will determine the outcome.

In seeking to foment widespread doubt about the legitimacy of the election, Mr. Trump and his surrogates seemed less focused on substantive legal arguments that could hold up in court than on bolstering the president’s political narrative, unsupported by the facts, that he was somehow being robbed of a second term.

The most high-profile step of the day came when Pennsylvania Republicans asked the U.S. Supreme Court to step in and require election officials in the state to segregate ballots that arrived after Election Day and not to include them for now in the vote totals in the largest and most critical of the swing states.

On Friday evening, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. agreed to the request. 

But the move was almost entirely for show: Pennsylvania is already segregating those ballots, counting them separately and not including them in the announced vote totals. The secretary of state, over the objections of Republicans and Mr. Trump, has said they can be counted if they arrived by 5 p.m. on Friday, in line with a state court ruling that the Supreme Court has left open the possibility of reviewing again. 

A state official said the ballots in question number in the thousands but not tens of thousands. 

Their lack of progress in stopping the count or making a persuasive case for large-scale ballot fraud left Mr. Trump and his team increasingly reliant for political salvation on recounts — which appeared likely to take place in Georgia, Nevada, Arizona and Wisconsin but which rarely result in big swings in vote counts.

The Trump effort may be getting a boost from state legislatures in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which are both controlled by Republicans. In Wisconsin, Robin Vos, the speaker of the State Assembly, directed a legislative committee to “use its investigatory powers” to conduct a review of the election, again raising the specter of voter fraud without offering specific evidence.

In Pennsylvania, the two top Republicans in the legislature called on Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, to conduct “an immediate audit” of the election.

At the same time, allies of the president openly suggested an extreme move: to use baseless allegations of Democratic malfeasance to pressure Republican-controlled state legislatures in key states to send pro-Trump electors to the Electoral College regardless of the results of the popular vote.

Officials with the Biden campaign said they would meet every legal challenge Mr. Trump brought but said they were confident that none of the cases they had seen so far seemed likely to loosen Mr. Biden’s tightening grasp on the presidency.

“The Republican legal claims are utterly baseless and have failed and will continue to fail in the courts,’’ said Bob Bauer, a senior adviser to the Biden campaign. “They serve no purpose other than to echo Donald Trump’s discredited and shameful attack on the democratic process.”

In a statement, the Republican Party’s chief counsel, Justin Riemer, said, “We are focused on protecting the integrity of the vote and ensuring all legally cast ballots are counted,” but he was not made available for further comment on the particulars of the party’s legal strategy.

The intensive Trump effort was the endgame of a long-planned contingency in which the president planned to challenge any possible loss through claims that the voting system was “rigged” against him. The campaign has been abetted by a robust pro-Trump media ecosystem, with Mr. Trump’s own social media accounts at its center, amplifying his false claims.

As the legal push has failed to make substantial headway this week it has taken on an urgent, at times desperate, tone.

On Thursday, Eric Trump, one of the president’s sons, said on Twitter, “I truly hope the @FBI/@DOJ engages immediately.”

The former Republican Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, echoed the president’s son on Fox News, calling for the jailing of poll workers and more involvement from Attorney General William P. Barr.

But in the days since the election, Mr. Barr and the Justice Department have been largely silent. After initially echoing Mr. Trump’s warnings about electoral fraud, Mr. Barr muted his statements, and Mr. Trump complained to aides about the department’s lack of action.

But a supportive outside group, True the Vote — one of the most prominent promoters of the false narrative that “voter fraud” is rampant in the United States — sought to help Mr. Trump build his cases. On Friday, it announced it had formed a $1 million “Whistleblower Defense Fund” to “incentivize” witnesses to step forward with charges of malfeasance.

No state was seeing more legal activity than Pennsylvania, where the Trump campaign and local Republicans had brought at least a half-dozen lawsuits immediately before and after Election Day.

The case that had the potential to affect the most votes was the one filed at the Supreme Court on Friday seeking an order that would force election officials in Pennsylvania to separate mailed ballots that arrived after Election Day from other mailed ballots. In its emergency application, the party acknowledged that the secretary of state’s office had already ordered election officials to do so but said it had no way to know if they had complied.

Republicans have been unsuccessfully fighting the secretary of state’s decision to allow election officials in Pennsylvania to count mail-in ballots that arrived at their offices by Friday as long as they had postmarks from Election Day or before. The Supreme Court had twice passed up opportunities to rule on the dispute, though the case is still technically pending, giving the justices the opportunity to weigh in if they saw reason to do so.

But even if the court were to take the case and rule in favor of the Republicans to wipe out all of the ballots in question — votes from mail ballots have overwhelmingly gone to Mr. Biden — it would not affect the current vote totals, which do not include the ballots that came in after Election Day. By early Friday evening, Mr. Biden had a lead of about 17,000 votes in Pennsylvania.

Other suits in Pennsylvania sought to knock out votes that were the result of a decision by Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar to allow county officials to give voters a chance to fix mistakes in their rejected mail-in ballots or to cast provisional votes instead.

A federal judge dismissed one of those cases on Friday, in Montgomery County outside Philadelphia, two days after implying during a hearing that he viewed the effort as a move to disenfranchise voters who were following state instructions.

But even if that case had succeeded, it would have affected only 93 votes. Similarly, in Michigan, a judge dismissed a Republican suit challenging the vote count in the state, noting the counting was already effectively over and dismissing some of the evidence as based on hearsay.

Frustrated supporters of the president like the talk radio host Mark Levin called on Republican legislatures in states including Pennsylvania to use their constitutional authority to send a pro-Trump delegation of electors to the Electoral College regardless of the popular vote.

Asked during a news briefing on Friday if state Republicans would do so, the majority leader of the Pennsylvania senate, Jake Corman, replied, “We want to stay in the tradition that the popular vote winner wins the election.”

Even if the state Republicans could make such a move legally — the legislature “cannot simply ignore the popular vote,” said Attorney General Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania — it was an extreme example of the lengths to which some Trump supporters seem willing to go.

In several states Mr. Trump was challenging state voting rules, effectively seeking to nullify votes cast in accordance with official guidelines.

Republicans in Nevada asked the Justice Department late Thursday to open an investigation into voter fraud involving 3,000 ballots, a move Democrats said was based on “entirely fabricated” claims.

The Justice Department declined to address the matter publicly, but its guidelines generally preclude opening criminal investigations into election-related matters until results are completed.

Local Republicans included the allegation in a suit they filed in federal court seeking a change in the way Clark County, Nev., is conducting its count. A judge dismissed the case on Friday evening, when the vote count showed a 22,000-ballot lead for Mr. Biden.

Why Is California a Blue State?,"Good morning.

While the country anxiously awaits the results from a handful of states that will determine the outcome of the presidential election, it has been known since Tuesday evening that California’s 55 electoral votes would go to Joe Biden.

[Follow the latest election updates from across the country here.]

It might come as a surprise then, that California was once considered a red state until the 1990s. From 1952 to 1988, the state gave rise to Republicans like Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. During that period, only one Democratic candidate, Lyndon B. Johnson, took the state.

This all changed in 1994, when the backlash against the passing of Proposition 187, which prohibited undocumented immigrants from accessing public services, activated a generation of Latino voters. After the proposition passed, thousands of people marched through downtown Los Angeles protesting the measure. All over the state, students organized grass-roots movements and walked out of classrooms. In 1997, Proposition 187 was ruled unconstitutional and never adopted into law.

“California Republicans embarked on an anti-immigration agenda that alienated Latino voters and drove them into the open arms of the Democratic Party,” the public opinion group Latino Decisions said in a report, calling it the “Prop 187 Effect.”

“We are a blue state because we’ve had a growing share of Latinos and Asian-Americans since the mid ’90s and after Proposition 187 they became more Democratic,” said Mindy Romero, director of the Center for Inclusive Democracy at the University of Southern California.

And the state is only getting bluer, with the number of Democrats increasing this year to 46 percent compared with 45 percent in 2016.

Likely voters are still disproportionately white. While Latinos make up 35 percent of the state’s population they make up just 21 percent of likely voters. But that makes them the second largest group of voters in the state by a large margin.

“In terms of sheer numbers, it’s Latinos,” Ms. Romero said. “California is a lock on the electoral map for Democrats and for Biden. A big part of that story is the growth of historically underrepresented populations and the growth of Latinos in particular in California.”

While Ms. Romero says it’s too early to analyze this year’s voter turnout rates, she thinks there will be an even more representative electorate this year. “In 2016, we saw the highest share of the electorate for Latinos that we’ve ever seen,” she said. “And I think we’ll see that again in 2020.”

Joe Biden received one of the highest margins in the nation in California, but a look at how the state’s ballot measures were decided shows a more complex picture of the electorate. [The New York Times]

By asking voters to repeal or overhaul laws passed by the Democratic-controlled Legislature, corporations are asking voters to overrule lawmakers in Sacramento. Already, Uber and Lyft succeeded in their campaign to pass Proposition 22. Now, tobacco companies have started a referendum drive asking voters to overturn the state’s ban on flavored cigarettes and vaping products. [CalMatters]

"Leading in Pennsylvania, Biden Tells Nation, ‘We’re Going to Win This Race’ ","

Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Friday took the lead in Pennsylvania, where a victory would give him the presidency, and was ahead in three other critical battlegrounds as his campaign focused on a presidential transition process and states worked to tally the remaining votes.

In remarks to the country from Delaware on Friday night, Mr. Biden said the trajectory of the race was clear and that he expected to win all of the uncalled states where he is currently ahead of Mr. Trump. He claimed the strength of his support reflected “a mandate for action” to counter the coronavirus pandemic and other crises.

“We’re going to win this race with a clear majority of the nation behind us,” Mr. Biden said, pointing to his apparent strength in the historically red states of Georgia and Arizona as evidence of a broad political coalition.

As Mr. Biden edged closer to victory, President Trump and his political lieutenants spent the day continuing to float baseless conspiracy theories about the legitimacy of the election, and Republicans in several states threatened or took legal action aimed at slowing or halting the counting of ballots. But there were also mounting indications that Mr. Trump would not have the full support of his party if he persisted in a scorched-earth effort to impede the electoral process.

Early on Friday, Mr. Biden overtook Mr. Trump in the vote count in both Pennsylvania and Georgia.

But in both states, as well as in Arizona and Nevada, Mr. Biden was not yet leading by a sufficiently wide margin to completely foreclose any possibility — however remote — that the count could still turn against him. On Friday evening, Mr. Biden was ahead in Pennsylvania and Georgia by less than a percentage point, and by not much more than that in the two Western states.

Should Mr. Biden win any combination of two states, or the state of Pennsylvania alone, he would clinch a majority of votes in the Electoral College.

Republican strategists and Trump allies concede that it is highly probable that Mr. Biden will cross that threshold soon enough, and that he may ultimately carry all four of the states in question. In three of them, the remaining ballots are seen as likelier to favor Mr. Biden than Mr. Trump; in the fourth, Arizona, Mr. Trump gained ground on Mr. Biden but perhaps not by a sufficient amount to erase the former vice president’s lead.

As the president continued to hurl false claims of voter fraud, he was dealt another setback Friday when the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and four other aides tested positive for the coronavirus, according to a senior administration official. Mr. Meadows, who has repeatedly mocked wearing a mask, is only the latest member of Mr. Trump’s inner circle to contract the virus.

Mr. Biden’s remarks about the state of the race on Friday night were his third in as many days since Election Day. Campaign advisers also indicated that they were ready to begin naming senior officials in an anticipated administration in a matter of days, if the race is called in his favor.

Striking an inclusive tone, Mr. Biden urged the country to set aside partisan warfare and “come together as a nation to heal.” Noting the slow pace of the vote count — “it can be numbing,” he said — he sought to reassure anxious Americans waiting for the winner of an election that has now stretched on for three days. 

“We have to remain calm, patient and let the process work out as we count all the votes,” he said. “Democracy works, your vote will be counted, I don’t care how hard people try to stop it, I will not let them stop it.”

In Georgia, Mr. Biden went into the lead overnight Thursday, thanks to a vote tally from Clayton County, a Democratic-leaning area near Atlanta. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said the state remained “too close to call” and predicted that it was headed for a recount, given that Mr. Biden’s lead stood at a mere 4,000 or so votes out of five million cast.

If Mr. Biden ends up winning Georgia, it would be a major breakthrough for the Democratic Party in the Republican-dominated Deep South: Democrats rarely win top statewide races outside of Florida, North Carolina and Virginia. No Democratic presidential candidate has carried Georgia since 1992, when Bill Clinton narrowly won there.

Mr. Biden held a lead of about 30,000 votes in Arizona, after a new tranche of ballots from Maricopa County, the state’s population center, helped Mr. Trump close the gap by about 7,000 votes on Friday night. 

Katie Hobbs, the Arizona secretary of state, said on CNN that 173,000 ballots remained to be counted statewide, including 92,000 in Maricopa County. 

In Nevada, Mr. Biden picked up about 2,500 votes in the Las Vegas area, officials said late Friday, giving him a lead of more than 22,000. Tens of thousands of ballots remain to be counted, but they continue to favor Mr. Biden.

It was in Pennsylvania, though, where the race seemed to turn emphatically in Mr. Biden’s direction. Early Friday morning, a few thousand votes from Philadelphia were posted, vaulting the former vice president into the statewide lead and setting off joyous celebrations in the city where Mr. Biden formally began his campaign last year and has long considered a second home. By Friday evening, Mr. Biden was leading in the state by about 29,000 votes.

Outside the city’s convention center, jubilant Biden supporters danced along a blockaded part of the street as a D.J. with a speaker system blasted music. They unfurled a banner declaring “The People Have Spoken.”

Pennsylvania Democrats, however, were growing frustrated by the slow count and were eager for Philadelphia and Pittsburgh to post more returns.

In what appeared to be another attempt to create an artificial sense of uncertainty around the vote count, the Pennsylvania Republican Party appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday, asking it to order state election officials to separate mail-in ballots that arrived after Election Day from all the other votes they were tabulating — even though Republicans acknowledgedin the filing that Pennsylvania’s secretary of state had already issued an order to that effect.

The attempt to involve the Supreme Court came as part of a larger legal fight over mail-in balloting rules in Pennsylvania, in which the high court has already declined twice to get involved. But state authorities said there were fewer mail-in votes arriving after Tuesday than they had anticipated, suggesting that the stakes in the litigation might be relatively low.

Late Friday, a federal court in Nevada denied an injunction request by Republicans that could have delayed the count here by several days. 

So far, lawsuits brought by Mr. Trump and other Republicans this week have had no meaningful effect on the tabulation of ballots, and they seem designed largely or even entirely for public-relations purposes. 



Campaign officials met with White House officials on Friday, including the White House counsel Pat Cipollone, an administration official confirmed, but the legal path forward for Mr. Trump to contest the validity of the election results wasn’t resolved. On Friday, Mr. Trump vowed to exhaust all legal options available to him, making his case in an emailed statement to the news media by his campaign.

Mr. Trump has been as angry in private as he has been in public, people who have spoken to him said. One adviser said the president wants “fighters” defending him and is as concerned with the news media battle as he is with the legal challenges.

Fleeting efforts to gently make him understand that the situation is bleak and unlikely to change haven’t been successful. And he is being egged on by Rudolph W. Giuliani, his personal lawyer, and a small handful of White House advisers.

But another group of advisers have been more candid with Mr. Trump. Late Thursday and on Friday afternoon, a handful of aides told the president that they’re willing to keep fighting the legal battles, but that it is an uphill climb without a likely positive outcome, according to people familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss private conversations. Mr. Trump, one adviser said, heard what they were saying, but is not yet ready to accept it.

On Capitol Hill, some Republican leaders resisted coming to terms with the likelihood of a Biden presidency, at least in their comments for public consumption. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House minority leader, firmly aligned himself with Mr. Trump. He appeared on Fox News late Thursday night to insist that the president had “won this election” and on Friday said “Republicans will not back down from this battle.” 

But a handful of rank-and-file House G.O.P. lawmakers declined to rise to the president’s defense. “Baseless allegations undermine the public’s confidence in our electoral system, which is the foundation of our Republic,” said Representative Steve Stivers, an Ohioan who was chairman of the House Republican campaign committee two years ago when the midterm backlash against Mr. Trump cost the party its majority.

In private, some longtime House Republicans were dismayed, if not surprised, at the president’s handling of the election. Some said they were eager for him to concede, though Mr. Trump has told allies he has no plans to do so while states are still counting and the vote isn’t certified. What that means in the longer term is not clear.

Yet in a sign of the hold Mr. Trump retains on the party’s hard-line base, few Republicans in either chamber who are not retiring or regular critics of the president would confront him by name. In Kentucky, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, repeatedly evaded questions from reporters about the president’s inflammatory rhetoric, pointing to a statement he had made Friday morning that “every legal vote should be counted.”

There were, however, more indirect signs that Senate Republicans were moving on from the Trump years. Mr. Graham, an ally of the president’s who just won re-election in commanding fashion, said he was not assuming that Mr. Trump had lost but allowed that he was eager to work on immigration and infrastructure and that he also thought Mr. Biden deserved to have his cabinet confirmed.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Mr. Biden the obvious winner in her weekly news conference, telling reporters that he would enter office with a “tremendous mandate” to govern and referring to him as president-elect, even though Mr. Biden himself has not yet declared victory.

The Biden campaign struck a dismissive tone on Friday toward the president’s digging in and depicted him as a sore loser rather than as a menace to the democratic process.

Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr. Biden, suggested that if Mr. Trump declined to concede an election he had lost, then “the United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House.”

Trump’s False Election Fraud Claims Split Republicans,"WASHINGTON — Republican reaction to President Trump’s baseless claims of election fraud ranged widely Friday, from vigorous agreement to sharp condemnations, and in between some carefully constructed statements supporting the idea of fair elections without any endorsement of the president’s fabricated assertions of an election conspiracy.

“Here’s how this must work in our great country: Every legal vote should be counted,” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, wrote on Twitter Friday morning. “Any illegally-submitted ballots must not. All sides must get to observe the process. And the courts are here to apply the laws & resolve disputes.”

“That’s how Americans’ votes decide the result,” he added.

Notably absent from Mr. McConnell’s statement was any suggestion that Democrats were stealing the election through an elaborate national conspiracy that included pollsters and the news media, as Mr. Trump asserted with no evidence in a rambling news conference on Thursday. It also implicitly rejected Mr. Trump’s fruitless calls for a halt to vote counting in states where his early leads have been threatened or eliminated.

In a stinging statement, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah said that Mr. Trump, while free to request recounts and present valid evidence of fraud, “is wrong to say that the election was rigged, corrupt and stolen — doing so weakens the cause of freedom here and around the world, weakens the institutions that lie at the foundations of the republic, and recklessly inflames destructive and dangerous passions.”

As Mr. Trump and his die-hard allies maintained that the vote in Pennsylvania — where his early lead over former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., evaporated on Friday — was badly corrupted, that state’s Republican senator, Patrick J. Toomey, condemned Mr. Trump’s claims.

“The president’s speech last night was very disturbing to me because he made very, very serious allegations without any evidence to support it,” Mr. Toomey told “CBS This Morning.”

“I am not aware of any significant fraud, any significant wrongdoing,” he added.

Some Republicans seem prepared to defend Mr. Trump’s position without reservation, however.

“President Trump won this election,” Representative Kevin McCarthy of California told the Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Thursday night. “So everyone who’s listening: Do not be quiet. Do not be silent about this. We cannot allow this to happen before our very eyes.”

Claiming without evidence that poll watchers have not been able to watch vote counts, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas tweeted a link to Mr. Trump’s legal defense fund, with the headline, in all capital letters, “The Democrats Will Try to Steal This Election.”

Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida even told Fox News that if Mr. Trump were denied what he called a “fair” count, then state legislatures could consider “remedies,” suggesting that they might direct their electors to vote against their state’s election winner.

But other Republican governors were much less supportive. Utah’s lieutenant governor, and now governor-elect, Spencer Cox, said “there is nothing nefarious about it taking a few days to count all legitimate votes.” Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont, who voted for Mr. Biden, called Mr. Trump’s Thursday comments “absolutely shameful.”

Even Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump, in a superficially supportive tweet on Friday morning, made no claims of fraud or election theft.

“Every legally cast vote should be counted. Every illegally cast vote should not. This should not be controversial,” Ms. Trump wrote. “This is not a partisan statement — free and fair elections are the foundation of our democracy.”

Her words were a contrast to those of her brothers, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, who have both made sweeping accusations of widespread fraud. Earlier in the morning, Donald Trump Jr. tweeted the groundless claim that there is “infinitely more evidence of voter fraud than there ever was of ‘Russia Collusion’ but strangely no one in the media wants to look into it.”

Ms. Trump’s position also echoed one on Thursday evening from Vice President Mike Pence, shortly after the president spoke, which also did not include talk of conspiracy or fraud.

“I Stand With President @realDonaldTrump. We must count every LEGAL vote,” Mr. Pence tweeted.

Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser John R. Bolton, who since his acrimonious departure from the White House last summer has become a Trump critic, indirectly condemned his former boss without mentioning his name.

“Republicans are facing a character test,” Mr. Bolton wrote on Twitter. “All candidates are entitled to pursue appropriate election-law remedies if they have evidence supporting their claims. They should certainly not lie. The first Republican president was called ‘Honest Abe’ for a reason.”

The statements on Friday followed a wave of Republican reaction on Thursday night, including some defenses of Mr. Trump.

“I don’t trust Philadelphia,” the newly re-elected Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said, also on Fox News, referring to the city where voters overwhelmingly chose Mr. Biden, helping eliminate Mr. Trump’s early lead. “I’m here tonight to stand with President Trump,” he said, echoing Mr. Trump’s claim that “mainstream” pollsters had inflated Democratic numbers to “suppress Republican votes.”

But many more senior Republicans were at least indirectly critical of Mr. Trump, even after Mr. Trump’s son and former campaign manager publicly complained that more Republicans were not stepping forward to defend the embattled president.

“Counting every vote is at the heart of democracy,” Mr. Romney wrote the night before his more forceful statement on Friday.

“There is no defense for the President’s comments tonight undermining our Democratic process,” tweeted Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a Republican and frequent Trump critic. “No election or person is more important than our Democracy.”

Several Republicans noted the absence of any specific evidence of substantive wrongdoing.

“If a candidate believes a state is violating election laws they have a right to challenge it in court & produce evidence in support of their claims,” tweeted Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who reposted a message from Wednesday in which he said, “Taking days to count legally cast votes is NOT fraud. And court challenges to votes cast after the legal voting deadline is NOT suppression.”

Without naming Mr. Trump, Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois tweeted that “if you have legit concerns about fraud present EVIDENCE and take it to court. STOP Spreading debunked misinformation.”

“This is getting insane,” he added."
Biden on the Brink,"Biden inches closer to 270, while Trump sings a familiar song. It’s Friday, and this is your politics tip sheet. Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.

Just hours ago, Joe Biden took the lead in Georgia, where President Trump’s advantage dissolved steadily as votes were counted late into the night. The race remains extremely tight, with Biden ahead by 1,096 ballots as of early Friday morning.

Perhaps more immediately ominous to Trump’s electoral math, Biden is also quickly catching up to him in Pennsylvania, now trailing by only 18,229 votes. The state, whose 20 electoral votes would hand Biden the presidency if he won it alone, has far more uncounted ballots than Georgia, and they are expected to favor Biden.

It’s unclear when each race might be called. More votes are expected to be counted today.

Georgia carries 16 electoral votes, and if Biden were to win it before Pennsylvania, it would put him at 269, just one away from the presidency. And Trump, of course, could still well win Georgia.

Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Alaska also remain up for grabs. Newly counted ballots in Maricopa County, Ariz., last night cut into Biden’s narrow lead there; more than 200,000 ballots remain to be counted in Maricopa, and just over one percentage point divides Biden and Trump in the state.

Things look more favorable to Trump in North Carolina, which is close, and Alaska, which isn’t particularly. But those states would not be enough to put him anywhere near the necessary 270 electoral votes.

Trump’s legal team has been in courtrooms across the country, challenging vote counts and demanding the right to send supporters into ballot-counting locations. Judicial decisions came down on those cases in a range of states throughout the day, most of them bearing bad news for Trump’s team.

A judge in Pennsylvania shot down his campaign’s attempt to halt the counting of ballots there, but ruled that poll watchers could move to within six feet of officials as they counted ballots, allowing the observers a better vantage to look for absentee ballots lacking the required signatures.

In an address to reporters last night, Trump continued to falsely argue that ballots that haven’t yet been counted are illegal. Speaking from the White House briefing room, he marshaled the optics of the presidency to his advantage even as he unleashed a string of falsehoods intended to undermine a legitimate election.

“If you count the legal votes, I easily win,” he said, offering no evidence.

While the president’s claims were echoed by a number of allies, including Lindsey Graham and Kevin McCarthy, he appeared to be increasingly isolated.

After his briefing room appearance, wrote Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman, “several advisers conceded that the clock on the Trump presidency was almost certainly winding down.”

Biden, by contrast, gave a terse, two-minute update from Wilmington, Del., reassuring the country that it could have faith in the election. “The process is working,” he said.

Standing beside his running mate, Kamala Harris, Biden stated in the strongest terms yet that he was confident of reaching 270 electoral votes. “We have no doubt that when the count is finished, Senator Harris and I will be declared the winners,” he said, while clarifying that he was not yet declaring victory.

Biden, too, sought to convey a presidential mien. He started his speech by saying that he and Harris had just received briefings on the coronavirus pandemic and the economic crisis; it was both a power move (in another, Biden’s team has already unveiled a transition website) and an acknowledgment of what exit polls had indicated: that economic concerns dominated many voters’ attention, particularly those who hadn’t voted for him.

For all the pre-election talk about Florida and Pennsylvania, it’s Georgia that will dominate America’s political attention over the coming weeks.

With votes still being counted across the state, and especially in heavily Black areas around Atlanta and Savannah, Biden appears to have a solid chance to become the first Democratic presidential candidate this millennium to win Georgia. And not one but two Senate races currently hang in the balance there; one is already set to go to a runoff in January, and the other is looking likely to do the same.

Those three races alone are enough to tip the scales in the Senate, which Republicans will control unless Democrats win at least two more seats as well as the White House. And either way, it’s safe to say that Georgia is entering a new phase of political life, in a moment when a once solidly red Sun Belt has turned decidedly purple.

We checked in by phone with Richard Fausset, our correspondent in Atlanta, to get his take on the political situation there as ballots continue to be counted.

Hey Richard. I can only imagine how busy you’ve been the past few days. Where do things stand down there?

We’ve had a large number of outstanding absentee ballots, and it takes time to process those. Those include ballots that come in by mail, or that go in a drop box — and Georgia has 159 counties, which is a lot of counties, each one with drop boxes where people could deposit their absentee ballots up until 7 p.m. on Tuesday.

So you had all of these votes that had to be taken out of envelopes by hand and then they had to be scanned and in some cases looked over by a human being to determine whether they were valid. It’s just taking time. Many of the absentee ballots that are still being counted right now have come from heavily Democratic places: Fulton County and DeKalb County, in the Atlanta area, and Chatham County, where Savannah is.

By when do we think we’ll have all the ballots counted?

Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, said that he hoped the counting of the absentee ballots would be finished by lunchtime on Thursday. But that has not proved to be the case, and since then, Georgia election officials have basically not been making any promises.

Even though the deadline for voting was 7 p.m. on Tuesday, by a combination of federal and state law there are numerous reasons that the story doesn’t end there. You have ballots that have been sent in by mail from overseas — and by federal law, if they’re postmarked by Tuesday, those can be received by county boards of elections by Friday. The same goes for ballots sent in by military personnel abroad.

You also have ballots that had some kind of problem — maybe if the voter didn’t bring their ID or they went to the wrong polling place and they had to file a provisional ballot. In Georgia, you file that ballot and then you usually have to take some kind of supporting document to a county office and cure the ballot. We don’t know how many of those ballots will end up being cured, but we should find out by Friday.

Let’s talk about the two closely fought Senate races that are currently undecided.

There are two very important Senate races in Georgia. In the first one, for the seat vacated last year by the Republican Johnny Isakson, it’s been determined that it will go to a runoff between the Rev. Dr. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, and Senator Kelly Loeffler, a Republican. In the second Senate race — with Senator David Perdue, the Republican, running against a 33-year-old challenger, the Democrat Jon Ossoff — it’s looking like it could go to a runoff as well. Perdue is leading, but he has started dipping beneath 50 percent as ballots come in, and under Georgia state law that would trigger a runoff.

In early January, when those runoffs are set to take place, Georgia could have one of the last big political stories of this election going. It’s a state that has had tremendous demographic change, and a tremendous shifting of the political reality: It’s not hard to imagine millions and millions of dollars and all sorts of political reporters stuffing themselves into the state in January.

Yes, the story of Georgia is front and center right now. But would it be going too far to say that Democrats have ascended there, or is the political situation still much more mixed?

What all this shows is not a new Democratic dominance of politics in Georgia; what it shows is that the Democratic Party is suddenly seriously competitive in the state, which is a big difference from the last few years. There are no statewide elected Democrats in Georgia right now. The governor is a Republican, the State Legislature is controlled by Republicans. And in fact, there have been some big Democratic disappointments this year: They were hoping to pick up a lot of seats in the Legislature, and they got only a few.

You’re going to have a very tough fight for Ossoff and for Warnock if they both go to runoffs. The Republican Party has a big base in the state; the difference now is that Democrats are going to make races difficult and competitive and costly for Republicans in ways that they just haven’t in the last few years.

Trump’s Stunning News Conference,"[As he prepares to assume the presidency, Biden confronts the ultimate test of his approach to governing.]

Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host.

ATLANTA — What the president of the United States did tonight wasn’t complicated but it was stunning, even after four long years of the politically extraordinary.

President Trump attacked democracy.

In his remarks tonight from the White House, Mr. Trump lied about the vote count, smeared his opponents and attempted to undermine the integrity of our electoral system.

“If you count the legal votes, I win,” he said, before ticking off a litany of baseless claims about ways his campaign had supposedly been cheated by his opponents, nonpartisan poll workers and a vast conspiracy of technology companies and big business.

But nothing is “rigged” or “stolen” or “illegal.” No one is “doing a lot of bad things.”

Donald Trump is simply losing.

And he’s apparently decided to try and take our system down with him.

Joe Biden has been cutting into Mr. Trump’s lead, or expanding his own, in three of the four states that will decide the next president: Pennsylvania, Georgia and Nevada. Notably, in the state where Mr. Trump appears to be making gains — Arizona — the president seems to take little issue with the vote count.

The votes that Mr. Trump calls “late” and “illegal” were postmarked by Election Day, making them valid. In Pennsylvania, the Republican-led state legislature wouldn’t allow poll workers to start counting mail ballots until Election Day. So now, they’re being counted.

Instead of letting the process play out, the president is calling on election officials to stop counting ballots, potentially disenfranchising hundreds of thousands of voters. As James Baker, the former secretary of state who led the Republican legal and political team during the Florida recount battle in 2000, told my colleague Peter Baker today: “That’s a very hard decision to defend in a democracy.”

There’s also a pragmatic question about the president’s allegations: If Democrats were going to rig an election, why didn’t they do a better job of it? After many Democrats all but predicted a landslide, the party has so far lost seats in the House and faces a steep path to take control of the Senate. Mr. Trump touted those Republican victories in his comments tonight.

On social media, his family members and allies have been calling for Republicans, like Senator Lindsey Graham, to support the president’s claims — even trying to make the issue an early litmus test for the 2024 campaign. (We haven’t even finished with 2020!) Of course, Republicans who back Mr. Trump could be throwing into question the validity of their own victories.

So with a few exceptions, they’ve largely returned to the position they often adopt with the president: silence. But it may become increasingly difficult to stay quiet.

As he has for months, Mr. Trump indicated that he would not accept the results of the election and would encourage his supporters to do the same — a dangerous game in an already heated political environment. And at least a few voters are listening.

In Arizona, it’s hard for Carla Livak to believe the president could lose her state, where supporters have turned out by the tens of thousands for his rallies, and where car parades in his honor have stretched for miles.

“It’s just hard to believe everything is this close,” she said. “I just don’t believe that.”

The 70-year-old Tucson resident said she thinks that there’s something suspicious happening with vote counting.

“It does feel like with big tech ganging up to censor things, that there are tentacles of power that are unseen,” she said. “He has enemies that are so big, it’s not out of the realm of possibility.”

One thing is certain: Win or lose, Mr. Trump’s conspiracy thinking, and its influence on his supporters, will be part of his legacy.

Trump leads Biden, 49.4 percent to 49.3 percent, with more than 98 percent of the estimated vote in.

Gap: About 3,500 votes.

Keep in mind: Thousands of ballots are left to be counted in Georgia, an official with the secretary of state’s office said Thursday afternoon. Most are in Democratic-leaning counties. The state aims to finish its count by the end of the day.

PENNSYLVANIA

Electoral votes: 20

Trump leads Biden, 49.8 percent to 49.0 percent, with about 94 percent of the estimated vote in.

Gap: About 53,000 votes.

Keep in mind: The state’s top election official said late Thursday that the counties were “still counting” and did not give a direct answer as to how many ballots were still outstanding, estimating that it was “several hundred thousand.” She did not offer any timetable as to when counting in the state would be complete. Most of the votes yet to be counted are in counties where Mr. Biden is ahead, including Philadelphia, the state’s most populous county.

NEVADA

Electoral votes: 6

Biden leads Trump, 49.4 percent to 48.5 percent, with 89 percent of the estimated vote in.

Gap: About 11,000 votes.

Keep in mind: Nevada has about 190,000 ballots still to be counted, the secretary of state said Thursday afternoon. Ninety percent of them are from Clark County, where Mr. Biden currently leads by eight percentage points. All of the Election Day vote has been counted, leaving only Democratic-leaning late mail and provisional ballots to be tabulated.

ARIZONA

Electoral votes: 11

Biden leads Trump, 50.3 percent to 48.3 percent, with 88 percent of the estimated vote in.

Gap: About 57,000 votes.

To keep in mind: Mr. Trump needs to win about 60 percent of the remaining votes to capture the state. More results are expected to be released Thursday night.

NORTH CAROLINA

Electoral votes: 15

Trump leads Biden, 50 percent to 48.6 percent, with 95 percent of the estimated vote in.

Gap: About 77,000 votes.

Keep in mind: With most votes now tabulated, Mr. Biden would need to win about two-thirds of the remainder to pull ahead. Mail ballots postmarked by Election Day will be accepted until Thursday, Nov. 12.

Biden Edges Close to 270,"If Trump goes down, what happens to Trumpism? It’s Thursday, and this is your politics tip sheet. Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.

Two big myths may be in danger of getting busted after the 2020 election.

First, that President Trump is invincible, a political Houdini who would exhaust any means necessary to stay in power — and would inevitably succeed. And second, that if he somehow failed, it would spell the end of his creation, Trumpism, the alternate-reality politics and ethno-nationalist populism that have taken over the Republican Party.

Both of those assumptions may have been wrong.

Joe Biden has now won 253 electoral votes and has multiple routes to the White House, with five swing states still undecided and uncounted votes in several likely to favor him. While Trump has not indicated that he has any plans to concede, and his campaign insists he could still prevail, at this point a path to victory would most likely run through the courts. It’s a hard road ahead for him.

At the same time, if Democrats end up declaring a victory over all, it will be a beleaguered one. Not only did Trump outperform their expectations in the battlegrounds, but Democratic candidates for both the House and the Senate also lost races — some in states that split their tickets and favored Biden for president — that the party had been fairly confident about. They included the fight for Susan Collins’s Senate seat in Maine, a House race in Miami-Dade County and another in eastern Iowa.

In a letter to House Democrats yesterday, Nancy Pelosi acknowledged that it had been “a challenging election.” Which means that for Republicans, almost all of whom ran with their arms wrapped around the president’s politics this year, Trump’s brand is not altogether invalidated. That’s in spite of him looking increasingly likely to lose his re-election bid, a rarity for United States presidents.

If he moves ahead with legal challenges to the counting of votes, Trump could have one big advantage: Justice Amy Coney Barrett, whom he appointed in September and the Senate confirmed last month. She never committed to recusing herself in any election-related cases that might come before the court involving the man who had appointed her.

Barrett’s presence on the court means that the conservative wing wouldn’t need Chief Justice John Roberts, who has shown more reluctance than others to endorse Republican voting challenges, to form a majority.

But Biden has an advantage too: The results have been all but settled, as far as some states are concerned. Michigan and Wisconsin officials have released close to 99 percent of the votes to be tallied, and there is little uncertainty about the results. Without the public perception advantage that George W. Bush had in 2000, it becomes far more complicated for Trump to demand something as drastic as overturning an election.

The president’s remarks in the wee hours of election night, when he brazenly accused election officials across the country of fraud for allowing mail ballots to be counted, became the subject of broad condemnation the next day.

Biden delivered brief, prepared remarks to reporters, with his running mate, Kamala Harris, at his side as he reiterated that his campaign saw an all-but-certain path to 270 electoral votes.

“Yesterday once again proved that democracy is the heartbeat of this nation,” Biden said, pointing out that turnout had broken records. “I’m not here to declare that we’ve won, but I am here to report that when the count is finished we believe we will be the winner.”

As Trump and members of his team made false claims that Pennsylvania was being stolen from them as mail ballots were counted, the state’s Democratic governor, Tom Wolf, vowed to tally every last vote.

“Pennsylvania will have a fair election, and that election will be free of outside influences,” Wolf said. “I will vigorously and we all will vigorously defend against any attempt to attack that vote in Pennsylvania.” The state, which was widely seen as a likely linchpin of this election, will continue until Friday to accept mailed ballots that were postmarked by Nov. 3.

Trump supporters and Republican operatives banged on the glass outside a vote-counting site in Detroit on Wednesday and chanted, “Stop the count.”

Polling didn’t just underestimate Trump’s support — it also misread the support for many Republican Senate candidates, both in and out of Trump’s orbit.

In Maine, Collins has always sought to portray herself as an independent force, and her opponent, Sara Gideon, tried to paint her for the entire campaign as a Trump lap dog. But more than half of the Mainers who voted for Biden identified as moderate or conservative, and three in 10 Biden voters expressed a favorable view of Collins, according to the Maine exit poll. Ultimately, enough split their tickets to hand Collins victory.

In Kentucky and South Carolina, Democratic dreams of upsetting a couple of G.O.P. stalwarts were put to rest unceremoniously, as Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham won thumping victories against Democratic challengers in races that some polls had suggested were quite close — and that drew extravagant sums of money from donors, particularly on the Democratic side.

In Michigan, a Republican challenger, John James, beat the polls by a few points but ultimately came up short in his attempt to unseat the Democratic incumbent, Senator Gary Peters.

Still undecided are two Senate races in Georgia, and one each in North Carolina and Alaska. Any Democratic victories in these states would represent a pickup, but none of the returns so far have been particularly heartening for Democrats. One Georgia Senate race is already heading to a January runoff election, and the other could follow.

If Democrats did manage two more pickups and Biden won the White House, Democrats would regain control of the Senate and hold a majority in both houses of Congress.

Flashbacks to Florida in 2000 as Trump Heads to Court to Save His Presidency,"[Read more on Joe Biden’s president-elect acceptance speech.]

WASHINGTON — The White House hoped to find a “James Baker-like” figure to lead its postelection battle to somehow find a way to win a second term. But the original James Baker says the White House should stop trying to stop the votes from being counted.

Mr. Baker, the former secretary of state who led the legal and political team during the epic Florida recount battle in 2000 that secured the presidency for George W. Bush, said in an interview on Thursday that President Trump may have legitimate issues to pursue, but they should not be used to justify halting the initial tabulation of ballots.

“We never said don’t count the votes,” said Mr. Baker, a Republican who voted for Mr. Trump. “That’s a very hard decision to defend in a democracy.”

The wrangling since Tuesday has evoked many memories and not a few post-traumatic stress flashbacks from the showdown in Florida that riveted the world. Figures like Mr. Baker, now retired and spending much of his time at his Texas ranch after recovering from the coronavirus, have been evoked as proxies for the current debate. But the comparisons only go so far.

In the 2000 episode, Mr. Bush, the Republican candidate, and Al Gore, the Democrat, did not start their legal fight until after the votes in Florida were already counted. Mr. Bush finished election night with a lead of 1,784 votes out of some six million cast in the state that would ultimately determine which candidate would win the Electoral College. Because the margin was so small, an automatic machine recount was then conducted, upholding Mr. Bush’s lead.

Arguing that some ballots were improperly disqualified or otherwise not counted, Mr. Gore’s team went to court asking for hand recounts in four heavily Democratic counties while Mr. Baker argued that the votes did not need to be counted again. By the time the Supreme Court halted the process more than a month later on the grounds that different counties were applying different standards, Mr. Bush’s lead had been pared to 537, still enough to win.

Mr. Trump, by comparison, has sought to prevent even the first round of counting and to exclude whole batches of mail-in ballots. In a middle-of-the-night appearance after the closing of the polls, the president characterized the routine counting of votes as an effort to steal the election without any evidence at all. “STOP THE COUNT!” he wrote on Twitter on Thursday as his lawyers tried in vain to do just that. While Mr. Bush was trying to preserve his victory, Mr. Trump is trying to overturn what may be his opponent’s.

“There are huge differences,” Mr. Baker said of the Florida battle and the brewing fights over this week’s election. “For one thing, our whole argument was that the votes have been counted and they’ve been counted and they’ve been counted and it’s time to end the process. That’s not exactly the message I heard on election night. And so I think it’s pretty hard to be against counting the votes.”

As an example, he criticized the Republican effort to throw out 127,000 votes in Harris County, which includes his hometown, Houston, because they were cast through a drive-through system that the party objected to. “I didn’t think that was a particularly wise thing to do and, as it turns out, it wasn’t wise legally because they’ve lost in state court and in federal court,” he said.

That in some ways mirrored one of the side battles in the Florida fight when Democrats asked courts to throw out 25,000 absentee ballots in two other counties because of “irregularities” with the way the ballot applications were handled. Two Florida judges rejected the effort, ruling that any procedural issues by local authorities did not justify preventing voters from having their ballots counted.

One of the lawyers who argued against the Republican effort in Texas this week was Benjamin L. Ginsberg, one of the nation’s most pre-eminent Republican election lawyers and part of Mr. Baker’s recount team in 2000. In a friend of the court brief in federal court, Mr. Ginsberg compared the Texas Republican bid to exclude the drive-through ballots to the fight over the 25,000 ballots in Florida.

In an interview, Mr. Ginsberg said Mr. Trump’s effort to stop the count wholesale was dangerous. “It’s part and parcel of him tearing down the democratic core institution of free elections by saying they’re rigged without providing any real evidence,” he said.

Mr. Ginsberg was part of the all-star Republican legal team that Mr. Baker assembled in Florida on the fly. Among them were three future members of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Brett M. Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, as well as a future senator, Ted Cruz of Texas; a future national security adviser, John R. Bolton; and prominent lawyers like Theodore Olson and Michael Carvin.

Mr. Trump, for his part, has had little luck attracting anything like that kind of high-level Republican legal firepower this week, relying on Rudolph W. Giuliani, his personal lawyer, and his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, among others, to carry his message.

Mr. Baker, who ran five Republican presidential campaigns, has been sharply critical of Mr. Trump at times and refused to publicly endorse him, but still voted for him this fall, citing fears of a “far left” agenda if Democrats led by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. were to take over.

Mr. Baker said that Mr. Trump has every right to pursue any legitimate challenges after the votes are counted. “You’re entitled to contest or question the results of any election in any state until you’re satisfied that it’s been conducted fairly and openly,” he said. “That’s not failing to accept a peaceful transition of power.”

Mr. Baker agreed that Mr. Trump should find someone like Mr. Baker to serve as a field marshal. “Message discipline,” he said, “is particularly important in something like this.”

But at 90, he is ready for it to be someone else."
"Amid Tears and Anger, House Democrats Promise ‘Deep Dive’ on Election Losses","[As he prepares to assume the presidency, Biden confronts the ultimate test of his approach to governing.]

WASHINGTON — Democrats wept, cursed and traded blame on Thursday during an extraordinary party confab to dissect the disappointing results of this week’s elections, agreeing on little except that they needed a “deep dive” into how they had ended up with painful losses that weakened their House majority instead of the big gains they had boldly predicted.

In a caucus meeting held by telephone that was their first group conversation since Election Day, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois, who led the party’s campaign arm, defended their efforts. Democrats expressed frustration over the loss of eight of their members — and a net loss of six seats, with 33 races still undecided — that had left them with a slimmer margin of control.

Party leaders noted that Democrats appeared on track to hold the House, thanks to hard-fought victories by incumbents in competitive districts, and that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. appeared headed toward a victory, according to seven people on the call who requested anonymity to divulge a conversation that was intended to be private.

“We did not win every battle, but we did win the war,” Ms. Pelosi said.

But during the call, which lasted three hours and previewed divisions among Democrats over how to wield their power and define their message, Ms. Bustos conceded that things had gone badly awry. She said she was “gutted” and “heartbroken” by the losses.

“Something went wrong,” Ms. Bustos said, blaming incorrect modeling of the electorate in polling, and promising a “deep dive” on the matter. “They all pointed to one political environment, but voters who turned out looked a lot like 2016.”

“We protected the lone firewall in our democracy,” she added. “Now hopefully and probably with Joe Biden to take back the White House, we are now in a position to put our priorities into action because we held on to this fragile majority.”

It was a bitter pill for Democrats who had been ebullient only days before about their chances. On Election Day, Ms. Pelosi and Ms. Bustos had crowed about their likelihood of success. Ms. Pelosi cited predictions that the party could pick up five, 10 or even 20 seats and said she was worried about “fewer than a handful of incumbents.” Both women, though, declined to offer their own precise predictions.

But by Thursday, one of the incumbents Democrats had spent heavily to defend, Representative Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, who was defeated Tuesday night as President Trump won a resounding victory in her Miami-area district, broke into tears as she spoke out to her soon-to-be former colleagues about internal divides in the party.

“We have a divided America,” Ms. Mucarsel-Powell said during the call. “Continue to fight for kids or what you believe in, but if you have a problem, pick up the phone — don’t tweet it out.”

Representative Abigail Spanberger, who narrowly escaped defeat on Wednesday in a conservative-leaning district in Virginia that Democrats had also toiled to protect, chastised her progressive colleagues for embracing the “defund the police” movement and for not pushing back forcefully against accusations of socialism. If Democrats did not acknowledge the election results as a “failure” and change strategies, she said using an expletive for emphasis, they would be “crushed” in future elections.

To that, Ms. Pelosi objected.

“I disagree, Abigail, that it was a failure,” she said. “We won the House.”

Ms. Bustos, who herself won re-election only narrowly, emphasized the success of the so-called front liners, about 40 mostly freshman Democrats including Ms. Spanberger, who hold seats in traditionally conservative districts. While some lost this week, most were poised for victory.

“These were seats that were in Trump country, and we were able to hold onto 30 seats that are Trump districts, and that’s no small feat,” she said.

Ms. Bustos also defended the Democrats’ offensive push deeper into Republican territory, a move that yielded few pickups and some members said left incumbents inadequately protected.

Losses for Democrats included freshmen in swing districts — like Representatives Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, Xochitl Torres Small of New Mexico, Kendra Horn of Oklahoma and Abby Finkenauer of Iowa — but also a veteran, Representative Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota, who leads the Agriculture Committee and has served in the House for three decades.

One of the biggest surprises of the election came in South Florida, where Mr. Trump made significant inroads among Cuban-Americans. Along with Ms. Mucarsel-Powell, Representative Donna E. Shalala, another first-term Democrat representing the Miami area, lost.

Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the third-ranking Democrat, said the party needed to overcome racial animus in the electorate, and had to shy away from certain far-left policies that alienate key segments of voters if Democrats wanted to win a pair of Senate seats currently in play in Georgia.

“Those two seats offer us the opportunity to change the dynamics in the Senate, but we are going to have to win those seats to do it,” he said. He cautioned against running on “Medicare for all or defunding police or socialized medicine,” adding that if Democrats pursued such policies, “we’re not going to win.”

Representative Marc Veasey of Texas warned his fellow members against antifracking talk, saying it was turnoff to voters in South Texas: “They hear, ‘Take away jobs.’”

But some progressives urged against turning away from liberal policies they argued had galvanized the party’s core supporters.

Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, a leader of the Progressive Caucus, said the “turnout of our progressive base” would be the crucial factor in electing Mr. Biden.

“This is a huge win,” Ms. Jayapal said. “We didn’t get the repudiation of Trump we wanted, but we turned out huge numbers of young people, brown and Black people. Don’t be so quick to blame the members who have been responsible for energizing these groups, who will ultimately save the day in the race for the White House.”

Representative Rashida Tlaib, a progressive freshman Democrat from Detroit, was more blunt.

“To be real, it sounds like you are saying stop pushing for what Black folks want,” she said hours into the call, counseling colleagues not to rush to conclusions before studying who turned out to vote.

“I feel like I’m being asked to be quiet,” she said, adding her constituents “didn’t elect me to be quiet.”"
"In Torrent of Falsehoods, Trump Claims Election Is Being Stolen","WASHINGTON — Even for President Trump, it was an imagined version of reality, one in which he was not losing but the victim of a wide-ranging conspiracy stretching across the country in multiple cities, counties and states, involving untold numbers of people all somehow collaborating to steal the election in ways he could not actually explain.

Never mind that Mr. Trump presented not a shred of evidence during his first public appearance since late on election night or that few senior Republican officeholders endorsed his false claims of far-reaching fraud. A presidency born in a lie about Barack Obama’s birthplace appeared on the edge of ending in a lie about his own faltering bid for re-election.

“If you count the legal votes, I easily win,” Mr. Trump said Thursday night in an unusually subdued, 17-minute televised statement from the lectern in the White House briefing room, complaining that Democrats, the news media, pollsters, big technology companies and nonpartisan election workers had all corruptly sought to deny him a second term.

“This is a case where they’re trying to steal an election,” he said. “They’re trying to rig an election, and we can’t let that happen.”

He convinced few people who were not already in his corner. Most of the television networks cut away from the statement on the grounds that what Mr. Trump was saying was not true. On CNN, former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, a Republican often put in the position of defending Mr. Trump over the years, appeared exasperated as he denounced the president’s loose talk of election thievery as “dangerous” and “shocking” and declared that “counting absentee ballots and counting mail-in ballots is not fraud.”

The New York Post, which published salacious articles on Hunter Biden planted by Mr. Trump’s associates before the election, headlined an article: “Downcast Trump Makes Baseless Election Fraud Claims in White House Address.” Even Fox News noted it had seen no “hard evidence” of widespread wrongdoing.

“There is no defense for the President’s comments tonight undermining our Democratic process,” Gov. Larry Hogan, Republican of Maryland and a critic of the president, wrote on Twitter. “America is counting the votes, and we must respect the results as we always have before. No election or person is more important than our Democracy.”

Former Gov. Chris Christie, Republican of New Jersey and a longtime ally of Mr. Trump’s, likewise disputed the president. “I talk tonight now not as a former governor but as a former U.S. attorney — there’s just no basis to make that argument tonight,” he said on ABC News. “There just isn’t.”

With his presidency on the line, Mr. Trump’s lonely appearance in the briefing room with no allies joining him and only staff members and reporters in attendance underscored how isolated he has become just two days after Election Day. With vote counts in key states turning grimmer even as he spoke, Mr. Trump was poised to end this term in office the way he began his presidential campaign in 2015 — defended most vocally by family members and a few loyalists while Republican leaders held him at arm’s length rather than embrace outlandish claims.

With Republican members of Congress largely staying silent or issuing anodyne comments about the importance of transparent vote counting, Mr. Trump was left to dispatch his two adult sons to hold news conferences in Pennsylvania and Georgia to protest aspects of the vote count. They were accompanied by allies like Rudolph W. Giuliani, his personal lawyer, and Corey Lewandowski, his first campaign manager from 2016. The same scene played out in Nevada, where a Trump ally, Richard Grenell, made claims about voting fraud that news outlets debunked a short time later.

Members of Mr. Trump’s inner circle sounded almost desperate as they sought to threaten other Republicans into backing Mr. Trump. Both Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump posted messages on Twitter complaining that Republicans were not standing with their father, especially those who may want his support if they run for president in four years.

“The total lack of action from virtually all of the ‘2024 GOP hopefuls’ is pretty amazing,” Donald Trump Jr. wrote. “They have a perfect platform to show that they’re willing & able to fight but they will cower to the media mob instead.”

“Where are Republicans!” Eric Trump added about an hour and a half later. “Have some backbone. Fight against this fraud. Our voters will never forget you if your sheep!”

Brad Parscale, who was removed this year as the president’s campaign manager, echoed the theme in more menacing terms. “If you want to win in 2024 as a Republican,” he wrote, “I would probably start saying something.”

After Donald Trump Jr. went after Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, for not speaking up, the senator went on Sean Hannity’s show on Fox on Thursday night and came to the president’s defense, asserting with no evidence that “Philadelphia elections are crooked as a snake” and that the “allegations of wrongdoing are earth shattering.”

Others like Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and John Barrasso of Wyoming offered support for Mr. Trump’s insistence that election observers be allowed to watch counting, which in general they are, without embracing the claims that the election was being stolen. “The president is right to ensure all legally cast votes be observed and counted,” Mr. Barrasso said.

But they were among the few who spoke up to echo Mr. Trump’s refrain that he was being denied his due in the form of winning the election, a primal scream emanating from the president that was summed up earlier in the day by his own angry, plaintive, all-caps tweet: “STOP THE COUNT!”

Allies said privately that the president seemed to be raging against the inevitable and was only doing damage with his baseless accusations about widespread fraud. Even allies who said they shared some of his concerns in a targeted way about specific rules governing mail-in voting during the coronavirus pandemic were unwilling to join Mr. Trump’s unfounded claims.

Many of those who did comment merely said they wanted “transparency” or for all “legal” votes to be counted, a phrase used by Vice President Mike Pence on Twitter that was intended to sound as if he was echoing Mr. Trump. Inside Mr. Trump’s circle, Kellyanne Conway, his former counselor, was one of the few who spoke of counting all of the votes.

For much of the year, some Trump advisers questioned whether the president actually wanted a second term, or if he simply did not want to be seen as the worst epithet in his lexicon: a loser. The answer still was not clear as the votes were being tallied this week.

He sounded dejected on Thursday evening as he went through a litany of random minor incidents involving ballots, called Philadelphia and Detroit “corrupt” and insisted he had actually won an election in which former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was leading by millions of votes nationally and appeared likely to assemble a majority in the Electoral College once a handful of swing states finished counting.

Mr. Trump bemoaned how many by-mail votes appeared to be cast for Democrats. “They’re finding ballots all of a sudden: ‘Oh, we have some mail-in ballots,’” he said. “It’s amazing how those mail-in ballots are so one-sided.” He glossed over the fact that he had spent months telling his supporters that mail-in balloting was corrupt and urging them to vote in person instead.

He likewise lashed out at others, as well, seeking many to blame for his troubles. “The pollsters got it knowingly wrong,” he said. (In fact, they did get many results wrong, but there is no evidence that it was intentional.)

“The voting apparatus of those states are run in all cases by Democrats,” he said of states still counting. (In fact, Georgia and Arizona have Republican governors.)

“We won a case, a big case,” he said. (In fact, the campaign simply won a court ruling saying that observers should be allowed to stand six feet away from counting rather than farther away.)

After he was done, the president took no questions from reporters and marched out of the room, looking glum. It was the kind of appearance that several aides had said made them happy he had remained out of public view since the early hours of Wednesday morning, when he insisted he had won the election as several key states still had not had a projected winner and called what was taking place a “fraud” on the American public.

The Trump campaign is filing a series of lawsuits, but allies of the White House have said the approach seems to be aimed at both running out the clock and appeasing a litigious president, who often turns to legal filings as an immediate course of action.

But while Mr. Trump has some experienced lawyers and political professionals leading his campaign, the public effort to raise questions about the election has been disjointed and appeared thrown together at the last minute. Some administration officials said they were mortified by footage of Mr. Giuliani bellowing in Philadelphia.

Some of Mr. Trump’s allies have encouraged the call for a blitz of legal action, including people like Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House chief strategist who faces criminal charges for an allegedly fraudulent scheme scamming supporters of Mr. Trump’s border wall.

Republicans have begun having discussions about how to broach the topic with Mr. Trump of focusing on life after the presidency, and what leaving quietly could mean for his family, his business and his own ability to remain in politics.

Some have suggested that sounding notes of encouragement about a 2024 campaign could be effective. Others believe that he will concede if it is clear he has lost, but that he will most likely never publicly accept the result.

In the meantime, Mr. Trump’s advisers were divided on what he should be doing until the final vote counts are announced. There were some discussions about his holding a rally as soon as this weekend, one person briefed on the talks said.

But after Mr. Trump’s briefing room appearance, several advisers conceded that the clock on the Trump presidency was almost certainly winding down.

Secretaries of State in Spotlight as Trump Ratchets Up Attacks to Sow Doubt,"PHILADELPHIA — They typically operate behind the scenes and far from the spotlight. But as the final count in the 2020 presidential election drags on and President Trump assaults the integrity of the results, otherwise obscure secretaries of state, election commissioners and clerks have found their every utterance meriting breaking news interruptions and all-caps cable chyrons.

With the occupant of the White House hinging on the results in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, the Trump campaign has sought to ratchet up pressure on election officials, threatening legislation and trying to shape public opinion with carnival-like events. Mr. Trump himself baselessly claimed widespread fraud and that people were “trying to steal the election,” at a news conference Thursday evening. And the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., even tried to make support of the effort a litmus test of the 2024 Republican presidential primary.

“Everyone should be watching who is actually fighting this flagrant nonsense and who is sitting on the sidelines,” he wrote Thursday afternoon on Twitter. An hour later, he fumed, “The total lack of action from virtually all of the ‘2024 GOP hopefuls’ is pretty amazing.”

Through it all, election administrators have continued to diligently tabulate the votes.

“Fast is great, and we appreciate fast; we more appreciate accuracy,” said Gabriel Sterling, the voting system implementation manager in Georgia, who serves under the Republican secretary of state and lists himself as a conservative in his Twitter bio. He urged patience on Thursday in news conferences — at least one of which aired on CNN — as he announced the county-by-county vote counts that slimmed Mr. Trump’s lead to a sliver.

“Accuracy is going to be the bedrock upon which people will believe the outcomes of these elections, be they on the winning side or the losing side,” Mr. Sterling said.

The thirst for electoral updates was so intense that on CNN, a live shot of the facility where vote counting was underway in critical Philadelphia appeared throughout the day.

On a downtown street corner outside that building, two prominent Trump allies — Pam Bondi, the former attorney general of Florida, and Corey Lewandowski, his former campaign manager — arrived for the first of three news conferences holding up a court order that permitted poll watchers for the Trump campaign to get closer to observe the ballot counting. Ms. Bondi’s remarks were mostly drowned out by protesters across the street, whose ranks included a D.J. and a full sound system, which blasted “Party” by Beyoncé.

Pennsylvania, with its 20 Electoral College votes, was the pressure campaign’s ground zero. Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, Bill Stepien, read out a 2017 tweet to reporters from the Democratic secretary of state, Kathy Boockvar, that said, “Using the title ‘President’ before the word ‘Trump’ really demeans the office of the presidency.” That, he said, was proof that she was a “partisan hack.”

Another top Trump adviser, Jason Miller, without providing any evidence, referred to “magical sacks of ballots that keep popping up in corrupt and crooked localities that are run by partisan Democrats.”

Ms. Boockvar said at a news conference on Thursday evening that she was unaware of any credible fraud accusations and said the tweet that Mr. Stepien had highlighted preceded her election and her oath of office.

“Partisan politics have no place in the Pennsylvania Department of State,” she said.

Her granular discussion of provisional ballots, precincts reporting and an online supplemental dashboard for mail-in ballots earned live coverage on MSNBC, Fox News and CNN.

The fight in Pennsylvania was so intense that least two groups were airing postelection TV ads, with one urging that every vote be counted and another explaining the process.

“It may take a little longer than we’re used to — even a few days,” Gov. Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, says in one of the ads. “But that’s OK, because it’s critical that your vote is counted.”

Unlike other states, Pennsylvania election officials were prevented from tabulating mail ballots in advance of Election Day by a state law the Republicans in the state Capitol blocked changing, and that has prolonged the count. But Lisa Schaefer, executive director of the bipartisan County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania, which includes election officials across the state, said there was no evidence of inappropriate ballots being counted.

“We are focused on integrity and security and accuracy every step of the way,” she said, adding that the Trump campaign’s comments were simply “making things more confused.”

In Georgia, a lawsuit filed by the Trump campaign claiming that absentee ballots had been mishandled by Chatham County elections officials was dismissed Thursday by a superior court judge — a blow to the first of what the Georgia Republican Party said Wednesday would be up to a dozen lawsuits targeting counties still counting votes.

In Nevada, where Mr. Biden’s narrow lead expanded slightly on Thursday, dozens of flag-waving supporters of Mr. Trump gathered at the Clark County election center in North Las Vegas Thursday morning to protest, claiming that the election was being stolen. Trucks with Trump flags circled the block, some gunning their engines and honking their horns.

Richard Grenell, a Trump adviser who served in his administration as acting director of national intelligence, held a news conference there to level accusations that “illegal votes” were being counted. Again, he provided no specific evidence.

Joe Gloria, registrar of voters in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, held a news conference of his own at the election center and said county officials had established “security at all of its entrances.”

“We are not aware of any improper ballots that are being processed,” he added.

False rumors that using a Sharpie could invalidate a ballot, which began in Arizona, reached into neighboring New Mexico, where the secretary of state, Maggie Toulouse Oliver, said people were calling her office worried that, because they had used a marker to fill out their ballot, their vote would be invalidated.

Ms. Toulouse Oliver, who is also the president of the National Association of Secretaries of State, said that election workers this year had faced more hostility from poll monitors than in years past.

Given the stressors of the coronavirus pandemic, false rumors and intimidating protesters or monitors, she said, she was worried that some election workers might not return for the next election and was concerned by the videos she saw, in Detroit and Phoenix and elsewhere, of people crowding around ballot-counting centers.

“Who wouldn’t be terrified under these conditions, under a mob of people?” she said.

Mr. Trump showed no sign of relenting. “STOP THE COUNT,” he tweeted. (Later, his campaign sent out another statement from the president claiming Mr. Trump would lose only if “illegal” votes were counted.)

Such comments drew bipartisan rebukes.

“It reminds me of the criticism we’ve leveled at authoritarian governments who, under the guise of democracy, have tried to control and limit the counting of votes,” said former Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, a Republican who served as homeland security secretary under President George W. Bush. “There is no place for it in America.”

Mr. Ridge, a chair of a voting-rights group called VoteSafe who supported Mr. Biden in 2020, denounced the Trump campaign’s “hot and unnecessary rhetoric around bogus claims.”

Tom Daschle, a former Senate Democratic leader and a member of the National Council on Election Integrity, which was behind some of the Pennsylvania ads, called the Trump campaign’s rhetoric “corrosive.”

“It is dangerous because if people question the outcome of the election they are really questioning the essence of our democratic republic,” Mr. Daschle said. Among the other board members of the group airing “count every vote” ads in Pennsylvania was Dan Coats, Mr. Trump’s first director of national intelligence.

Biden Pulls Ahead in Key States as Anxious Nation Awaits Winner,"[Joe Biden has won the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Read our story]

Joseph R. Biden Jr. pulled into the lead in the critical states of Pennsylvania and Georgia on Friday as the slow-moving vote count in contested battleground states moved him closer to capturing 270 electoral votes and defeating President Trump.

As an anxious country waited to learn the winner, the two candidates emerged toward day’s end on Thursday to make remarks that were dramatically different in tone and content.

In a brief appearance before reporters in Wilmington, Del., Mr. Biden said he remained confident that he would ultimately prevail but did not lay claim to the White House.

“Democracy’s sometimes messy,” said Mr. Biden, who remained ahead in Arizona on Thursday night but lost some ground there. “It sometimes requires a little patience as well. But that patience has been rewarded now for more than 240 years with a system of governance that’s been the envy of the world.”

He urged calm and emphasized that “each ballot must be counted.”

Hours later, in a stunning appearance in the White House briefing room, Mr. Trump lied about the vote-counting underway in several states, conjuring up a conspiracy of “legal” and “illegal” ballots being tabulated and claiming without evidence that states were trying to deny him re-election.

“They’re trying to steal an election, they’re trying to rig an election,” the president said from the White House briefing room. He also baselessly suggested nefarious behavior in Philadelphia and Detroit, cities that he called “two of the most corrupt political places.”

Mr. Trump’s remarks, mostly read off notes, were at times more valedictory than defiant. Far from insisting that he would stay in power, he used much of his appearance to complain about pre-election polls, demonize the news media and try to put the best face on Tuesday’s results, trumpeting his party’s congressional gains. He did not take questions from reporters.

For all of his complaints, Mr. Trump has only himself and his own party to blame for the delayed vote count in a number of states.

State and local Republican officials refused to let localities tally mail-in votes before Tuesday in some states. And because of Mr. Trump’s monthslong attacks on mail ballots, more Democrats than Republicans voted in that fashion, which has allowed Mr. Biden to pick up the bulk of the votes arriving in the mail. 

In his speech, Mr. Trump expressed no concern about the protracted vote count in Arizona, a state where he has been cutting into Mr. Biden’s lead as more ballots are tabulated.

Republican leaders offered no immediate response to Mr. Trump’s remarks, but a small group of maverick lawmakers in the party denounced his comments, seeking to reassure voters that there was no reason to believe the integrity of the election had been undermined.

Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois and a frequent critic of Mr. Trump, offered the sharpest rebuke, saying “this is getting insane” and demanding that the president stop “spreading debunked misinformation.”

Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey and an adviser to Mr. Trump, said on ABC that “we heard nothing today about any evidence,” adding of the president’s actions, “All it does is inflame without informing.”

Yet there were also Republican lawmakers who rushed to Mr. Trump’s defense, siding with him in falsely asserting that the vote counting was illegal and Democrats were trying to cheat. 

Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, called Mr. Trump’s allegations that ballots were being mishandled in Pennsylvania “earth-shattering” and told Fox News’s Sean Hannity that he planned to donate $500,000 to the president’s legal defense fund.

“They are just trying to get an outcome — damn the law, damn the outcome,” Mr. Graham said of Democrats. 

Also on Fox News, Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, said falsely that the president had “won this election,” and addressed viewers: “Everyone who’s listening, do not be quiet. Do not be silent about this. We cannot allow this to happen before our very eyes.” 



With the world watching to see if one of the most unusual presidencies in the country’s history was coming to an end, America’s patchwork of electoral laws created a confusing and angst-inducing day for both parties, to say nothing of millions of Americans eager for the campaign’s conclusion.

Mr. Biden’s advantage in Arizona, a state The Associated Press has already called for the former vice president, narrowed as thousands of votes were tabulated. But in Georgia and Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump saw his lead evaporate as mail-in ballots were counted.

Until Mr. Trump’s remarks on Thursday night, he had not appeared in public since he used a middle-of-the-night appearance Wednesday to insist he had already won. But he has posted angry Twitter messages, and he continued to do so Thursday.

“All of the recent Biden claimed States will be legally challenged by us for Voter Fraud and State Election Fraud,” he said in one message, without elaborating on what precisely that would involve. “STOP THE COUNT!” he exclaimed in another tweet.

Rebuking the president, Twitter labeled some of the messages “disputed” and said they “might be misleading about an election or other civic process.”

In any event, stopping the count now would only ensure that Mr. Biden wins the presidency, because he is leading in Arizona and Nevada — states that together would give him 270 electoral votes.

The presidential contest was not the only tight race drawing attention. A key Georgia Senate race that could decide the majority in the chamber grew even closer as Senator David Perdue, a Republican, saw his vote share slip under 50 percent in his race against Jon Ossoff, a Democrat. If neither wins a majority, the race would head to a January runoff, setting up the prospect of a hotly contested battle for two Senate seats in Georgia. A runoff is already planned in the special election for the state’s other seat.

On Thursday, an array of Mr. Trump’s political surrogates fanned out to some of the contested states to rally his supporters. And the president’s lawyers filed lawsuits in several states questioning the integrity of the vote count in hopes of slowing down the process.

He suffered two legal setbacks on Thursday when judges in Georgia and Michigan ruled against his campaign. But Mr. Trump notched a minor victory in Pennsylvania when a state appellate court acceded to its request to force Philadelphia election officials to grant its election observers better access to areas where workers are counting ballots.

With the counting proceeding slowly in the West, much of the focus on Thursday fell on Pennsylvania, where a victory would deliver Mr. Biden the presidency no matter the results in the other states. The top election official in the state said on Thursday evening that counties were “still counting” and did not offer any timetable for when the tally would be complete.

By early Friday, Mr. Biden had overtaken Mr. Trump as mail-in ballots were counted in the heavily Democratic cities and suburbs.

The two parties held dueling news conferences in Philadelphia early in the day, with Mr. Trump’s supporters insisting his lead would hold statewide and the city’s Democrats, led by former Representative Robert A. Brady, unveiling an analysis of the remaining vote count that concluded Mr. Biden would win Pennsylvania convincingly.

As Georgia’s absentee ballots were counted early Friday, particularly in Clayton County, Mr. Biden pulled ahead in the state with 1,097 more votes.

Mr. Biden’s late surge in this year’s count, thanks to his dominance in Atlanta, Savannah and the increasingly Democratic-friendly suburbs around both, transformed the competition in a traditionally Republican-leaning state into one of the closest contests in the nation.

Georgia’s Republican Party has said it plans to bring up to a dozen lawsuits in the state.

In Arizona, Mr. Biden’s lead was significantly less than it was on election night. There are over two hundred thousand ballots left to count, with many coming from Phoenix’s Maricopa County.

Officials in Maricopa said they would post another report on Friday morning.

“We’re plugging along and making it happen,” said Adrian Fontes, the Democrat who oversees elections in the county. 

The vote count in Maricopa has grown tense, however, since several armed protesters showed up at the county office Wednesday night. On Thursday afternoon, about 200 supporters of Mr. Trump also gathered in front of the headquarters of the Arizona Republican Party after a protest earlier in the day involving about 50 Trump supporters dissipated in front of City Hall in Phoenix.

Some in the crowd held signs reading “Don’t Steal Elections,” “Shame on Fox News” and “Recall Fontes.” (Fox News called Arizona for Mr. Biden on Tuesday night, inflaming Trump supporters.)

Mr. Biden led by just over 11,000 votes in Nevada, but local officials in Las Vegas announced Thursday that 51,000 ballots from Clark County there were being tallied and would be announced Friday. Mr. Biden was winning the county by about eight percentage points. If he wins the bulk of the new votes, it would make it almost impossible for Mr. Trump to take the state, because about 70 percent of Nevada’s voters live in Clark County.

As part of the effort to sow doubt on the state’s election, Mr. Trump’s Nevada state director sent a letter to supporters on Thursday asking them “to go on camera/on the record with the issues they faced voting this election” to “expose issues we are seeing at polling locations/clerks offices.”

For its part, publicly and privately, the Biden campaign spent much of Thursday trying to tamp down expectations about the certainty of results in individual states, even as his supporters were on edge when the margins turned out to be far closer than many had expected.

In a briefing with reporters, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, acknowledged that his leads in Arizona and Nevada might tighten or otherwise fluctuate. It was a departure from her position the day earlier when she referred to a “historic victory in a place like Arizona,” though she still expressed optimism about victories in both states.

“We do expect, similar to Nevada, that some of the margin will continue to close today,” she said of Arizona, a state she has focused on for months. “The story of Arizona is one where Joe Biden is going to win, but it’s going to take us time and patience as we go through the counting.”

“The story of today,” she said at another point, “is going to be a very positive story for the vice president, but also one where folks are going to need to stay patient and stay calm.”

"After a Big Trump Win, ‘It’s Really Hard to Argue Florida Is a True Swing State’","LARGO, Fla. — Cliff Gephart, the co-owner of a Trump-themed coffee shop called Conservative Grounds, looked across the guns mounted on the wall, the cappuccinos in paper cups and the replica of the Oval Office he built against the back of the cafe, complete with a reproduction of the Resolute Desk. It was Tuesday, and Mr. Gephart, 50, was in a good mood.

“Let me ask you a question,” he shouted to a dozen or so patrons. “After the election, win, lose or draw, are you still coming here?”

“Yes!” the crowd shouted back.

It was not just inside the coffee shop: The state of Florida is feeling Trumpy.

Nationally, the presidential race is still too close to call. But President Trump has at least won his adopted home state again, and not by one of those nail-biting margins so typical of Florida. This year, the president secured what was effectively a landslide here, winning by more than three percentage points, over twice his margin in 2016.

After a series of demoralizing defeats — the presidential race in 2016, contests for the Senate and governor in 2018 and now another presidential vote — Democrats are reckoning with a dispiriting question: Will Florida ever go blue again?

“It’s really hard to argue Florida is a true swing state,” said Matthew C. Isbell, a Democratic data strategist in South Florida. “It’s not Missouri. It’s not Ohio, where Trump won by eight points. It’s just more modestly Republican — kind of like North Carolina, but even a little further to the right.”

Even Georgia, as it turns out, is more of a battleground.

Mr. Trump drove up his score in Miami-Dade County, shocking Democrats with his gains among conservative-leaning Cuban-Americans, who voted in such big numbers that the G.O.P. captured two Democratic-leaning congressional seats and a slew of state legislative districts.

“We’re not leftists, as Cubans,” said Gloria Davis, 59, a Republican who voted for Mr. Trump in Miami. “I see the leftists in the Democrat Party. He has what it takes to be president, and he’s a strong man. You can’t be weak in this nation.”

More concerning for Democrats, however, was that Mr. Trump also did better than four years ago across the state with non-Cuban Hispanic voters, who tend to lean more liberal. Exit polls conducted for the National Election Poll showed Joseph R. Biden Jr. falling short of 60 percent statewide with Hispanic voters, down from the two-thirds captured by Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Luis Ruiz, 60, who is Colombian-American and registered without party affiliation, said he voted for Mr. Trump despite his disappointment in the president’s leadership during the pandemic. Mr. Ruiz, a resident of Miami, said Mr. Trump’s policy toward Latin America probably keeps left-wing governments in the region in check.

“Trump’s policy, in some way, benefits our countries,” Mr. Ruiz said.

As the results came in on Tuesday, vocal Democrats such as State Representative Anna V. Eskamani of Orlando, who is a member of her party’s more progressive wing, demanded a top-to-bottom rethinking of Democrats’ approach to political campaigns.

“There was a bloodbath in South Florida,” Ms. Eskamani said.

On Thursday, Terrie Rizzo, the chairwoman of the Florida Democratic Party, promised a “deep dive” into what had gone wrong.

Mr. Biden bested Mr. Trump in Miami-Dade County, but by a margin of only seven percentage points, performing worse than any Democratic presidential candidate since John Kerry in 2004. In 2016, Mrs. Clinton won Miami-Dade by nearly 30 points.

Mr. Biden improved on Mrs. Clinton’s performance in other places, including Duval County, home to Jacksonville; Seminole County, near Orlando; and Pinellas County, home to Largo, all of which flipped from Republican to Democratic. But those were modest gains at best, with Mr. Trump building on his lead even outside of vote-rich Miami-Dade.

Democrats had thought their chances had improved with Mr. Biden as their nominee. After all, he had been on the ticket with former President Barack Obama when he twice won Florida. But that was before the coronavirus pandemic froze Democrats’ efforts to register voters, campaign in person or lure Mr. Biden and his top surrogates to visit.

At the same time, Florida Republicans continued to do as they always do: register voters, knock on their doors and get their people to the polls. Mr. Trump also flew in frequently for rallies, including a boisterous event at midnight on Sunday near Miami that resembled a huge block party.

“Our data suggested that close to half of Trump voters that were going to vote were going to vote on Election Day,” said Ryan D. Tyson, a Republican pollster in Tallahassee whose surveys hewed closely to the final results in 2016, 2018 and this year. On Tuesday, “my math said that we had won the election at 11 a.m.,” he said. “Everything else was gravy.”

Florida Democrats require more infrequent voters, including immigrants and Black and Hispanic Americans, to turn out in big numbers to do well, which is far more difficult than the Republican game plan of depending on reliable, “high-propensity” voters. The Republican Party is also typically better funded, which is crucial in an expensive state with 10 television markets.

This year, not even a $100 million investment from Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, was enough to win the state. The effort began too late, according to several Democrats involved. By then, the Biden campaign and the party had failed to heed warnings about Mr. Biden’s troubles with Hispanics, hire specialized staff or bring on prominent figures to introduce Mr. Biden to the Latino community.

Democrats need a better, locally tailored message, several Democrats said. An amendment to the state Constitution raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour passed on Tuesday with 61 percent of the vote, but the party did not campaign on it, said John Morgan, the Orlando lawyer and political donor who financed the ballot measure.

“If you’re a Democrat in America and you’re on the fence about a living wage, then you need to move to the other party,” said Mr. Morgan, who is registered without party affiliation but contributed heavily to Mr. Biden. “The Florida Democratic Party is a joke.”

The Trump campaign in Florida essentially never ended after 2016, with the president traveling to the state throughout his term and shaping his Latin America policy with an obvious eye at winning votes in the Miami area.

But some Republicans cautioned that Florida’s changing demographics made it hard to count it as a reliable red state.

“We are making some inroads, but to say this is becoming less of a swing state is very hard when you have such fluidity in the people voting,” said Mark Gotz, the Republican Party chairman in St. Lucie County. “We love them to come down here and bring their money, but we would like to let them leave their voting habits where they came from.”

In Largo, Mr. Gephart, the coffee shop owner, has taken his calling to the Trump campaign with the gusto of a political evangelist.

He was an early supporter, attending one of Mr. Trump’s first rallies in Sarasota, where he was impressed by a diverse line that stretched on for blocks and by Mr. Trump’s dramatic arrival by helicopter.

Mr. Gephart organized what he called the “Mother of All Boat Parades” in the president’s honor this summer and is now trying to get it listed in the Guinness Book of World Records. He is even seeking to erect a bronze statue of Mr. Trump in the Golan Heights, a disputed territory controlled by Israel.

But it is Mr. Gephart’s coffee shop in Largo, west of Tampa, that encapsulates his vision of Florida: A space where wearing a MAGA hat, raising skepticism about a mask mandate or admiring the president is not an aberration but normal.

“We’ve heard stories of hats being taken off people’s heads, or drinks thrown in their faces,” he said. “That won’t happen here.”

The crowd in the cafe the day after the election sat glued to their phones watching for updates in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, expressing certainty that the president would prevail in them all. (By Thursday, Michigan and Wisconsin had been called for Mr. Biden.)

Dea Kotthaus, a recent transplant from Southern California, said Florida’s conservatives had allowed her to find the kind of like-minded neighbors that she didn’t have in the liberal cities where she previously lived.

After arriving six months ago, she began volunteering with conservative activists and spent the 15 days before the election waving flags as part of a group called Penny’s Trump Train. She stayed up well past 2 a.m. to watch Mr. Trump’s speech on election night.

“I didn’t get what MAGA was initially,” she said. “But now I get it.”

The Disinformation Is Coming From Inside the White House,"A disinformation push to subvert the election is well underway, and it is coming straight from President Trump and his allies. The goal: to somehow stop a victory by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., or, failing that, undermine his legitimacy before he can take office.

Mr. Trump’s false declaration of victory in the small hours of Wednesday morning quickly united hyperpartisan conservative activists and the standard-bearers of the right-wing media, such as Breitbart, with internet trolls and QAnon supporters behind a singular viral message: #StopTheSteal.

But its impact has become apparent far beyond the internet, with the theme dominating conservative talk radio and the prime-time lineup on Fox News. There, Trump-aligned hosts pressed the false notion that the vote counting in the crucial, still-undecided states was illegitimate — the sort of message that was drawing flags on Twitter and Facebook but flourishing elsewhere.

“How big of a mistake is it for the Democrats to have kind of a burn-it-all-down approach,” Laura Ingraham asked on her program Wednesday night, “to destroy the integrity of our election process with this mail-in, day-of-registration efforts, counting after the election’s over — dumping batches of votes a day, two days, maybe even three days after the election?”

The messaging was far blunter from the president himself, who used a Thursday evening briefing at the White House to reel off a series of baseless attacks on an election system he described as “rigged” by Democrats trying to “steal an election.” It was the continuation of a diatribe he had started earlier in the day with a tweet reading “STOP THE FRAUD!” that Twitter quickly flagged as containing information that “might be misleading.”

Mr. Trump and his campaign aides had long indicated that they would challenge any unwelcome result with charges that the election was being stolen through “voter fraud,” which is in fact exceedingly rare.

On Thursday, senior aides to Mr. Biden portrayed the disinformation push as part of a desperate, coordinated campaign that, in tandem with the president’s legal strategy to press lawsuits against election officials across the country, was intended to halt a count that seemed likely to end Mr. Trump’s presidency.

“This is part of a broader misinformation campaign that involves some political theater,” Bob Bauer, a senior adviser to Mr. Biden, told reporters. “All of this is intended to create a large cloud that it is the hope of the Trump campaign that nobody can see through. But it is not a very thick cloud, it’s not hard to see what they’re doing — we see through it; so will the courts, and so will election officials.”

If there was little indication that the disinformation push was helping the Trump campaign in court, where it was seeking to use small instances of worker error or technical fouls to challenge Democratic ballots, it nonetheless seemed likely to do one thing: persuade a large swath of American voters that any Biden presidency was being stolen through illegal and unconstitutional means.

“This country is too corrupt, I’m so angry,” said Min Liu, who drove down from New York City to join protests in Philadelphia supporting Mr. Trump. “The Democrats are cheating right now, and the people need to wake up.”

She was not alone. On Wednesday and well into Thursday, the media campaign was spilling into the real world with similar protests in Detroit, Phoenix and elsewhere. Some were led by notorious alt-right trolls, like Mike Cernovich, who rose to national prominence in 2016 pushing the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, a precursor to the QAnon movement that falsely claimed that powerful Democrats were running a child-trafficking ring out of the basement of a Washington pizza restaurant that, in reality, has no basement.

Now, Mr. Cernovich is pushing a message of widespread election fraud in lock step with the president, his children and well-established members of his inner circle, like his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani.

Taken together, the media activity and the protests were emerging as a national and online version of the “Brooks Brothers riot” in the aftermath of the 2000 presidential election, when preppy Republican operatives, claiming fraud, stormed the Miami-Dade County canvassing board in Florida and effectively halted recount efforts that were expected to benefit the Democratic candidate, Al Gore.

A “Stop the Steal” Facebook page, created on Wednesday to help organize groups to flood ballot-counting centers with “observers,” quickly amassed nearly 300,000 members before the social network stepped in and shut it down on Thursday afternoon. Facebook said it saw worrying calls for violence in the group, which was “organizing around the delegitimization of the election process.”

The Facebook page was started by a Republican activist named Kylie Jane Kremer. It followed on a “Stop the Steal” group, with a similar playbook, created in 2016 by Roger J. Stone Jr., the self-described Republican dirty trickster and Trump confidant. (Mr. Stone was convicted on charges stemming from the Russia investigation but had his sentence commuted by Mr. Trump.)

Mr. Biden’s aides said later in interviews that they did not believe that anyone beyond Mr. Trump’s most die-hard supporters would question the legitimacy of a Biden victory. They pointed to statements from prominent Republicans dismissing Mr. Trump’s unsubstantiated attacks on the voting system. And they said they were heartened by a striking split at Fox News: While its prime-time hosts have parroted elements of Mr. Trump’s unfounded missives, its decision desk has not been shy in calling states for Mr. Biden, and several of its journalists have challenged dubious claims by Mr. Trump and his supporters.

The president and his allies have nonetheless relied heavily on the broader conservative media ecosystem to lob accusations against election officials, and then quickly moved to amplify them.

On Wednesday, the president shared two articles from Breitbart on Twitter. One falsely claimed that officials in Detroit had barred ballot-counting observers, even though both campaigns had the maximum number of observers allowed inside the building. Another Breitbart post shared by the president rounded up criticism from conservative influencers on social media of Josh Shapiro, the Democratic attorney general of the still-contested state of Pennsylvania, as evidence of calls for him to “step aside.”

Searches related to the keywords “steal” or “stealing” in the context of the election had more than 1.2 million mentions across social media platforms from 11 a.m. Tuesday to 11 a.m. Thursday, according to Zignal Labs, a firm that monitors disinformation. Michigan was leading the way with more than 96,000 mentions, followed by Pennsylvania at roughly 80,000 mentions and Arizona at just over 46,000.

Followers of QAnon, the convoluted pro-Trump conspiracy theory that falsely claims that the president is fighting a deep-state cabal of Democratic Satanist pedophiles, were eagerly joining in with claims of election fraud. It fit their imagined narrative perfectly — only widespread fraud by the deep state could defeat Mr. Trump, a man whom many QAnon followers venerate as something akin to divine.

There were indications that at least some parts of the campaign were planned in advance of Election Day.

A young conservative activist, John Doyle, who runs a YouTube channel called Heck Off, Commie!, was circulating a Google doc that encouraged people to head off the purported fraud in Pennsylvania and lobby state legislators “to cast their electoral votes as Republican!” The document, which listed the names and numbers of all the state’s legislators, was created on Tuesday — that is, before the president or his allies were claiming the election was being stolen in Pennsylvania.

Mr. Doyle did not respond to a request for comment, and his Twitter account, @ComradeDoyIe, was suspended on Thursday for violating the platform’s terms of service. Mark Levin, a popular conservative radio host and ardent Trump supporter, echoed Mr. Doyle’s call for Republican state legislators to disregard the outcome of the voting. In a tweet on Thursday, he wrote: “REMINDER TO THE REPUBLICAN STATE LEGISLATURES, YOU HAVE THE FINAL SAY OVER THE CHOOSING OF ELECTORS, NOT ANY BOARD OF ELECTIONS, SECRETARY OF STATE, GOVERNOR, OR EVEN COURT. YOU HAVE THE FINAL SAY.”

Dozens of other Twitter accounts pushing the hashtag #StopTheSteal were created in October and the first few days of November. The use of freshly created social media accounts to amplify a message is a common feature of disinformation campaigns.

By Wednesday, the hashtag had quickly jumped from the hard-right of the internet to mainstream Republicans. The Philadelphia Republican Party picked up the hashtag in a tweet, tagging Eric Trump, the president’s son, and Mr. Giuliani, and urging them to “get ready to #StopTheSteal and deliver Pennsylvania” to the president. 

Eric Trump went even further. He posted and then quickly deleted a tweet using the hashtag on Thursday and asking, without evidence, why the F.B.I. and the Justice Department were not stepping to stop election fraud. Jeanine F. Pirro, the popular Fox News personality, tweeted a similar thought.

A day earlier, Eric Trump had posted a video purporting to show ballots that had been cast for his father in Virginia Beach, Va., being burned. City officials later said that the ballots were clearly samples and not real. But even before that, the video’s questionable provenance probably should have been a tipoff that it was fake: It came from a Twitter user who goes by the handle @Ninja_StuntZ and is connected to the troll-infested message board 8kun. 

Mr. Ninja — or is it Mr. StuntZ? — appears to spend his days selling 8kun-branded coffee. By Thursday morning, his Twitter account had been suspended and the video was no longer available.

The relentless messaging and noise appeared to drive the campaign’s legal strategy. On Thursday morning, with the president’s slim lead in the key state of Pennsylvania growing slimmer, Pam Bondi, the former attorney general of Florida, and Corey Lewandowski, a close political adviser, held a news conference amid dueling protests outside the Philadelphia convention center, the city’s main ballot-processing site.

Lining 12th Street and protected by police barricades were dozens of protesters supporting Black Lives Matter and Democrats’ call to “count every vote.” On the opposite corner along Arch Street were roughly two dozen Trump supporters, chanting back to “count every legal vote.”

Ms. Bondi entered through the back of a barricade and stood in the middle of the Trump supporters, holding up a printed-out court order permitting the Trump campaign poll watchers to get closer to observe the ballot counting.

But her speech was drowned out by protesters across the street, who were armed with a D.J. and a full P.A. system blasting “Party” by Beyoncé. The D.J., counting to 10 repeatedly, in rhythm, was the only audible voice during Ms. Bondi’s remarks. As she continued, he broke into a chant: “Count, Philly, Count.”

A Big Win for Democrats in California Came With a Gut Check for Liberals,"OAKLAND, Calif. — The message that California voters sent in the presidential election was unequivocal: With almost two-thirds of ballots counted so far going for Joseph R. Biden Jr., the nation’s most populous state put up mammoth numbers for the Democrats. But dig a little deeper into the results and a more complex picture of the Golden State voter emerges, of strong libertarian impulses and resistance to some quintessentially liberal ideas.

In a series of referendums, voters in California rejected affirmative action, decisively shot down an expansion of rent control and eviscerated a law that gives greater labor protections for ride-share and delivery drivers, a measure that had the strong backing of labor unions. A measure that would have raised taxes on commercial landlords to raise billions for a state that sorely needs revenue also seemed on track for defeat.

The full force of the election results provided something of a gut check for liberals in a state that plays a big role in the Democratic Party and often offers insights into where the rest of the nation might be headed.

“The results in California show the Democrats that you can go too far,” said Bob Shrum, a former Democratic strategist and the director of the Dornsife Center for the Political Future at the University of Southern California. “California is a very liberal state that is now resistant to higher taxes and welcoming to the new gig economy, which is where the industry was created.”

That is not to say California is lurching rightward. The state is unwaveringly Democratic up and down the ranks of its government. Democrats have a supermajority in the Legislature, and the governor and lieutenant governor are Democrats. Even the state’s chief justice, Tani Cantil-Sakauye, quit the Republican Party two years ago and became an independent.

Pockets of unambiguous liberalism stayed strong on Tuesday with San Francisco voters saying yes to liberal priorities including affordable housing, police oversight and new taxes on companies whose highest-paid manager makes more than 100 times the level paid to its local workers.

And on many ballot measures, California voters validated the state’s liberal reputation. They rejected an expansion of penalties for some crimes and restored voting rights for felons who are on parole, securing the state’s position as a national leader in reducing mass incarceration and reforming its criminal justice system.

This year’s mixed results, however, were not an anomaly. California has always had competing impulses. The state that is home to Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, also produced icons of conservatism including Ronald Reagan. Some of the most prominent conservative voices during the Trump presidency hail from California, including Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader; Devin Nunes, the outspoken congressman and staunch Trump ally; and Stephen Miller, the hard-line anti-immigration White House adviser.

This has put California on the front lines of many political battles. The affirmative action measure on the ballot this year, for example, dated to 1996. That year, 55 percent of the state’s electorate voted to ban the use of race, ethnicity, national origin or gender in public hiring, contracting and university admissions.

The proposition that California voted on this time would have repealed the ban and was supported by a who’s who of the Democratic Party in the state, including Kamala Harris, the senator and vice-presidential candidate. But it was defeated by almost the same margin with which it had passed originally.

Analysts saw a reflection of the state’s demographic complexity in the vote.

“It’s always difficult to do proposition campaigns in a state of 40 million people,” said Anthony Rendon, a Democrat and the speaker of the California Assembly. “But our racial and ethnic groups are more complicated and divided than they used to be, in a bunch of different ways.”

Since 2014, no one racial or ethnic group has constituted a majority of California’s population. Thirty-nine percent of California residents are Latino, 37 percent are white, 15 percent are Asian-American, 6 percent are Black and fewer than 1 percent are Native American or Pacific Islander, according to the 2018 American Community Survey.

Against that backdrop, Mr. Rendon said, affirmative action is difficult to define, with different meanings to different generations, ethnic groups and income brackets. In most of the state’s working-class, inland counties, Californians voted to keep it banned. Only wealthier, left-leaning urban areas such as Los Angeles and the Bay Area supported bringing racial and ethnic preferences back into the public sector.

And in statewide polls, Latino voters expressed ambivalence — one survey done shortly before the election showed that only 40 percent of the state’s Latinos supported the proposition. Many white and Asian-American Californians opposed the measure, fearing that higher admissions for underrepresented minorities might mean less room for their own children in the University of California system. Some young voters did not even understand the concept, Mr. Rendon said.

That complexity extends to the state’s Democratic majority, Mr. Rendon added. “When the left is united in California,” he said, “we win.” But on issues from bail reform to rent control, he said, the party’s factions — progressive, moderate, coastal, inland — “were not all on the same page” this election year.

The way voters approached taxes was also nuanced. Local ballot initiatives were set to generate at least $15 billion in new bond authorizations, according to the California Local Government Finance Almanac. But the biggest tax question of the election — whether to raise property taxes on corporations and other large landowners — looked headed for defeat.

For all their liberal leanings on issues like the environment, California voters have long been less welcoming to new taxes than their reputation would suggest. For 40 years the pillar of local finance has been Proposition 13, the 1978 measure that limited local property taxes and has been considered politically untouchable ever since.

Expecting a Democratic wave, a coalition of public employees’ unions and progressive groups targeted 2020 as a moment to peel back part of the law. Their measure, Proposition 15, would have removed the Proposition 13 tax limits on commercial properties like office buildings and industrial parks, continuing to shield homeowners while raising an estimated $6.5 billion to $11.5 billion a year for public schools and local governments. The measure was trailing on Thursday, suggesting that, even if it wins, close to half of voters remain fiercely protective of Proposition 13.

California is unique in its reliance on direct democracy to decide some of the most crucial issues of the day. Ballots bulge with so many initiatives they might be better described as booklets. And it is not just ideology or the zeitgeist that can determine the outcome. Corporate interests, wealthy donors and advocacy organizations spend what amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars on initiatives every election.

The proposition that repealed the labor protections for ride-share and delivery drivers saw more than $200 million in campaign spending, breaking national records for a ballot initiative.

More than $100 million was also spent on another hot-button measure, rent control. Polls showed that the housing crisis was the No. 1 concern for state voters, and Gov. Gavin Newsom dedicated the bulk of his State of the State speech to the state’s worst-in-the-nation homeless problem. And yet voters up and down the state resoundingly rejected efforts to expand tenants’ rights and rent control.

The most prominent example was the failure of Proposition 21, a ballot initiative that would have given local governments more leeway to cap rental rates but was decisively defeated, according to The Associated Press. That marked the second time in two years California voters have rejected rent control by wide margins, and for the most part local attempts have not fared any better: On Tuesday, voters in Sacramento and Burbank also rejected rent control proposals.

“I keep thinking of this house I saw in a pretty affluent neighborhood that had a ‘Biden Harris’ sign and ‘No on 21’ sign,” said Tony Roshan Samara, program director of land use and housing at Urban Habitat, a Bay Area policy and advocacy organization. “That captures it. People will vote Democratic but when it comes to these issues of land and property, they vote in the interest of landowners.”

Californians are sometimes described as moderate on fiscal matters but liberal on social ones. That seemed mainly consistent with the passage of a number of criminal justice measures, perhaps most importantly the rejection of an initiative that would have made it harder for people convicted of certain felonies to be considered for early release from prison.

Jerry Brown, the state’s former governor, called the vote a “decisive repudiation” of punitive sentences and a “milestone” in California’s evolution from the 1980s and 1990s, when the state, amid crime waves and the crack epidemic, led the way on mass incarceration.

“There’s a lot of work to be done in this field, but California is showing the way in a very positive and I think creative way,” Mr. Brown said.

Mr. Brown spent $1 million left over from his campaign funds to defeat the measure, which was supported by police unions and get-tough-on-crime politicians and would have reimposed restrictions on early releases and toughen sentences for certain crimes.

What do voters think about voting for Democrats and at the same time not supporting Democratic-led initiatives? José Legaspi, a Los Angeles resident who runs shopping centers in Latino communities across the country, said he hardly saw a contradiction. He voted for Mr. Biden and did not think twice about opposing the measure that would raise taxes on commercial properties.

“I truly believe in paying taxes,” he said. “However there is a point at which one should limit how much more in taxes one should personally pay.”

"In a Year of Protest Cries, Now It’s ‘Count Every Vote!’ and ‘Stop the Steal!’","PHOENIX — In downtown Portland, Ore., they shouted, “Count every vote!” At the Detroit convention center, they urged those tallying ballots to stop. And outside a Philadelphia vote-counting site, they said they just wanted to watch.

In a year defined by protests — for women’s rights and Black lives, against coronavirus lockdowns and police brutality — the presidential election brought even more demonstrators to the streets across America this week as days passed without a clear winner.

As Joseph R. Biden Jr. appeared to gain ground over President Trump in the race to reach 270 electoral votes, protests broke out in hotly contested areas including Detroit, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Phoenix, where demonstrators said they were convinced the election was being stolen — a baseless claim that has circulated fiercely on social media, including on the Twitter feed of President Trump.

Protests also took place in areas where the results were settled, like New York, Portland, Washington and Miami, where the organizers — Latino Republican groups — offered a warning on a Facebook page called Stop the Steal: “They’re trying to steal this election from the President Donald J. Trump and we’re not going to let it happen.”

While sometimes tense — in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, the registrar said he had requested extra security at the election headquarters — the protests attracted a modest turnout.

But the effort may be just ramping up: The Stop the Steal Facebook page, a public group started by Trump supporters, mushroomed to more than 360,000 members within hours, before it was shut down by Facebook. It had been teeming with conspiracy theories and demands to halt the vote-counting process.

Mr. Trump has long been laying the groundwork for doubts about the election results, saying without evidence that mail-in ballots were fraudulent and the election would be rigged. Several protesters spoke of “illegal votes” and said they simply did not believe that Mr. Biden could have won in their state.

Republicans have complained that observers have been kept too far from counters to inspect ballots and ensure accuracy. In Philadelphia, Trump surrogates won a minor victory when a state appellate court ordered that observers be allowed to watch from six feet away instead of the previous 20 feet at the main Philadelphia canvassing area. Counterprotesters outside danced and wore shirts that said “Count Every Vote.”

In Atlanta, some 60 people gathered downtown with signs that read “No cheating” and “Four more years.” Drivers in cars passing by held their horns down in support and waved flags out of their windows.

“We want every legal vote to be counted,” said Chandler Crump, 16, a high school student from Atlanta. “I feel amazing being here. There’s a lot of patriotic proud American energy here.”

Simone Michaud, a stay-at-home mother from Marietta, an Atlanta suburb, said she was there to “represent women of color and females in general,” adding, “we have one of the best presidents.”

In Phoenix, about 50 protesters hoisted Trump signs and chanted “Stop the steal” outside City Hall. Several in the crowd were openly carrying rifles and handguns as police officers looked on.

“I’m here to tell the left there’s no way in hell they’re taking my guns,” said Josh Dawl, 35, who had both a .22 caliber rifle and a Winchester Model 1894 rifle. “Trump supports our constitutional rights. Biden does not.”

The protest in Phoenix on Thursday came as election officials scrambled to finish counting ballots. It followed a demonstration Wednesday night that was convened by Mike Cernovich, a far-right blogger and YouTube personality. At that protest, armed right-wing demonstrators repeatedly threatened journalists, to the point where sheriff’s deputies moved television crews inside the Maricopa County Elections Center.

On Thursday, Dale Williams, 70, a retired real estate broker, said he showed up to voice opposition to what he described as a Democratic attempt to steal the election, a claim that is not supported by facts.

“I absolutely believe Donald Trump won Arizona and won the country,” said Mr. Williams, who was carrying a concealed handgun that he brandished to a reporter. “We cannot let Democrats get away with fraud.”

Outside the convention center in Detroit, where absentee ballots were being counted, a lone Black Lives Matter protester took a knee in the street, blocking an S.U.V. that was decked out in Trump flags and towing a human-sized Statue of Liberty, with a sign that said, “Build the wall.”

The kneeler, Angelo Austin, who wore a mask that said “Detroit,” exchanged heated words with the demonstrators and blocked the S.U.V. until the police asked him to move.

“We’re still fighting to breathe,” he said, yelling at the group while some Trump supporters called him racist and raised their voices, telling him: “It’s not about race.”

Mr. Austin, who is Black, scoffed. “My grandparents helped build this city,” he said, adding that most of the people who showed up to contest the votes were from outside of Detroit. 

Many at the rally said that as they watched the votes come in from Detroit on Wednesday — helping flip the state of Michigan to Biden — they increasingly thought election fraud had been committed. 

“The MAGA army is not going to let our vote, democracy, be stolen,” said Mark Conway, 61, who had driven from Macomb County on Wednesday after hearing on the radio that Republican poll watchers were needed.

He stayed at the center for several hours before leaving and returning with his son, only to be told that he could not re-enter. “They said that because of Covid, the capacity was reached,” he said.

Entry was “temporarily frozen” with more than 550 election challengers, half of them Republicans, already inside the center, a city official said.

Mr. Conway remained outside until about 9 p.m. Wednesday. After dark, the challengers demanded that the poll workers stop counting the votes, and sporadic chants of “Let us in” broke out.

Mr. Conway returned Thursday morning to continue to support Mr. Trump. “We want every legal vote counted, and I believe that he got more legal votes than anybody has ever gotten,” Mr. Conway said, adding that the shift in Mr. Biden’s favor overnight, as more votes were counted, wasn’t “credible.”

“The polls were fake, the news was fake, the votes are fake, and the candidate is fake,” he said.

Becky De Nooy came to the rally from Grand Rapids with her daughter, Emma, and said she, too, was distrustful of what she viewed as a surge of ballots suddenly showing up for Democrats.

“That should be suggesting that there’s something amiss,” Ms. De Nooy, 49, said. Her daughter added: “Not having a fair election, we cease to be a democratic republic.”

Across the country, there were also people who took to the streets out of alarm for Mr. Trump’s claim of victory before the votes had been counted.

In Washington, there were newly installed cement vehicle barriers at the Black Lives Matter plaza near the White House, signaling that the city was preparing for larger crowds in an area where demonstrators have been watching results trickle in on a large screen.

A brief standoff broke out on Thursday afternoon outside of the Republican National Committee headquarters between dozens of Trump supporters and a small group chanting “Black lives matter.”

As the police set up a barricade, the president’s supporters responded by yelling “legal votes matter,” “all lives matter” and “does your life matter?”

Flor Cerrato, an accountant from Los Angeles in a pink Trump cap and red Trump mask, said she came to the protest because she believed that the president had “already won by landslide.”

“Why don’t they just let it go,” she said while holding a “Latinos-Americans 4 Trump” sign. “They’re trying to switch the numbers around.”

Republican leaders appeared at some protests reviving oft-used claims of irregularities that have in the past been debunked or shown to be greatly exaggerated. Outside a nondescript warehouse in North Las Vegas where most of the uncounted votes in Clark County remain, they erected a podium in the street.

Broadcasting on a hastily announced livestream, the former Nevada attorney general, Adam Laxalt, said Republicans had filed a lawsuit after discovering evidence of dead people and out-of-state voters illegally casting ballots in Nevada — but he did not provide any specifics to support those claims.

“We’re asking the judge to, due to all of these irregularities, to stop the counting of improper votes,” he said.

Mr. Laxalt was joined by Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, and Ric Grenell, former acting director of national intelligence.

Dozens of flag-waving Trump supporters looked on, and trucks with Trump flags circled the block, some gunning their engines and honking their horns.

Mr. Grenell refused to answer questions, telling reporters, “Listen, you are here to take in information.” As reporters shouted questions, the speakers got into a van and drove away.

We’ll Get There,"[Live updates on Biden and Trump.]

Remember when I told you to exhale? I think that was yesterday, though time has folded into an electoral map.

Well, are you still breathing? Good.

It’s been a rough day. We’ve laughed, we’ve cried, we’ve panic-refreshed our screens and we’ve eaten a whole lot of gummy worms. (Wait, is that just me?)

But, just for a minute, let’s look at the situation in a slightly different way: Democracy is messy, but so far it seems to be working.

At least 159.8 million Americans cast ballots, according to a projection by NBC News, which would amount to the highest turnout rate since 1900. Votes are being counted. Carefully. And we may know who our next president is within days, if not earlier.

Like I said, take a breath.

I suspect that tonight you just want to know what every American wants to know: Who is going to win this thing?

With Wisconsin and Michigan moving into Joe Biden’s column this afternoon, the road to 270 electoral votes is getting narrower for President Trump.

As of 8:45 p.m. Eastern time, Mr. Biden had 253 electoral voters, while President Trump had 214. Seventy-one remained on the map.

Three of those are in Alaska, which are likely to go to Mr. Trump. For the sake of the scenarios we’re about to lay out, let’s just assume Alaska falls in his column.

That leaves five states up for grabs: Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.

For Mr. Trump, there is no getting around a simple mathematical fact: To win, he must nab Pennsylvania. But that state alone isn’t enough. To reach 270, Mr. Trump must pick up Georgia and two additional states.

So a Trump win looks something like this: Pa. + Ga. + two of Ariz., Nev. & N.C.

For Mr. Biden, the math is much easier. He needs 17 more electoral votes. So, if he wins Pennsylvania, the race is over. He can also reach 270 by winning two of the other four states.

A Biden win looks like one of these scenarios: Just Pa. OR two of Ariz, Nev., N.C. & Ga.

Now, there’s one other possibility. Frankly, I hesitate to even mention it because it’s very unlikely but also very likely to make you reach for another glass of wine.

Let’s call it the OMG scenario. If Mr. Trump wins Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona and North Carolina and Mr. Biden takes Georgia … we have a tie.

Yes, a tie. 269 to 269. Our founders in all their infinite wisdom created a system that wound up with an even number of total electoral votes. Yay!

I do not expect this to happen. The realistic takeaway from all this math? Right now, it is going to be much easier for Mr. Biden to win than Mr. Trump.

Making Sense of the California Voter,"[Read more on Joe Biden’s president-elect acceptance speech.]

Good morning.

While Californians waited anxiously on Wednesday for some kind of resolution to the presidential race, the results from the state’s 12 expensive and important ballot propositions gave us plenty to parse.

Proposition 16, the high-profile measure that would have reversed a longstanding state ban on affirmative action failed, even in deep blue California in a year defined by demonstrations over racism at the heart of all kinds of systems and institutions.

But Proposition 17, which will give people who are on parole for felony convictions the right to vote, passed, and Proposition 20, which would have increased penalties for some kinds of misdemeanors, failed — suggesting that there is support for racial equity measures if they hinge on criminal justice reforms.

[See results from all the California races here.]

And although homelessness and housing instability were dominant issues facing the state even before the pandemic made them worse, voters soundly rejected Proposition 21, which would have expanded cities’ ability to implement rent control.

Those are just a few examples, but you get the idea: The California voter is complicated.

“The way I explain it,” said David McCuan, a political-science professor at Sonoma State University and an expert on the state’s ballot initiative system, “is the California voter is a paradox wrapped in a contradiction that presents a dilemma.”

While some of the most important ballot propositions were still too close to call as of early Thursday morning, Mr. McCuan said that the way things were shaping up, the rate of passage — five or six out of a dozen propositions — was pretty typical for the state in recent history, since about 2012.

Vote totals so far, he said, have showed that there wasn’t significant “roll-off,” meaning that voters didn’t simply skip propositions they didn’t know much about.

Instead, he said, it suggests that voters were “selective” about the ballot measures they gave the green light. So issues and messages had to cut through a lot of noise to get serious consideration.

But how do obscure residential property tax rule changes, as laid out in Proposition 19, gain more traction with voters than higher profile changes to commercial property tax rules aimed at better funding ailing schools and local governments, as laid out in Proposition 15? Both were supported by Gov. Gavin Newsom and the state’s Democratic Party.

(Both are still too close to call, but Proposition 19 was ahead while Proposition 15 was trailing as of early Thursday.)

Of course there isn’t one single explanation and no two voters are alike.

But Mr. McCuan said that in the absence of clear partisan priorities, voters are left to gauge for themselves which initiatives reflect their values.

[Here’s what’s at stake in the key propositions and Congressional races.]

And in the privacy of the (proverbial) voting booth, what he referred to as a kind of “Jekyll and Hyde” California voter often emerges.

The California voter has “historically wanted good roads, good schools.”

At the same time, Mr. McCuan said, “there’s this notion of, ‘Don’t tax me, tax the person behind the tree.’”

In other words, California voters may, by and large, want well-funded schools and infrastructure and adequate housing for all. They simply aren’t willing to tax themselves to pay for those things.

[Read more about Proposition 15.]

That may explain support for Proposition 19, which would give Californians who are 55 or older a property tax break when buying a new home, and opposition to Proposition 15, which would raise property taxes for some commercial property owners.

Then in some cases there’s just a lot of money.

Proposition 22, the measure that gig companies like Uber and Lyft spent more than $200 million to get passed, bombarding voters with push alerts, mailers and ads assuring voters that drivers preferred to remain independent contractors rather than employees, “set a new threshold,” Mr. McCuan said.

At the heart of the measure was a fight between big companies and the state over a labor-backed law that required drivers to be given protections afforded to workers employed full time. Gig companies didn’t like the law and vowed early on to fight it.

“The money is important because it was so massive that it framed the debate,” he said.

Nationally, Mr. McCuan said, Proposition 22 will serve as a lesson — a playbook for other big companies seeking to shape regulation, for labor groups fighting them and for lawmakers who will be buffeted by both sides.

“I think it becomes a recipe, if you will,” he said. “And in that sense, it is very Californian.”

‘Count Every Vote’: Protests Over Ballot Tallies Sweep Through U.S. Cities,"[As he prepares to assume the presidency, Biden confronts the ultimate test of his approach to governing.]

PORTLAND, Ore. — Calling on election officials to “count every vote,” protesters marched through the streets of several American cities on Wednesday in response to President Trump’s aggressive effort to challenge the vote count in Tuesday’s presidential election.

In Minneapolis, protesters blocked a freeway, prompting arrests. In Portland, hundreds gathered on the waterfront to protest the president’s attempted interventions in the vote count as a separate group protesting the police and urging racial justice surged through downtown, smashing shop windows and confronting police officers and National Guard troops.

In Phoenix, about 150 pro-Trump protesters, some of them armed, gathered outside the county recorder’s office where a closely watched count of votes that could help determine the outcome of the election was being conducted.

At several points, protesters contended that Adrian Fontes, the county official who oversees elections in Maricopa County, was improperly failing to count some ballots and costing Mr. Trump votes in Arizona’s most populous county — although there was no evidence that any ballots had been improperly tossed.

Keely Varvel, Mr. Fontes’s chief deputy, said there were no plans to halt counting of the ballots because of the protest in front of the building. “We are still planning to finish up our scheduled ballot processing work and report out more results tonight,” Ms. Varvel said.

In Detroit, another group of pro-Trump poll watchers gathered earlier in the day outside a ballot-counting center, demanding that officials “stop the count” of ballots after the Trump campaign filed suit to halt the count in Michigan.

Mr. Trump claimed early on Wednesday that he had won the election long before key states had counted all their ballots. He spent much of the day asserting, without evidence, that people were trying to “steal” the election from him and cast doubt on the legitimacy of the many ballots sent through the mail because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Early on Thursday, Joseph R. Biden Jr. was only a handful of electoral votes from winning the election, and Mr. Trump’s campaign was mounting an aggressive legal effort to challenge the tally, filing lawsuits in Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania.

“It’s such a dangerous moment,” said Carol Carmick, 59, who said she joined the protests in Portland out of fears that Mr. Trump would try to stay in power even if he lost the election.

Protesters also gathered in Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere, some of them continuing the protests over racial justice and policing that have rocked the country since the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May. More demonstrations were scheduled for the coming days.

In Minneapolis, several hundred protesters angered over the president’s declarations marched onto Interstate 94, prompting the police to clear the roadway.

“Our focus is on not allowing Donald Trump to steal this election from the American people,” Nekima Levy Armstrong, a lawyer who was part of the protest, said in a phone interview from the freeway. She said that the protesters had halted traffic and that the police, some on horses, had begun to make arrests and were not allowing protesters to leave.

The Minnesota State Patrol said on Twitter that it was arresting protesters and that demonstrating on the freeway “is illegal and very dangerous for pedestrians and motorists.”

In New York, protesters held a peaceful demonstration in Manhattan earlier on Wednesday calling for every vote to be counted and for racial equality, but hostile clashes between a separate group of protesters and the police developed later on when they briefly shut down traffic in the West Village, and officers pushed protesters to the sidewalks and arrested at least 20 people.

In Portland, hundreds of people marched through downtown. “The Vote Is Over. The Fight Goes On,” one sign read. The crowd later stopped at a separate “Count Every Vote” rally along the waterfront, where speakers expressed fears that Mr. Trump, who lost decisively in Oregon, was trying to sabotage the election and prevent votes from being counted in other states.

A portion of the crowd proceeded through downtown, where some people smashed windows. At that point, dozens of police officers began chasing the crowd through the streets and declared a riot. Gov. Kate Brown had extended an emergency declaration earlier in the day, allowing her to activate the National Guard that joined Wednesday night’s operations. The authorities said they made 10 arrests.

The city has seen persistent protests since May, and many of the demonstrators have vowed to continue their actions to support racial justice and oppose police brutality no matter who wins the election.

More than a dozen protests against Mr. Trump’s efforts to stop votes from being counted were organized by Refuse Fascism. At the one in Seattle, a group of protesters yelled, “Every city, every town, Trump-Pence out now,” and “count every single vote.”

At the pro-Trump event in Phoenix, at least 150 people gathered in front of the State Capitol before marching to the Maricopa County Recorder’s Office.

“The only way Biden can win Arizona is through fraud,” said Jim Williams, 67, a welder who attended the protest. “I won’t accept a Biden victory. I don’t want to live under Communist rule.”

Some in the crowd chanted “Down With Fox,” reflecting the protesters’ ire at Fox News’s decision on Tuesday to call Arizona for Mr. Biden, a move that some other news outlets later followed.

"Armed Agents Are Allowed in Ballot-Counting Venues, Justice Dept. Tells Prosecutors","[Live updates on Biden and Trump.]

WASHINGTON — The Justice Department told federal prosecutors in an email early on Wednesday that the law allowed them to send armed federal officers to ballot-counting locations around the country to investigate potential voter fraud, according to three people who described the message.

The email created the specter of the federal government intimidating local election officials or otherwise intervening in vote tallying amid calls by President Trump to end the tabulating in states where he was trailing in the presidential race, former officials said.

A law prohibits the stationing of armed federal officers at polls on Election Day. But a top official told prosecutors that the department interpreted the statute to mean that they could send armed federal officers to polling stations and locations where ballots were being counted anytime after that.

The statute “does not prevent armed federal law enforcement persons from responding to, investigate, or prevent federal crimes at closed polling places or at other locations where votes are being counted,” the official, Richard P. Donoghue, told prosecutors in an email that he sent around 1:30 a.m. on Wednesday.

“Although federal law enforcement officers should act in cooperation with local partners as appropriate,” the statute does not prevent armed federal law enforcement officers from going to ballot-counting venues, Mr. Donoghue added.

A Justice Department spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment made before this article was published on Wednesday. A day later, a department official said in defending the email that it was intended only to make clear that federal law enforcement officials were available to help their state and local counterparts and that the department did not plan to send armed agents anywhere.

Mr. Donoghue, the No. 2 official in the office of the deputy attorney general, Jeffrey A. Rosen, sent his email about half an hour before Mr. Trump made reckless claims including falsely declaring himself the winner of the election and began calling for election officials to stop counting ballots.

“We want all voting to stop,” Mr. Trump said at the White House. He said, without offering details, that his campaign would “be going to the U.S. Supreme Court” over the election count. The Trump campaign said later in the day that it was filing lawsuits in multiple states, including Michigan, to halt or protest vote counts.

One state election official vowed to resist any interference or intimidation efforts by federal officials.

“Elections are a state matter, and we have authority as state officials over anyone trying to enter locations where ballots are being counted,” said Attorney General Maura Healey of Massachusetts. “Anything else is a radical reinterpretation of the law. States can handle elections, and we will ensure the people decide the outcome.”

The election has been both unusual and charged. A historic number of mail-in ballots, prompted by the pandemic, have slowed the work of local election officials who tally them. And Mr. Trump has for months stoked fears about the integrity of the vote and amplified unfounded conspiracy theories that slow-counting states could not be trusted, intensifying his baseless accusations as the count stretched on past Election Day and his opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., gained an edge in key states.

Attorney General William P. Barr also spent the months leading up to Election Day echoing the president’s dark warnings, claiming without evidence that the wave of mail-in ballots would lead to an unprecedented amount of voter fraud.

He cited one example of 1,700 falsified ballots that The Washington Post found to be false. A department spokeswoman blamed an inaccurate memo from an aide.

The new legal interpretation about armed officials at vote-counting locations appeared to be another example of the attorney general mirroring Mr. Trump’s public posture, former Justice Department officials said.

“This seems like a messaging tactic for the attorney general,” said Vanita Gupta, the acting head of the department’s Civil Rights Division under President Barack Obama. “Lawfully, the Justice Department can’t interfere in the vote count, enter polling places or take ballots, even in the course of an investigation.”

In instances where the department can secure access to ballots for any investigation, Ms. Gupta said that federal law allowed law enforcement officials to “copy and inspect, but that ballots stay in the hands of local election officials.”

Justice Department officials said this week that they expected lawyers for the Trump and Biden campaigns to take on court challenges related to the election, and that the Trump administration would have little, if any, role.

Election experts said that any effort by the Justice Department to blatantly interfere in the election would immediately prompt legal challenges. Still, armed officials arriving at ballot-counting locations even for investigatory purposes could intimidate or otherwise disrupt the process, they warned.

“The very strong, longstanding norm is that the federal government does not seek to do anything to interfere with a state’s ability to count votes and certify elections,” said Kristy Parker, an official in the department’s Civil Rights Division during the Obama administration."
"As States Fall His Way, Biden Vows ‘Every Vote Must Be Counted’ ","[Read our profile of Kamala Harris, the first woman elected U.S. vice president.]

After an extraordinary election night that put the country’s democracy to the test, the presidential election on Wednesday tilted toward Joseph R. Biden Jr., who claimed Wisconsin and Michigan and was leading in Nevada and Arizona, two states that will get him to 270 electoral votes if his advantage holds.

Top aides to both Mr. Biden, the Democratic nominee, and President Trump argued that they were on a winning trajectory. But Mr. Biden was far better positioned because he had more routes to victory among the seven battleground states that were still counting votes.

After a campaign finale that riveted the country and saw the highest level of turnout in over a century, Mr. Biden sought to balance a tone of conciliation with an attitude of confidence. In an afternoon speech in Wilmington, Del., he said that he believed he was on track to secure the presidency and that it would soon be time to “put the harsh rhetoric of the campaign behind us.”

While he did not claim outright victory the way Mr. Trump sought to do late on election night, Mr. Biden listed the states he had seized from the president and predicted that Pennsylvania would soon be among them.

“I’m not here to declare that we’ve won,” he said, “but I am here to report that when the count is finished, we believe we will be the winners.”

Mr. Biden also issued a warning to the Trump campaign, which was once again threatening to go to court to stop the counting of votes. 

“Power can’t be taken or asserted,” he said. “It flows from the people. And it’s their will that determines who will be the president of the United States, and their will alone.”

“Every vote must be counted,” Mr. Biden said, adding: “No one’s going to take our democracy away from us. Not now, not ever.”

The president had a weaker hand — and seemed to affirm as much throughout the day. First, Mr. Trump vented on Twitter that the tabulation of the mail-in ballots in Wisconsin and Michigan was “devastating in their percentage and power of destruction.” Then, his top aides simultaneously declared victory in Pennsylvania, even though the state had more than one million votes still to be counted. Later, supporters of the president as well as Republican operatives banged on the glass outside a vote-counting site in Detroit and, to no avail, chanted “Stop the count.”

Mr. Trump also took more serious steps toward contesting the election, deploying a legal team to mount a series of challenges against the counting of votes. In the hotly contested battleground of Pennsylvania, the Trump campaign asked the Supreme Court to be allowed to participate in a pending challenge to a three-day extension of the deadline for receiving absentee ballots in the state. The Supreme Court has not said whether it will hear the case.

The Trump campaign also announced it would request a recount in Wisconsin, and in Michigan it sought to halt the counting of votes so that it could arrange for better access for its election board observers.

But as one of the most unusual presidential elections in history stretched into its second, but not final, day of vote-counting, there was no indication that any state or locality would bow to the president’s demand that the process be halted. In an extraordinary interjection into the electoral process, Mr. Trump used an election-night speech from the White House to attack the integrity of the vote, and he kept up his barrage on Wednesday, amplifying baseless conspiracy theories about the accumulating tally for Mr. Biden, the former vice president.

Senior Democratic officials have been holding conversations with corporate executives and former Republican leaders about staging a sort of intervention if Mr. Trump refuses to accept the results of the election, according to a Democrat familiar with the planning.

But Republican leaders seemed to have little appetite for a protracted fight over the ballots, particularly as it became clear by the end of the day that Mr. Biden was well positioned to prevail.

“Every vote that was legally cast needs to be counted,” said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri. “America will once again serve as an example to the world.”

The Democrats made significant gains overnight in part because Republican officials in some states had refused to accommodate the shift toward voting by mail and allow such ballots to be counted before Tuesday. So in states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump had established an early lead that began to erode once absentee votes were tallied.

By Wednesday night, though, the electoral map more fully reflected the entirety of the votes in those states. In Michigan, for example, Mr. Biden was several hundred thousand votes behind on Tuesday night before absentee ballots closed the gap to 37,000 by Wednesday morning. The Associated Press declared him the winner of the state in the afternoon.

Mr. Biden, who focused his campaign on Mr. Trump’s mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic, was on the brink of capturing at least three states that the president carried in 2016, and perhaps as many as five or six if the last waves of ballot-counting strongly favored him.

In some of those states, Mr. Biden’s leads were no more formidable than the wispy margins that carried Mr. Trump into office four years ago, suggesting that the former vice president had managed to improve incrementally on Hillary Clinton’s performance. It was also clear that Mr. Biden was not able to build a coalition capable of delivering an electoral landslide. But he achieved two crucial victories in states that shattered Democrats’ hopes in 2016: Wisconsin, where The A.P. declared Mr. Biden the victor after he amassed a lead of nearly 21,000 votes, and Michigan, where the race was called after he established a 67,000-vote advantage.

Should Mr. Biden hold on to two other unresolved states where he was leading on Wednesday evening — Arizona and Nevada — it would be enough to give him exactly 270 Electoral College votes. That tally also includes one vote he won from Nebraska’s Second Congressional District, because that state does not have the winner-take-all system employed nearly everywhere else. 

There was also the potential for Mr. Biden to flip one or more of the states where Mr. Trump was ahead, most prominently Pennsylvania; the president was leading by less than 200,000 votes with hundreds of thousands of ballots left to count. The uncounted ballots were cast predominantly by mail and were expected to heavily favor Mr. Biden.

In Georgia, too, Mr. Trump’s thin lead did not appear wholly secure against votes that were being tabulated slowly in Democratic-leaning areas. But the president still had one or two clear paths to an Electoral College majority, albeit far fewer than his Democratic opponent. If Mr. Trump held on to the three states where he was ahead — Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina — he would need to overtake Mr. Biden in only one of the states where the former vice president was favored.

Advisers to Mr. Trump argued throughout election night and into Wednesday morning that The A.P. and Fox News had prematurely placed Arizona in Mr. Biden’s column. The Democrat had a lead of about 79,000 votes there, and there were several hundred thousand votes yet to be counted. Many of them appeared to be coming from Maricopa County, which had so far tilted toward the former vice president.

In Nevada, Mr. Biden was clinging to a lead of just 7,600 votes, but additional mail-in ballots were expected to somewhat improve his position.

If Mr. Biden held only a modest upper hand over Mr. Trump, the Democratic Party as a whole posted unexpectedly weak results in contests besides the presidential race. Though Democratic and Republican pollsters had predicted a gain of several seats in the House for Democrats — and perhaps as many as a dozen or more — the chamber seemed headed for the opposite outcome, with Republicans retaking a few conservative-leaning districts they lost in the 2018 midterm elections.

There was significant ticket-splitting, especially in the sort of high-income precincts where Republican strategists had feared an electoral shellacking from voters exhausted by Mr. Trump’s erratic conduct.

“They weren’t a fan of the president’s personality,” said Liesl Hickey, a Republican strategist who spent months conducting weekly focus groups with suburbanites. “But taxes and the economy led the list of their concerns, and they were terrified of their taxes being increased.”

Perhaps most disappointing to Democrats was the narrowing path they had in their effort to capture a majority in the Senate, even though they had a favorable map this year. The party took over two Republican-held seats, in Arizona and Colorado, while losing a seat in Alabama. 

But Republicans showed strong resilience in a number of races where Democrats had been hoping to make the gains required to take over the chamber, including in Maine, where Senator Susan Collins, a moderate who declined to endorse Mr. Trump for re-election, turned back her Democratic challenger with unexpected ease.

There was still some possibility that Democrats could overtake Republicans in the Senate, because of uncalled races in North Carolina and Alaska — both seats are now held by Republicans — as well as the potential for two runoff elections for Senate seats in Georgia. Because of the Southern state’s distinctive electoral procedures, there is a possibility that the Senate may be split almost evenly, with 50 seats held by Republicans and 48 held by Democrats, until Georgia holds a second round of voting in January.

The specter of a two-month clash for two seats in the same state to decide the Senate majority also raised the question about the state of the Republican Party should Mr. Trump lose the presidency. Republican strategists on Wednesday were already discussing how he might handle defeat, and whether he would be an asset or a liability in the Georgia races.

In Pennsylvania, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, a Democrat, said on Wednesday afternoon that he was confident Mr. Biden would claim victory in his state, irrespective of any Trump lawsuits. While Republicans were challenging the legitimacy of ballots that arrive by mail after polls close on Election Day, Mr. Fetterman said he did not believe Mr. Biden would need those votes to carry the state.

Mr. Fetterman, a possible candidate for governor or a Senate seat in 2022, said his party should reckon with Mr. Trump’s intense appeal to rural voters, and his ability “to drive margins in these small areas that are unprecedented.” But Mr. Fetterman took a dimmer view of Mr. Trump’s litigation threats and rhetorical attacks on the vote.

“It’s no different than some random guy screaming on the corner,” he said. “Just keep on walking.”"
Pennsylvania Remains Up for Grabs as Trump and Biden Assert Confidence,"PITTSBURGH — Pennsylvania, the state with the largest trove of electoral votes still up for grabs, inched ahead in its counting of more than one million outstanding mail-in ballots on Wednesday, a majority of them from Democratic strongholds, as Joseph R. Biden Jr. cut into his deficit with President Trump.

With narrow wins in Wisconsin and Michigan called on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Biden has flipped two of the three Northern industrial states that handed Mr. Trump the White House in 2016. Pennsylvania, the last of those so-called blue-wall states, loomed as a battleground that Mr. Trump must win again to secure re-election. Mr. Biden has a slightly broader path to attaining 270 electoral votes, but a Pennsylvania victory would put him over the top.

Officials from both parties vigorously made their cases that the composition of the uncounted mail-in votes ensured that a Pennsylvania victory was at hand for their candidate.

Democrats pointed to hundreds of thousands of uncounted ballots in Philadelphia and its suburbs, and to the fact that the mail-in votes had so far run four to one in Mr. Biden’s favor.

“Biden probably wins the state by roughly 100,000,” predicted Rich Fitzgerald, the Democratic county executive of Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh.

But Bill Stepien, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, argued that the urban and suburban ballots would give only 250,000 extra votes to Mr. Biden, who as of Wednesday evening trailed Mr. Trump by 192,380 votes, a three-percentage-point deficit that the former vice president had chiseled away at all day.

Mr. Stepien said that mail ballots in more conservative counties, including York, Butler and Blair, would cut into Mr. Biden’s margins. Both sides are maneuvering for a possible ballot-by-ballot legal fight if the race is extremely close.

They may all be waiting for a few more days. “We’re talking about a matter of days before the overwhelming majority of ballots are counted,” Kathy Boockvar, the secretary of state, said at a news conference on Wednesday night.

Lawyers for the Trump campaign, including the president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, have descended on the state to mount court challenges. Republicans have filed multiple lawsuits, questioning how voters were notified of issues with mail-in ballots and allowed to cast provisional ballots. Hearings were held both in Montgomery County, outside Philadelphia, and at the state level.

The Trump campaign also said it would file a suit to stop the counting of mail-in ballots, claiming election officials were not allowing party observers to closely monitor the process, particularly in Philadelphia. And the campaign moved to intervene in a case before the U.S. Supreme Court, hoping to stop ballots postmarked by Election Day, but received up to three days later, from being counted.

Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, condemned the legal maneuvers.

“Our election officials at the state and local level should be free to do their jobs without intimidation or attacks,” Mr. Wolf said in a statement. “These attempts to subvert the democratic process are disgraceful.”

If the race comes down to the wire, the fate of thousands of provisional ballots set to be counted next week might also be in play. Many voters who requested mail-in ballots but decided to vote in person instead and did not bring their mail ballots with them to be “spoiled,” or rendered unusable, were given provisional ballots, said Bethany Hallam, a member of the elections board of Allegheny County. At least one Republican lawsuit was filed to throw out certain provisional ballots, and Ms. Hallam expects more are coming.

Mr. Trump “sent his entire legal team to Pennsylvania to try to invalidate legal votes in whatever way possible,” Ms. Hallam said.

No matter who ends up winning the battle for Pennsylvania, the geography and the closeness of the race revealed a state pulling ever further apart along regional and partisan lines. Suburbs outside Philadelphia and Pittsburgh that once leaned Republican have become treacherous for the party under Mr. Trump, while blue-collar counties, where Democrats used to win election after election, have moved to the populist right.

Mr. Biden, a Scranton native whose pitch to Democrats was always that he could woo back white working-class voters, fell short of that goal. Although he slightly narrowed margins in rural counties compared with Hillary Clinton in 2016, Mr. Trump, who barnstormed through the state’s most conservative regions, brought out even more of his base.

In Washington County in southwest Pennsylvania, a region that benefited economically from fracking for natural gas, Mr. Biden won a slightly larger share of the vote than Mrs. Clinton did, 38 percent versus 35 percent. But with overall turnout up significantly, Mr. Trump won 9,300 more raw votes this year than he did in 2016, while Mr. Biden added only 7,650 additional votes. The pattern appears to have repeated across central Pennsylvania.

“There was no dropoff” for Mr. Trump from 2016, said Rob Gleason, a former chair of the state Republican Party, who lives in Cambria County in central Pennsylvania. “It’s pretty fantastic.”

Mr. Trump’s votes in the county rose by 6,000 over 2016. “He has a gift of getting people to be really for him,” Mr. Gleason said, describing the thousands who attended Trump rallies.

In Philadelphia, where the largest number of outstanding ballots in the state remained, election officials said they processed another 47,000 mail-in ballots on Wednesday, for a total of 233,486.

Lisa Deeley, a city commissioner, said that 347,000 in-person ballots had been counted, or 97 percent of those cast. She had no estimate of when the city would finish counting.

Democrats in the city, who had hoped for a significant Biden win, were partly dejected by the closeness of the race.

Fran Cardella, 77, a retired insurance industry worker in Philadelphia, said the narrowness most likely resulted from Mr. Trump’s large and frequent rallies in rural Pennsylvania in the closing days. A Biden voter, Ms. Cardella said the conservative rural counties showed as much enthusiasm for Mr. Trump as in 2016 when he won an unexpected, narrow upset in the state.

“I guess they like his rhetoric,” she said.

"Deprived of a Quick Decision, Democrats Seek a Narrower Path","[Joe Biden has won the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Read our story]

WILMINGTON, Del. — Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign team began Election Day believing that the candidate had multiple routes to 270 electoral votes, as some Democrats dreamed of a landslide.

A day later, it was clear that the path to victory would be narrower, slower and more challenging than many Democrats had hoped, in a vivid reminder of how deeply polarized the nation is and how difficult it has been for the party to secure the votes of some of the diverse constituencies it had courted.

“I thought we were going to have it all over at 10 o’clock last night,” said former Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida. “Obviously, not only was I wrong on Florida, but what happened to Florida has been happening to the entire country.”

Saying that he remained confident that Mr. Biden would ultimately win the presidency, he joked, “I am wearing sackcloth and ashes.”

Mr. Biden has a clear path to the presidency, despite President Trump’s false claims about his own standing in the race. Mr. Biden flipped Wisconsin and Michigan, Midwestern states that were central to Mr. Trump’s path. He is leading in Arizona, another state that for decades was a Republican stronghold but rejected the party under Mr. Trump’s stewardship.

Wins in Nevada, where Mr. Biden narrowly leads, and in Arizona would bring him to 270 electoral votes, the bare minimum number he needs to make him the 46th president of the United States. And on Wednesday night, Georgia was too close to call, too.

In a speech in Wilmington on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Biden said he would reach 270. “I’m not here to declare that we’ve won,” he said, “but I am here to report that when the count is finished, we believe we will be the winners.”

Yet the initial results on Tuesday and Wednesday indicated a far closer race in key states than many political observers — and the polls — had anticipated. Mr. Biden lost Florida, apparently by a bigger margin than Hillary Clinton did, while the outcome in Pennsylvania, long a top political and personal priority for Mr. Biden, remained uncertain, though there were signs it was moving his direction.

In his remarks in Wilmington, Mr. Biden sought to signal that he was already looking past the election as he emphasized the need for the country to come together once the results are in.

“I know this won’t be easy; I’m not naïve,” he said. “I know how deep and hard the opposing views are in our country on so many things. But I also know this as well: To make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as enemies. We are not enemies.”

Election night, however, underscored just how deep the divisions in the country are. A number of states that Democrats had been hopeful about — places like Ohio, Florida and even Texas, where Mr. Biden’s running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, campaigned — slipped out of range. And states where Mr. Biden was thought to have a comfortable lead, including Wisconsin and Michigan, were extremely close.

Ohio, Texas, Iowa, Florida and most likely North Carolina — all battlegrounds, all reaches for the campaign where it nonetheless made investments of the Democratic ticket’s time in the final week — remained Republican. It was a disappointment to some in Mr. Biden’s campaign who had hoped for an early night and an overwhelming rejection of Mr. Trump, even as they remained encouraged by news out of Arizona.

“Running the table in modern American politics is really hard,” said Representative Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio, who hung onto his seat in a part of the state that has become increasingly challenging for his party, and was optimistic about Mr. Biden’s chances over all.

Biden campaign officials had always said that they were seeking to create as many pathways to 270 electoral votes as possible, and Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, warned weeks ago that the race was closer than polls suggested.

“We were always clear that our initial pathway to victory was through the Upper Midwest,” Anita Dunn, a senior adviser to Mr. Biden’s campaign, said on Wednesday. “The goal was to get 270 electoral votes, and we feel very confident that after the votes have been counted, that’s where we’re going to be — above 270, which is how you win the presidency in this country.”

But on Tuesday, campaign officials had also entertained the prospect of having a clear picture of the results early, suggesting that Mr. Biden would give a presidential speech that hit notes of leadership and national unity that evening. Instead, given the close nature of many races, in a year where many Americans voted by mail in a pandemic, he gave only brief remarks in the early hours of Wednesday, urging patience.

An examination of election returns in battleground states showed trouble spots for Mr. Biden in a number of states, Florida perhaps above all else.

The campaign made a significant play for the state, a perennial battleground, deploying the Democratic ticket and former President Barack Obama there in recent days. But as Mr. Biden’s allies in the state had warned, and some inside his campaign had worried, he faced challenges with portions of the diverse Latino community there. And for months, party officials in the state said, he was not especially visible on the ground, while Trump voters were palpably energized.

“Their message, their implied ‘socialism with a Biden win,’ scared a lot of folks in the South Florida area,” State Senator Janet Cruz, a Democrat, said in a pre-Election Day interview. “I call it like a zipper effect: You start with a little issue, you zip it right open. And it worked.”

Mr. Biden won Hispanics in the state by only five percentage points, according to preliminary exit polls, a sharp decrease from four years ago, when Mrs. Clinton won among that group by 27 points.

In one of his most notable setbacks, Mr. Biden was leading by only seven points in Miami-Dade County, which has a majority Hispanic population and many Cuban-American residents, a steep drop from Mrs. Clinton’s 29-point margin four years ago. In Osceola County in Central Florida, which has a large Puerto Rican population, Mr. Biden was ahead by 14 points, a notable decline from Mrs. Clinton’s 25-point advantage there.

Other states show the limitations of Mr. Biden’s efforts to pry away white voters who supported Mr. Trump in 2016. In Iowa, many Trump-friendly counties moved further to the right. The same pattern could be seen in Ohio.

Yet he also appeared, in some states like Pennsylvania, to make gains with other voters, including moderates and independents.

“My friends, I’m confident we’ll emerge victorious,” Mr. Biden said Wednesday. “There will be no blue states and red states when we win — just the United States of America.”"
"In Midwest Battlegrounds, the Virus Met Another Concern: The Economy","KENOSHA, Wis. — When Americans voted in this presidential election, they made it clear that of all the crucial issues facing the country, the coronavirus pandemic towered over the rest.

They remained diametrically opposed, however, on how the pandemic reflected on President Trump.

In the Midwest — states that were battlegrounds in the presidential race and where the virus has soared — supporters of Mr. Trump defended his handling of the crisis, praised his efforts to revive the economy and echoed his suggestions that the virus’s dangers were overblown.

And on Wednesday, with all eyes on the election outcome, new records in Minnesota and Indiana pushed the country above 100,000 virus cases in a single day for the first time since the pandemic began.

Those who voted for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. frequently said that Mr. Trump’s response to the pandemic had given them one more urgent reason to vote him out.

“We need somebody in office who has a game plan,” said Gabrielle Young, a 30-year-old health care worker in Kenosha, Wis., who said she had never cared about politics in the past.

That changed this year. She said she was disgusted by Mr. Trump’s dismissal of masks and his shoulder-to-shoulder rallies, including one he hosted on the eve of the election in Wisconsin, a state Mr. Biden went on to narrowly win.

Then, Ms. Young said, there are Mr. Trump’s false promises of a national recovery from the coronavirus. “Trump keeps saying that the vaccine is ready, and the vaccine is not ready,” Ms. Young said. “You’re not giving us hope. You’re giving us false hope.”

In Ohio, where coronavirus hospitalizations are at a peak, Mr. Trump triumphed on Tuesday just as he did in 2016, sweeping northeastern counties that were once Democratic strongholds.

Mr. Trump’s supporters said they saw little reason to punish him for the pandemic, which has caused a crisis around the world.

“I’m not as afraid of Covid as I am of a bad economy,” said Ish Soltay, 51, of Avon Lake, a suburb west of Cleveland. His county, Lorain, which was once reliably Democratic, went for Hillary Clinton by 131 votes in 2016. On Tuesday, it appeared to surge further right, flipping to Mr. Trump, according to preliminary vote tallies.

Mr. Soltay, a retired critical care nurse who now sells portable oxygen machines, said he had been personally affected by the coronavirus, which infected his son and chipped away at his paychecks in medical sales. But his support for the president was stronger now than it was four years ago, he said, and on the day before the election, Mr. Soltay took a day off work to make his views known near an appearance by Mr. Biden in Cleveland, two Trump flags waving from the roof of his car.

“In the beginning, March, April, May time frame, I would say corona was a bigger issue for me,” said Mr. Soltay, who said he locked down inside his house in the spring, leaving to go to the grocery store and changing his clothes afterward. “By the time I was voting, if I had to rank them, economy was one to me.”

In the Midwest, coronavirus cases have surged dangerously and hospitals have neared capacity in recent days, leaving voters with even more reason to send a message about the pandemic. Even as coronavirus cases rose in states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio, closely related issues — the economy and shutdowns — were top of mind.

Twelve states around the Midwest added more cases in the seven-day period ending Tuesday than in any other week of the pandemic, a sign of the rapidly devolving situation in the center of the country as infections and hospitalizations continue to spike.

The situation is especially volatile in Wisconsin, which has for weeks been adding cases at one of the highest rates in the country. More than 35,000 infections have been identified over the last week, the most in any seven-day stretch of the pandemic. As of Wednesday morning, seven of the 20 American metropolitan areas with the most cases per capita in recent days were in Wisconsin.

Still, some Wisconsin voters said that while they were deeply worried about the pandemic, they were unsure whether they should have steered their support to Mr. Biden because of it.

Brenda Garcia, 63, recounted all the things she and her husband, who live in Kenosha, have missed since the pandemic hit. They have canceled three vacations and countless dinners with friends, children and grandchildren. In a few weeks, Thanksgiving will be a quiet affair: just the two of them.

Yet by Election Day, Ms. Garcia said she was not inclined to say that Mr. Trump had seriously erred in his handling of the pandemic.

“I think he should have taken it a little more serious,” she said as she left a neighborhood church that doubled as a polling place. “But I’m just not blaming anybody. We don’t know what Biden would have done. Who’s to say he would have done any better?”

The Midwest’s struggles with the coronavirus reach far beyond Wisconsin. Covid-19 cases have been rising sharply in Michigan, Ohio, Iowa and Minnesota, all relatively competitive states in the presidential race. The Omaha area, where voters awarded a single electoral vote to Mr. Biden, has been adding cases at record levels. And in Minnesota, more than 3,800 new cases were announced on Wednesday, shattering a record set a day earlier.

In downtown Cleveland on Wednesday, James Williams, 53, was getting off work from his job as a cook at a hotel and heading to a second job stacking boxes at a factory. Wearing a mask as he hustled to catch the bus, Mr. Williams said he cast his vote for Mr. Biden. His chief reason? “For the world’s safety,” he said, “because of this pandemic.”

Unemployment remains high in Cuyahoga County, and Mr. Williams said he had been set back for five months, scraping by with temporary jobs. He said his cousins caught the virus, as did friends.

“People fail to realize the economy is going to be there,” he said. “You can always reboot and rebuild the economy, but you can’t reboot and rebuild a nation of people.”

Some people saw a vote for Mr. Trump as a move toward normalcy, a way out of the coronavirus crisis and the restrictions that surround it.

As he stood outside his polling place at a recreation center in Waterford Township, Mich., on Tuesday, Robert Myers, 73, lamented that he had to wear a face covering.

Mr. Myers, who voted for Mr. Trump, said he approved of the way the president managed the coronavirus.

“He doesn’t try to push something on you that you don’t want,” he said. “The government has their nose enough in other people’s business.”

His greatest hope for the country? “Getting rid of these stupid masks,” he said while still wearing one.

False News Targeting Latinos Trails the Election,"[Joe Biden has won the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Read our story]

MIAMI — The posts proliferated on election night before anything remotely definitive was known about the results of the presidential race. “Robado,” they falsely repeated again and again in Spanish: President Trump was being robbed of a victory. He had won Arizona. George Soros was funding violent “antifa riots.”

The baseless social media messages to Latinos trying to delegitimize the election and the results for Joseph R. Biden Jr. circulated online on Tuesday night and into Wednesday, part of a disinformation campaign to undermine Latino confidence in the vote as it unfolded.

Ahead of Election Day, false news in Spanish tried to turn Latinos against Black Lives Matter and tie Mr. Biden to socialism, tactics that experts said could depress the Hispanic vote. Now that voting is complete, the rampant falsehoods have only garnered larger audiences — including among immigrants less familiar with the institutions of American democracy. The gist of the falsehoods is that the election is “rigged” against Mr. Trump.

“These misinformation narratives are helping plunge the country further into chaos and confusion,” said Fadi Quran, a director at Avaaz, a nonprofit that tracks disinformation. He called the disinformation campaigns a “democratic emergency.” “The most vulnerable communities in the country are paying the highest price,” he said.

For weeks, officials and election security experts braced for what was widely expected to be an election marred by hacking and misinformation. They zeroed in on familiar adversaries in Russia, which weeks earlier had been caught hiring people in Mexico and Venezuela to push out Instagram and Facebook content.

The officials and researchers worried about interference from Iran after Iranians posing as members of the far-right Proud Boys group threatened Democrats not to vote. The Justice Department on Wednesday announced a takedown of dozens of Iranian propaganda sites targeting Americans. And Microsoft and United States Cyber Command separately took aim at Russian cybercriminals’ hacking infrastructure in an effort to stave off the kinds of ransomware attacks that could freeze up election systems.

But on Tuesday, they breathed a sigh of relief as Election Day passed relatively unscathed. It was, one administration official said, just another Tuesday on the internet.

Yet 24 hours later, it appeared Facebook and Twitter might have overlooked the deluge of disinformation targeting Spanish-speaking Americans. Spanish-language accounts with huge followings falsely said that Mr. Trump had secured an early victory, that social media was censoring his win and that Mr. Biden was cheating.

Twitter accounts with large followings pushed a debunked conspiracy theory, adopted by some prominent American conservatives, that election workers in Maricopa County, Ariz., had given Trump voters pens that could not be detected by ballot scanners. Others claimed that armed protesters funded by the billionaire Mr. Soros were taking over the U.S. Capitol.

By Wednesday, disinformation experts like Mr. Quran likened the flood of Spanish-language disinformation to an emergency and called on social media platforms to retroactively inform anyone who engaged with the content that the claims were false.

The reach of the disinformation is vast. In just 24 hours, Spanish-language disinformation was generating traffic that eclipsed even the interference campaign by the Kremlin-backed Russian Internet Research Agency four years ago.

On Facebook, a video posted to a seven-month-old Colombian account called Mr. Capacho en Vivo, with 40,000 followers, accused Twitter of censoring Mr. Trump’s victory and had already been viewed more than 500,000 times — far more traffic than Russian trolls generated with fake Black Lives Matter ads ahead of the 2016 election.

Marketed as a global finance and political news page, the Colombian account pushed QAnon conspiracies, such as the baseless belief that leading Democrats are part of a global cabal of Satanist child molesters. On Monday, the same account posted an edited, misleading video of Mr. Biden touching children, falsely claiming that he was a “superpredator.” By Wednesday, the video had been watched about 45,000 times.

Another Spanish-language influencer, Ciro Gómez Leyva, who has more than two million YouTube subscribers, posted a video late Tuesday in which he claimed that 150 members of antifa were descending on Washington with “gas masks, arms and shields.” While protesters did march outside the White House, there was no evidence that weapons were involved.

On the Spanish-language YouTube channel Campechaneando, a host warned viewers not to believe news that Mr. Biden had overtaken Mr. Trump in the Electoral College count. Some 160,000 people had watched the video by Wednesday.

On another Spanish-language channel, Informativo G24, with more than 500,000 subscribers, hosts compared Democrats to Nazis on Tuesday. The video was seen some 350,000 times.

In Miami, a Spanish-language radio show, “Cada Tarde con Carinés Moncada y Agustín Acosta,” pushed debunked claims late Tuesday that Republican poll watchers had been barred from observing voting locations in Pennsylvania.

In September, one of the show’s co-hosts, Carinés A. Moncada, had pushed a conspiracy theory that a co-founder of Black Lives Matter was involved in devil worship.

It is difficult, if not impossible, to know how much false claims influenced Latino voters ahead of Election Day. But the hub of much of that misinformation was South Florida, home to a diverse community of Latinos, many of whom fled left-wing authoritarian regimes and are receptive to messaging about socialism.

When the results from Miami-Dade County came in on Tuesday, Mr. Trump outperformed expectations. Robust support from Hispanic voters helped him win Florida easily and allowed Republicans to flip two congressional seats in the state.

Juan Pablo Salas, a Colombian political analyst in Sarasota, Fla., said he worried that the misinformation involving Bogotá, Miami and Washington could be a coordinated effort between right-wing interests in Colombia and the U.S., “to essentially turn our Colombian-American community into the tip of the spear of the offense played by the extreme right.”

“They’ve invested a lot of money in turning South Florida into a campaign bastion,” Mr. Salas said of the Republican Party and the party of former President Álvaro Uribe of Colombia, who is close with many Miami Republicans.

On Tuesday night, Eduardo A. Gamarra, a professor of political science at Florida International University, agreed to analyze the election on NTN24, a television news network based in Colombia. He found himself on the air debating Omar Bula Escobar, a former United Nations representative notorious for, among other false claims, saying that Mr. Soros controls the Democratic Party, an anti-Semitic trope embraced by QAnon.

Dr. Gamarra said he rejected Mr. Bula Escobar’s baseless claims of election fraud and then telephoned the network after the interview had concluded.

“I said: ‘Don’t you ever do that to me again. Do background research on your guests,’” he said. “This is irresponsible.”

A producer for the show did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.

Evelyn Pérez-Verdía, a Democratic Latino issues strategist in South Florida, said she spent four hours on Tuesday trying to debunk false claims on Spanish-language radio that Mr. Biden, a moderate, was a left-wing radical.

“The Republicans called him a socialist, in those four hours, 20 times,” she said. “And a radical five times, and a Castro-Chavista” — a reference to Fidel Castro of Cuba and Hugo Chávez of Venezuela — “three times. Repeat a lie and repeat it until it becomes the truth.”

"With 200,000-Plus Outstanding Ballots, Georgia Remains in Nail-Biting Play","[Read more on Joe Biden’s president-elect acceptance speech.]

ATLANTA — In a nail-biting scenario whose resolution could help determine the winner of a tumultuous, fraught presidential race, state election officials in Georgia continued on Wednesday to count more than 200,000 outstanding ballots.

As of Wednesday night, about 40,000 votes separated the presidential candidates in Georgia, with President Trump leading his Democratic rival, Joseph R. Biden Jr., by less than one percentage point.

Beyond the fate of the state’s 16 electoral votes, the uncounted ballots also kept some down-ticket races unresolved, leaving open the possibility that Democrats’ big dreams of transforming Georgia may founder this week in the face of the enduring popularity of the Republican Party in the South.

At the same time, the closely contested presidential race underscored the fact that this Deep South state, once a reliable Republican stronghold, has become a legitimate battleground.

The fact that so many ballots remained uncounted came as little surprise. Voters were allowed to deposit absentee ballots in county drop boxes until 7 p.m. Tuesday. The process of counting them is labor-intensive, involving manually removing ballots from envelopes and, in some cases, subjecting them to human review.

But there were also unwelcome surprises, most notably a pipe that burst Tuesday morning in State Farm Arena, where the Atlanta Hawks play basketball and where Fulton County was tabulating votes. The plumbing failure, announced by county officials late Tuesday night, delayed the counting of an estimated 50,000 ballots.

The chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, David Shafer, said on Wednesday night that his group planned to file lawsuits in as many as a dozen Georgia counties over potential irregularities in the way local elections boards were handling absentee ballots still being counted.

The state party, along with the Trump campaign, filed one such legal action Wednesday in superior court in Chatham County, claiming that at least 53 ballots were potentially mishandled by the local elections board.

The petition raises the possibility that some absentee ballots had been improperly handled and received by the Chatham County Board of Elections after Tuesday’s 7 p.m. deadline for receiving votes. Chatham County, in coastal southeast Georgia, is home to the city of Savannah.

The petition asks the court to issue an order that would force the local election board to “collect, secure and safely store” all absentee ballots it received after the deadline, and “provide an accounting” of the ballots, including the names of absentee voters and the times the ballots were received.

In a news conference Wednesday morning, Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, said that the largest number of outstanding ballots, more than 70,000, was from Fulton County, which includes most of Atlanta and is a reliable Democratic stronghold. About 50,000 ballots were from DeKalb County, a Democratic-leaning area that also includes part of Atlanta.

Roughly 7,000 ballots were from Forsyth County, which voted heavily for Mr. Trump in 2016.

Mr. Raffensperger, a Republican and supporter of Mr. Trump, said he would pressure county officials in the state to complete its tally on Wednesday. But if a full vote count could not be finished, he added, he hoped that the number of uncounted ballots would be significantly reduced by the end of the day.

“If we don’t get there, but we get the number so small that then there’s no question of who actually the winner is, I think that will be really helpful, really remove a lot of those questions that people might have,” Mr. Raffensperger said.

On Wednesday evening, six states remained unresolved, with Mr. Biden leading Mr. Trump, 253 to 214, in electoral votes.

Leading up to Election Day, there was not much Georgia’s Democrats and Republicans agreed upon, except for a prediction that the day would be a dramatic one, given the rising strength of Georgia Democrats and the state’s recent notoriety for electoral system meltdowns and brutally long lines.

They were correct — but not always in the ways some imagined. Fears of embarrassing and widespread polling place glitches, like the kind that marred the June primaries in Fulton County, the most populous county in the state, did not materialize; most Georgia voters virtually waltzed through the voting process on Tuesday.

The uncounted votes Wednesday also clouded the fate of a marquee U.S. Senate race between the incumbent, David Perdue, a Republican, and his Democratic challenger, Jon Ossoff. As of early Wednesday, Mr. Perdue led by about 155,000 votes. But with a Libertarian candidate pulling more than 2 percent of the vote, the possibility of a January runoff between the two leading candidates remained possible.

The state’s second high-profile Senate race is certainly headed to a runoff, with Senator Kelly Loeffler, a Republican, and the Rev. Dr. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, emerging as the two top performers in a crowded race Tuesday night.

Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University, said these short-term uncertainties could not obscure the new, emerging reality that Georgia was now a state where tough and bruising electoral battles were likely to be the new norm.

“I think regardless of who wins the presidential election and who ultimately wins the Senate races, it’s clear that Georgia is electorally competitive,” Dr. Gillespie said. “We are entering an era of Georgia politics where we’re probably going to see more races that are going to be decided by small margins — and an era where we are going to see Democrats and Republicans alternate.”

Republicans showed their continued strength not only in the presidential and Senate races, but also in the fight for control over the State Legislature, where they will continue to control both chambers, complementing Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican.

Democrats fared better in two key congressional races in the northern suburbs of Atlanta. This vote-rich area was once easily dominated by Republicans. But growing diversity and a distaste for Trumpism, particularly among college-educated suburban women, has given Democrats a firm foothold there.

In the Sixth Congressional District, Representative Lucy McBath, a Democrat and outspoken gun-control advocate, defeated Karen Handel, her Republican challenger who briefly held the seat after winning a 2017 special election.

In the Seventh Congressional District, Carolyn Bourdeaux, a Democrat, was leading Rich McCormick, a Republican, by about two percentage points with an estimated 95 percent of the votes reported.

The seat is being vacated by Representative Rob Woodall, a Republican who has held the seat since 2011, but defeated Ms. Bourdeaux two years ago by fewer than 500 votes — a sign of growing Democratic strength in the suburbs."
The Polls Underestimated Trump — Again. Nobody Agrees on Why.,"[Read more on Joe Biden’s president-elect acceptance speech.]

As the results rolled in on Tuesday night, so did a strong sense of déjà vu. Pre-election polls, it appeared, had been misleading once again.

While the nation awaits final results from Pennsylvania, Arizona and other key states, it is already clear — no matter who ends up winning — that the industry failed to fully account for the missteps that led it to underestimate Donald J. Trump’s support four years ago. And it raises the question of whether the polling industry, which has become a national fixation in an era of data journalism and statistical forecasting, can survive yet another crisis of confidence.

“I want to see all the results in, I want to see where those deviations are from pre-election polls and final margins,” Christopher Borick, the director of polling at Muhlenberg College in Pennsylvania, said in an interview. “But there’s ample evidence that there were major issues again. Just how deep they are, we’ll see.”

In some states where polls had projected President Trump losing narrowly — like Ohio, Iowa and Florida — he had already been declared the winner by a comfortable margin by late Tuesday evening. And in states that had seemed more than likely to go for Joseph R. Biden Jr., like Michigan and Nevada, the result was too close to call last night.

To some degree, it was clear this process would be unwieldy. With large numbers of mail-in ballots and early in-person votes still uncounted, the earliest returns in most states gave an inflated sense of Mr. Trump’s strength, since voters in Republican areas turned out in higher numbers on Election Day — and those ballots were often the first to be tabulated.

It is also possible, said Patrick Murray, the polling director at Monmouth University, that Republicans’ efforts to prevent certain populations from voting easily had a sizable impact — a factor that pollsters knew would be immeasurable in their surveys.

“We need to know how many votes were rejected,” he said. “I won’t know, until somebody actually gives me some data, what happened. And it’s possible that we will never know.”

He added, “We will never know how many ballots were not delivered by the post office.”

But what is now clear based on the ballots that have been counted (and in almost all states, a majority have been) is that there was an overestimation of Mr. Biden’s support across the board — particularly with white voters and with men, preliminary exit polls indicate.

While polling had presaged a swing away from Mr. Trump among white voters 65 and over, that never fully took shape.

Partly as a result, Mr. Biden underperformed not only in polyglot states like Florida but also in heavily white, suburban areas like Macomb County, Mich., where he had been widely expected to do well.

Dr. Borick pointed out that while state-level polls had widely misfired in 2016, they held steady in the 2018 midterms. This led him to conclude that people’s views on Mr. Trump may be particularly difficult to measure.

“In the end, like so many Trump-related things, there may be different rules when polling an election with him on the ballot,” Dr. Borick said. “I’m a quantifiable type of human being; I want to see evidence. And I only have two elections with Donald Trump in them — but both seem to be behaving in ways that others don’t behave.”

Analyzing pre-election polls alongside exit polls is like comparing apples to apples — if one batch is rotten, the other probably is, too. But the exit polls can still provide a few clues as to what pre-election polls might have missed.

At the top of that list is Mr. Trump’s strength among college-educated white voters, particularly men. According to the exit polls, the candidates split white college graduates evenly — after an election season in which almost every major poll of the country and of battleground states had shown Mr. Biden ahead with white degreeholders.

And if there is a tendency for polls to underrepresent Mr. Trump’s support, it does not only affect college-educated voters, as “shy Trump” theorists have often suggested. Some studies had posited that highly educated Trump supporters might be more likely to say they preferred his opponent because of social pressure. In many high-quality phone polls before the election, Mr. Trump’s support ran in the mid-to-high 50s among white voters without degrees. But the results of the exit polls put his support with this group firmly in the mid-60s, about on par with his totals in 2016.

There is also no certainty about how much of the electorate these voters comprised. Pollsters puzzled over this question in the wake of 2016, and came to varying conclusions; this year’s results are likely to reignite that discussion.

On the subject of the coronavirus pandemic, it is also notable that compared with most pre-election surveys, the exit polls showed a smaller share of respondents favoring caution over a quick reopening. As of Wednesday afternoon, with final adjustments still anticipated to the data, there was only a nine-percentage-point split between the voters saying it was more important to contain the virus and those saying they cared more about hastening to rebuild the economy, according to the exit polls. In pre-election surveys, the split had typically been well into the double digits, with a considerable majority of voters nationwide saying they preferred caution and containment.

It appears that the virus was also less of a motivating factor for voters than many polls had appeared to convey. This year, the exit polls — conducted as usual by Edison Research on behalf of a consortium of news organizations — had direct competition from a new, probability-based voter survey: VoteCast, collected via an online panel assembled for The Associated Press by NORC, an independent research group at the University of Chicago. By looking at the divergence between the exit polls’ numbers and the responses to the VoteCast canvass, we can see that there were far more voters who considered the coronavirus a big-deal issue in their lives than people who said it was the issue they were voting on.

The VoteCast survey found that upward of four in 10 voters said the pandemic was the No. 1 issue facing the country when presented with a list of nine choices. But in the exit polls, when asked which issue had the biggest impact on their voting decision, respondents were less than half as likely to indicate it was the pandemic. Far more likely was the economy; behind that was the issue of racial inequality.

Not every pollster fared poorly. Ann Selzer, long considered one of the top pollsters in the country, released a poll with The Des Moines Register days before the election showing Mr. Trump opening up a seven-point lead in Iowa; that appears to be in line with the actual result thus far.

In an interview, Ms. Selzer said that this election season she had stuck to her usual process, which involves avoiding assumptions that one year’s electorate will resemble those of previous years. “Our method is designed for our data to reveal to us what is happening with the electorate,” she said. “There are some that will weight their data taking into account many things — past election voting, what the turnout was, things from the past in order to project into the future. I call that polling backwards, and I don’t do it.”

Inevitably, Robert Cahaly and his mysterious Trafalgar Group — which projected a number of close races in the battlegrounds — will also get another look from curious commentators wondering why his polls have been so close to accurate, both in 2016 and this year.

The firm was among the only pollsters to show Mr. Trump’s strength in the Midwest and Pennsylvania four years ago, and while its polls this fall may end up being a little on the rosy-red side, they appear to have gotten closer to the final horse-race results in states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada than did other pollsters, by not giving short shrift to Mr. Trump’s strengths."
Democrats’ ‘Blue Wave’ Crashed in Statehouses Across the Country,"[Cheers erupt on New York City streets after President-elect Joe Biden’s victory is declared.]

After an election that failed to deliver the powerful gains that Democrats had hoped for, results from statehouses painted a similar picture, with the lowest number of chambers changing hands in more than half a century.

Democrats had hoped for a “Blue Wave” to sweep statehouses that Republicans had controlled for years, running expensive ad campaigns and extensive get-out-the-vote efforts. But as the results came in, it became increasingly clear that they had failed on multiple fronts.

On Wednesday, the results were not yet final, but the National Conference of State Legislatures, which tracks state-level races, said there were changes or potential shifts of control in just four chambers: the New Hampshire House and Senate, which Republicans took back from Democrats, and possibly the House and Senate in Arizona, though the contests for those chambers were still too close to call. He said it was the first time since 1946 that so few chambers were changing hands.

“This is crazy in that almost nothing has changed,” said Tim Storey, an expert with the N.C.S.L. “It really jumps off the page.”

Democrats failed to take control of the Texas House from Republicans, a prize that had seemed within reach. They also lost the battle for North Carolina’s House and Senate, chambers they had set their sights on after years of Republican control. And they failed to flip the Iowa House, according to the N.C.S.L. Democrats also failed to flip the Houses in Pennsylvania and Michigan, Mr. Storey said.

“Our electoral targets in this election were in difficult states that remain gerrymandered from a decade ago,” said Patrick Rodenbush, communications director for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. “It was always going to take a ‘blue wave’ for us to get deeper into the map in states like Texas and North Carolina, and that didn’t happen for Democrats.”

He said Democrats had achieved some victories, like preventing Republicans from gaining a supermajority in the Wisconsin Assembly, which will stop the Legislature from overriding any veto of electoral maps by the Democratic governor. And the election of Judge Jennifer Brunner to the Ohio Supreme Court reduces the court’s conservative majority from four to three, he said.

Statehouses are important because they are the places where issues like abortion, guns and police reform get decided. They are particularly critical this year because of a process known as redistricting: the redrawing of state and national electoral maps after the decennial census. While some states use nonpartisan or bipartisan commissions to draw these maps, the process in most states is controlled by the majority party in the state legislature. The most recent census is being finalized, and data will be sent to the states for redistricting beginning next year.

Republicans still have a distinct advantage since winning two dozen chambers in the 2010 election cycle, double the average number of chambers that flip every two years, according to Mr. Storey. Before Tuesday’s election, Republicans controlled about three-fifths of all 98 partisan legislative chambers. If no other chambers flip as new results come in, that Republican dominance will not change.

“It was a huge night for state Republicans,” said David Abrams, deputy executive director of the Republican State Leadership Committee, which focuses on electing Republicans to state offices. “Democrats spent hundreds of millions of dollars to flip state chambers. So far, they don’t have a damn thing to show for it.”

In all, about 80 percent of the nation’s 7,383 state legislative seats were up for grabs.

The Democrats did not make much progress in governor’s races either. In Montana, the Republican, Greg Gianforte, won against Mike Cooney, a Democrat, who was the lieutenant governor. The state’s governor, Steve Bullock, a Democrat, ran for U.S. Senate and lost to the Republican incumbent, Steve Daines. The outcome in Montana ends more than 16 years of Democratic leadership in a state that usually votes for Republicans for president.

In Missouri, Gov. Mike Parson, the Republican incumbent, won re-election, beating his Democratic challenger, Nicole Galloway, by 17 percentage points. North Carolina’s Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, held on to his seat in a close race against his Republican challenger, Dan Forest.

Measures to change rules over redistricting passed in several states. In Missouri, voters approved a plan that would effectively restore control over redistricting to the Republican-controlled legislature, from a process that involved a more neutral state demographer. In Virginia, where Democrats took control of both chambers last year, voters approved a measure moving the process from the state legislature to a redistricting commission composed of state legislators and citizens, according to The Associated Press.

A Vote That Flew in the Face of Fear Itself,"[Read more on Joe Biden’s president-elect acceptance speech.]

Struggling through one of the most devastating years in the history of the United States, a year of strife and suffering and loss, the nation’s people responded with resolve on the first Tuesday of November. Together but apart, they voted.

Undaunted by a pandemic that worsens by the day, they showed up in the early-morning snow outside the clapboard town offices of Newbury, N.H. Formed a shivering line into a gymnasium in Tobyhanna, Pa. Waited their turn in an elementary school in Louisville, Ky.; a public-housing complex in Houston; a recreation center in Garden Grove, Calif.; a bowling alley in Mandan, N.D.

They provided final punctuation to the 100 million votes already cast through mail-in ballots and in-person early voting, the crest to a tidal wave of turnout. Many showed up at the polls wearing masks, the coronavirus accessory that has come to symbolize this annus horribilis.

By their numbers, they underscored the consequences of the 2020 election, one that would choose between starkly different paths for the future of a politically and racially divided Republic: between the visions of Donald J. Trump, the Republican incumbent, and Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic challenger.

“I’ve been voting for over 30 years, and this is the first time I’ve had a knot in my stomach on Election Day,” Lisa Payton, 55, said as she waited to vote in midmorning outside a municipal building in Stroudsburg, in Pennsylvania’s Pocono Mountains.

She said she took off from her job as a legal assistant to vote for Mr. Biden, but would spend the rest of the day watching Netflix movies and hanging Christmas decorations, rather than watch the news as the country’s fate hung in the balance. Too nervous, she said.

She was not alone. Fear and anxiety abounded, as plywood was hammered into place over storefronts in cities across the country — Boston, New York, Chicago, Washington, Los Angeles — all in anticipation of election-related mayhem that, for the most part, never materialized.

The election was a referendum on 2020, a year that began a decade ago, it seems, with the impeachment — though not conviction — of President Trump. A year that many would prefer simply to end, no matter that nearly two months remain.

Though not spelled out in ink, memories and realities shared the ballot with the two major presidential candidates. The wildfires altering the Western landscape and the hurricanes pummeling the Gulf Coast; the audacious rise of white supremacists and self-appointed militias; the ongoing fight over abortion and the lightning-quick confirmation of a Supreme Court justice; the angry but peaceful marches for racial justice; the protests that devolved into violence.

Looming over it all has been the pandemic, entirely nonpartisan in the toll it takes.

The coronavirus — and the government’s failure to contain it — has led to more than 230,000 American deaths, and the head of Mr. Trump’s own response effort warned this week of an even more deadly phase approaching. The pandemic has upended the economy, forced countless businesses to close, sent millions into unemployment and poverty.

Beyond those who, fearing infection, chose to vote by mail, many who cast a ballot on Election Day experienced firsthand the completeness with which the virus has altered everyday American life. Face masks were, if not mandatory, at least expected, and poll workers sometimes attended to the underpinnings of a democratic government behind transparent protective shields.

But the pandemic did not suppress the vote. If anything, the virus — and how it has been handled — helped to energize a day in which a simple ballot granted momentary power to those who have felt powerless against the onslaught of 2020, a year that has exposed national rifts in the starkest relief.

The fault line between visions for America could be found within 20 miles along the Shenango River in western Pennsylvania. At a polling center in a volunteer firehouse in Greenville, part of once-blue, now-red Mercer County, the vibe was decidedly Republican. “Trump Country,” asserted a campaign volunteer as he handed out sample ballots from a lawn chair.

Gareth Stell, 24, an oil worker in overalls, stopped to talk after voting in his first presidential election. He said he wanted elected officials who understood where he comes from, a place that does not embrace ambitious controls on guns and the environment.

“I live in small-town America,” said Mr. Stell, who is white. “We hunt, we fish, we own guns. That’s just what it comes down to.”

Less than 20 miles down the Shenango, the steel-mill town of Farrell offers a panorama of rusted smokestacks and weather-aged union halls — what, in the accepted stereotype, would also now be called Trump Country.

It is not. Farrell swings Democratic, and nearly half its 5,000 residents are Black. And while Mr. Stell up in Greenville preferred the status quo, Carminal Craig of Farrell demanded change.

Mr. Craig, 54, had just voted for Mr. Biden at the Prince of Peace Center, a social service agency transformed into a polling center. He said he came from a mill family, but the mill life was gone — “The old school is done” — and things needed to be rethought.

“Change needs to come at the White House, the state, the local government,” Mr. Craig said. “Everyone needs to change.”

Change was the operative word elsewhere.

In Minneapolis, Cynthia Robertson snapped photographs of the flowers and murals at the sun-dappled memorial established in honor of George Floyd, the unarmed Black man who died in May after a white police officer knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes. His death, recorded in excruciating videos, became a touchstone event in 2020, sparking nationwide protest marches and deeper examinations of the country’s history of racism.

Ms. Robertson, 46, who is Black and the mother of teenagers, pointed to murals depicting other Black people killed at the hands of police, including one of Breonna Taylor, 26, killed in a botched police raid in Louisville, Ky., in March. As she stood at the corner of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, where Mr. Floyd died, tears welled behind her bedazzle-framed sunglasses.

“This could be my son; this could be my daughter,” she said. And this was why she had decided to vote for the first time in her life — for Mr. Biden. “Look around us,” Ms. Robertson said. “This is the reason.”

The police shooting of another Black man, Jacob Blake, in Kenosha, Wis., in late August sparked violent demonstrations, including one in which two people were shot dead on a downtown street. The police have charged Kyle Rittenhouse, a white teenager who came from Illinois to patrol the streets with a military-style semiautomatic rifle; he has since become the conservative personification of self-defense and the right to bear arms.

On Election Day, nearly three months later, the case of Mr. Rittenhouse — along with the fires, looting and protests — continued to be felt in Kenosha, a city of 100,000. Charred vehicles still sit in parking lots; businesses, while open, are still boarded up with plywood.

Miranda Schlitz, 45, who works as a server at a drive-in restaurant called Big Star, recalled that when Kenosha’s downtown was in the throes of unrest and destruction, she was so concerned for her family’s safety that she went to stay with her sister in a neighboring city.

“I was literally afraid in my home,” said Ms. Schlitz, who is white. She echoed one of Mr. Trump’s often-tweeted campaign themes. “We need law and order.”

“The riots — that’s when my decision was final,” Ms. Schlitz said. Her decision: a vote cast for Donald Trump.

If unrest had transformed downtown Kenosha, then the coronavirus had transformed the country — a reality on display as people exercised their sacred right to vote. Voters approaching the Kenosha Bible Church first passed a hand-washing station and then a kiosk offering free masks, wipes and sanitizer — all before entering a gym where tables were spaced at least 15 feet apart. Meanwhile, in Oakland, Calif., an outdoor voting system included masked workers using salad tongs to take ballots.

At a time when the deadly coronavirus has been framed by some as overblown — a time when the president has suggested that doctors benefit financially from the pandemic — the outcome of the election took precedent. In Milwaukee, at the Aurora Sinai Medical Center, one of many hospitals being tested by a spiking number of Covid-19 patients, a nurse named Karina Brown said that hospital workers and patients alike were checking their cellphones and “fancy watches” for updates throughout the day.

She was doing the same. “We want the coronavirus to slow down and stop — and I think that’s why this election is so important to us,” Ms. Brown said. “Anxious is an understatement.”

The anxiety extended beyond concerns about health to concerns about employment; about feeding families and paying bills.

In Las Vegas, where the pandemic has cleaned out the casinos, more than half of the 600,000 members of the powerful, immigrant-heavy Culinary Workers Union are out of work — and, on Tuesday, were motivated to vote.

At first light, an army of union workers — those who cook the meals and clean the rooms — set out to drum up Election Day votes, prepared to make the pitch in Mandarin, Spanish or Tagalog. Among the foot soldiers was Tedros Naga, 51, an Ethiopian immigrant who works as a cook.

He and his wife both lost their jobs as the virus leveled the tourism and entertainment industries. With little work to find in Las Vegas, he spent October knocking on doors, encouraging fellow union members to vote early. It has not been a hard sell.

“People have no work,” Mr. Naga said. “People have no food. They maybe soon are losing their house. They want change.”

The virus has struck as well at the core of the American psyche — at the crossroads of individual rights and collective resolve. The federal recommendation to wear a mask, for example, makes obvious sense to some but smacks of deep-state oppression to others.

At a polling station in the New Church of Faith, just outside Orlando, Fla., a woman named Veronica, 35, said she had voted for Mr. Trump because she feared for her freedoms. Moments later, a woman named Dorothy, 45, emerged to say she had voted for Mr. Biden because she feared for her freedoms.

On an Election Day in a pandemic, at a time when the national divide seemed more like a chasm than a fracture, two voters exiting a church were united at least in the operative emotion of 2020: fear.

"With His Path to Re-election Narrowing, Trump Turns to the Courts","With his political path narrowing, President Trump turned to the courts and procedural maneuvers on Wednesday in a last-ditch effort to stave off defeat in the handful of states that will decide the outcome of the bitterly fought election.

The president’s campaign intervened at the Supreme Court in a case challenging Pennsylvania’s plan to count ballots received for up to three days after Election Day. The campaign said it would also file suit in Michigan to halt the counting there while it pursues its demands for better access for the observers it sent to monitor elections boards for signs of malfeasance in tallying ballots, modeled on a similar suit it was pursuing in Nevada.

On Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump’s team added Georgia to its list of legal targets, seeking a court order enforcing strict deadlines in Chatham County in the wake of allegations by a Republican poll observer that a small number of ineligible ballots might be counted in one location.

In Wisconsin, which along with Michigan was called on Wednesday for his Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., the president’s campaign announced it would request a recount.

The moves signaled Mr. Trump’s determination to make good on his longstanding threats to carry out an aggressive post-Election Day campaign to upend any result not in his favor and pursue his baseless allegations that the outcome was rigged.

But it was not clear how much effect any of his efforts would have. In Georgia, the suit is about 53 ballots, and another case in Pennsylvania is about fewer than 100.

The suits appeared intended at least in part to give some legal weight to a fight that Mr. Trump has largely carried out on Twitter and amplified during an overnight appearance at the White House, where he falsely claimed to have won and asserted with no evidence that his opponents were trying to steal the election. 

As the legal team began staking its ground, campaign surrogates, aides and the president himself sought to create a public relations drumbeat to promote that theme. Mr. Trump had long indicated he would push that argument in the widely expected event that early leads for him in Election Day counts withered as a record number of mail ballots — used disproportionately by Democrats this year — tipped the balance toward Mr. Biden.

With Mr. Biden in a strong position and the counting trending in his favor, the chances of the outcome being determined in court ebbed on Wednesday. But the day nonetheless had some echoes of the 2000 recount in Florida in which Al Gore unsuccessfully challenged an outcome that gave George W. Bush the presidency.

In a scene that was reminiscent of the so-called Brooks Brothers Riot protest on behalf of Mr. Bush that temporarily halted counting in Miami-Dade that year, a crush of Trump supporters on Wednesday stormed a counting office in Detroit with shouts of “Stop the count.”

But this year’s legal clashes were breaking out across several states, and in most cases, it was the Republicans who appeared to be battling from behind, a disadvantageous opening position, though one that Mr. Trump’s aides hoped would shift yet again as the counts continued to evolve.

Throughout the day, Republicans claimed that they sought to ensure only that the recorded tally did not include votes that should not have counted, rather than repeating the president’s claims that all counting should have stopped on Election Day when early and incomplete results showed him ahead.

“If we count all legal ballots, the president wins,” the Trump campaign manager, Bill Stepien, said on a morning conference call with reporters.

Mr. Stepien took a more aggressive posture later in the day, attempting with no basis to declare victory for Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania even as the vote-counting continued.

The Trump campaign dispatched Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, and Eric Trump, one of his sons, to Philadelphia to ensure, as Mr. Stepien sought to portray it without any evidence, that “magical pallets” of mail ballots for Mr. Biden did not suddenly appear and that “this margin of victory that we are certain of is not stolen by the Democrats and stolen by Joe Biden.”

Early on Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump had appeared before supporters and reporters at the White House to say, “We’ll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court, we want all voting to stop,” a statement that drew bipartisan criticism.

His campaign team did go to the Supreme Court on Wednesday to file a motion to take over perhaps the highest-profile of the elections cases. In that dispute, Pennsylvania Republicans had sought to block state officials from moving forward with their plan to count all mail ballots postmarked on or before Nov. 3 for three days after Election Day. The state’s legal deadline for the receipt of ballots is ordinarily 8 p.m. on Election Day.

Republicans unsuccessfully sought to appeal their case against the deadline extension to the Supreme Court twice, but on the second occasion three justices — Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas — indicated they would be open to reconsidering their arguments during the post-Election Day period, when their newest colleague, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, would be settled into her role on the court.

The court could, conceivably, decide to take up the case, though that would be a rare move. And Republicans would need to gather more evidence to show that they were harmed by the deadline extension before filing a new motion to engage the court.

Democrats portrayed the Republican efforts as part of a desperate bid to reverse a trajectory that was threatening their hold on the White House.

“We’re winning the election,” Bob Bauer, a senior Biden campaign adviser, said in a call with reporters on Wednesday, “and we’re going to protect the election.”

He said that for the Biden campaign and the Democratic Party, that meant meeting court challenges from Mr. Trump and the Republicans wherever they might arise. The national party did so late Wednesday in another case the president’s campaign was bringing in Pennsylvania seeking to reject votes from citizens who were given opportunities to fix problems that had caused their mail-in ballots to be rejected.

A federal judge appeared to meet the Republican claims in a related lawsuit — affecting roughly 93 provisional ballots in Montgomery County outside of Philadelphia — with skepticism.

“Wasn’t the legislative intent of the statute that we’re talking about was to enfranchise, not disenfranchise voters?” Judge Timothy J. Savage, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, asked the Republican counsel, Thomas Breth. The judge later chided Mr. Breth for referring to “this disenfranchisement game.”

A state court rejected one lawsuit seeking more access to observe the counting of ballots.

The Trump campaign lawsuits in Pennsylvania drew a stern rebuke from Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, who called the legal machinations “simply wrong.”

“These attempts to subvert the democratic process are simply disgraceful,” Mr. Wolf said during a news conference Wednesday evening. “We are going to fight every single attempt to disenfranchise voters.”

In the entire legal effort the Trump campaign appeared at times to be trying to walk up a down escalator.

It found itself in an awkward position of seeking to halt counting in some states — where it wanted to limit Mr. Biden’s ability to build more comfortable margins — even as it sought recounts in others were it hoped to cut into Mr. Biden’s margins.

And in many cases, it was unclear its moves would gain enough votes to make up the gaps Mr. Biden appeared to be building, which extended into the thousands as opposed to the hundreds that separated Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore in Florida 20 years ago.

“If the margin is more than 1,000 votes, it’s really uphill,” said Benjamin L. Ginsberg, a longtime Republican election lawyer. “If it’s within 10,000 votes, that’s an almost an unscalable mountain.”

The Trump campaign identified Nevada, where Mr. Biden’s margin appeared relatively slim as of late Wednesday, as another vote-counting battleground. The state allows any losing candidate to request a recount.

While there is no automatic trigger in Wisconsin for a recount, any losing candidate can force one if the race stays within one percentage point. With roughly 3.2 million ballots cast in the state, that means any margin within about 32,000 could force a recount. On Wednesday, Mr. Biden had been declared the winner in Wisconsin with a roughly 21,000-vote margin.

But one prominent Republican in the state, former Gov. Scott Walker, seemed to be skeptical that the recount would bring about a different outcome for Mr. Trump.

“After recount in 2011 race for WI Supreme Court, there was a swing of 300 votes,” Mr. Walker wrote on Twitter. A 2016 recount triggered by a request from Jill Stein of the Green Party found only 131 votes. “As I said, 20,000 is a high hurdle,” he wrote."
"Win or Lose, Trump Will Remain a Powerful and Disruptive Force","WASHINGTON — If President Trump loses his bid for re-election, as looked increasingly likely on Wednesday, it would be the first defeat of an incumbent president in 28 years. But one thing seemed certain: Win or lose, he will not go quietly away.

Trailing former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Trump spent the day trying to discredit the election based on invented fraud claims, hoping either to hang onto power or explain away a loss. He could find a narrow path to re-election among states still counting, but he has made clear that he would not shrink from the scene should he lose.

At the very least, he has 76 days left in office to use his power as he sees fit and to seek revenge on some of his perceived adversaries. Angry at a defeat, he may fire or sideline a variety of senior officials who failed to carry out his wishes as he saw it, including Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top infectious diseases specialist, in the middle of a pandemic.

And if he is forced to vacate the White House on Jan. 20, Mr. Trump is likely to prove more resilient than expected and almost surely will remain a powerful and disruptive force in American life. He received at least 68 million votes, or five million more than he did in 2016, and commanded about 48 percent of the popular vote, meaning he retained the support of nearly half of the public despite four years of scandal, setbacks, impeachment and the brutal coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 233,000 Americans.

That gives him a power base to play a role that other defeated one-term presidents like Jimmy Carter and George Bush have not played. Mr. Trump has long toyed with starting his own television network to compete with Fox News, and in private lately he has broached the idea of running again in 2024, although he would be 78 by then. Even if his own days as a candidate are over, his 88-million-strong Twitter following gives him a bullhorn to be an influential voice on the right, potentially making him a kingmaker among rising Republicans.

“If anything is clear from the election results, it is that the president has a huge following, and he doesn’t intend to exit the stage anytime soon,” said former Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, one of the few Republican officeholders to break with Mr. Trump over the past four years.

That following may yet enable Mr. Trump to eke out a second term and four years to try to rebuild the economy and reshape the Republican Party in his image. But even from out of office, he could try to pressure Republican senators who preserved their majority to resist Mr. Biden at every turn, forcing them to choose between conciliation or crossing his political base.

Until a new generation of Republicans steps forward, Mr. Trump could position himself as the de facto leader of the party, wielding an extraordinary database of information about his supporters that future candidates would love to rent or otherwise access. Allies imagined other Republicans making a pilgrimage to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida seeking his blessing.

“It isn’t like his Twitter account or his ability to control a news cycle will stop,” said Brad Parscale, the president’s first campaign manager in this election cycle. “President Trump also has the largest amount of data ever collected by a politician. This will impact races and policies for years to come.”

Exit polls showed that regardless of prominent Republican defectors like Senator Mitt Romney of Utah and the Never Trumpers of the Lincoln Project, Mr. Trump enjoyed strong support within his own party, winning 93 percent of Republican voters. He also did somewhat better with Black voters (12 percent) and Hispanic voters (32 percent) than he did four years ago despite his often racist rhetoric. And after his high-energy blitz across battleground states, late-deciding voters broke his way.

Some of Mr. Trump’s arguments carried considerable weight with members of his party. Despite the coronavirus pandemic and the related economic toll, 41 percent of voters said they were doing better than when he took office, compared with only 20 percent who described themselves as worse off. Adopting his priorities, 35 percent of voters named the economy as the most important issue, twice as many who cited the pandemic. Fully 49 percent said the economy was good or excellent, and 48 percent approved of his government’s handling of the virus.

“If he is defeated, the president will retain the undying loyalty of the party’s voters and the new voters he brought into the party,” said Sam Nunberg, who was a strategist on Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign. “President Trump will remain a hero within the Republican electorate. The winner of the 2024 Republican presidential primary will either be President Trump or the candidate who most closely resembles him.”

Not all Republicans share that view. While Mr. Trump will no doubt continue to speak out and assert himself on the public stage, they said the party would be happy to try to move beyond him if he loses and he would be remembered as an aberration.

“There will never be another Trump,” said former Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida. “Copycats will fail. He will gradually fade, but the scars from this tumultuous period in American history will never disappear.”

Indeed, Mr. Trump failed to reproduce his fluky 2016 success when he secured an Electoral College victory even while losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton. For all of the tools of incumbency, he failed to pick up a single state that he did not win last time, and as of Wednesday, he had lost two or three, with a couple of others still on the edge.

Other presidents evicted after a single term or less — like Gerald R. Ford in 1976, Mr. Carter in 1980 and Mr. Bush in 1992 — tended to fade back into the political shadows. Mr. Ford briefly contemplated a comeback, Mr. Carter occasionally criticized his successors and Mr. Bush campaigned for his sons, but none of them remained major political forces within their party for long. Politically, at least, each of them was seen to various degrees as a spent force.

The last defeated president to try to play a power-broker role after leaving office was Herbert Hoover, who positioned himself to run again after his loss in 1932 to Franklin D. Roosevelt and became an outspoken leader of the conservative wing of the Republican Party. While he wielded significant influence for years, it did not regain him the nomination nor change the verdict of history.

For Mr. Trump, who cares about “winning, winning, winning” more than almost anything, being known as a loser would be intolerable. On Election Day, during a visit to his campaign headquarters, he mused aloud about that. “Winning is easy,” he told reporters and staff members. “Losing is never easy. Not for me it’s not.”

To avoid such a fate, the president sought on Wednesday to convince supporters that the election was being stolen simply because state and local authorities were counting legally cast ballots. The fact that it was not true evidently mattered little to him. He was setting up a narrative to justify legal challenges that even Republican lawyers called groundless and, should those fail, to set himself up as a martyr who was not repudiated by the voters but somehow robbed by unseen nefarious forces.

Mr. Trump himself has a long history on the other end of fraud allegations. His sister asserted that he got someone else to take his college-entrance exam. The daughters of a Queens foot doctor claimed that their late father gave Mr. Trump a diagnosis of bone spurs to protect him from the draft for the Vietnam War as a favor to Fred Trump, his father. And his business dealings have often ensnared him in allegations and lawsuits.

The younger Mr. Trump paid $25 million to students of his Trump University to settle fraud accusations. His charitable foundation was shut down after the authorities found a “shocking pattern of illegality.” He participated in dubious tax schemes during the 1990s, including instances of outright fraud, according to a New York Times investigation. And Michael D. Cohen, his estranged lawyer and fixer, wrote in a recent book that he rigged two online polls on Mr. Trump’s behalf.

The president has survived all of that and a string of bankruptcies and other failures through a life of celebrity and populist appeals that gave him the aura of a winner that he nurtured. From his time in real estate and reality television, he has been part of the country’s pop culture firmament for 30 years, a recurring figure in movies, television shows and his own books.

He has been, for millions, a symbol of gold-gilded aspiration and wealth. He was the star of a popular television series for 14 seasons, one that introduced him to the country long before he ran for office. And once he did, his boisterous rallies bonded his supporters to him in a way that underscored how much of a cultural phenomenon he is.

For months, as his chances of being re-elected dwindled, Mr. Trump told advisers — sometimes joking, sometimes not — that should he lose he would promptly announce that he was running again in 2024. Two advisers said they anticipate he will make good on that declaration if his legal challenges fail and is defeated, a move that if nothing else would allow him to raise money to finance the rallies that sustain him.

When he appeared likely to lose his original campaign in 2016, he and some of his family members talked about starting a media property, loosely conceived of as “Trump TV.” Some of those discussions have continued into this year, according to people familiar with them.

“There’s no question that he is one of the greatest polarizing political figures of modern history,” said Tony Fabrizio, one of Mr. Trump’s pollsters. “His supporters adore him and his opponents revile him. There is no middle ground on Donald Trump.”

"Could Omaha Swing the Race? In 2020, Nothing Is Impossible","[Joe Biden has won the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Read our story]

OMAHA — Tony Vargas stood on a street corner here on Election Day trying to rally passing drivers to re-elect him as state senator. A few blocks away was a meatpacking plant where workers walked off the job earlier this year after fears their bosses weren’t being transparent about a rising number of Covid cases inside. In the other direction was a polling place where Black and Latino voters lined up to cast ballots.

On Wednesday, Nebraska awakened to the news that its Omaha-based Second Congressional District delivered a single, potentially pivotal electoral vote for Joseph R. Biden Jr. in a state that otherwise solidly tilted toward President Trump.

Neighborhoods in the district like the one where Mr. Vargas stood and waved signs are part of the reason.

“This same community voted in the past for Republicans and for Democrats, but with Biden they saw somebody who cares more about everybody,” said Mr. Vargas, who won his race Tuesday. “People are choosing the person over the politics.”

Unlike 48 other states, Nebraska splits its electoral votes by congressional district. (Maine does also.) Both campaigns invested in reaching voters here, believing that it was not impossible that the final tally could come down to Omaha. It was a lightning-striking scenario, though.

On Wednesday, as tense ballot counting droned on, it was apparent how important that solo electoral vote was in a district in the middle of the country.

Mr. Biden notched victories in Michigan and Wisconsin. Arizona and Nevada were still counting ballots, though Democrats projected confidence in their chances. Pennsylvania was likely to take longer. By late in the afternoon, doing the math, that single Nebraska vote seemed as if it would put Mr. Biden up to 270.

Much to the delight of Omaha’s Democrats, and the chagrin of the rest of the state.

Nebraska as a whole is overwhelmingly Republican, but Omaha has tilted slowly left in past years and in significant ways since 2008, when Barack Obama captured the Second District’s vote.

“This has been building for a while,” said Paul Landow, a political science professor at the University of Nebraska-Omaha.

Omaha, with about one million people in its metropolitan area, is the epicenter of what conservatives see as a threat: progressive activism pushing even the area’s largely centrist Democrats further left.

The state’s Democrats have seized on the shift in sometimes gloating ways. Early this year, Gov. Pete Ricketts, a Republican, sent out a fund-raising pitch warning of the “creep of socialism” in Nebraska. The Nebraska Democratic Party responded by giving him a box of baby rattles.

And in announcing early Wednesday that Mr. Biden had won the district, Jane Kleeb, Nebraska Democratic Party chairwoman, rechristened her state’s biggest city as “Joe-maha.”

The notion of Nebraska as instrumental in a victory for a Democratic president might not be welcome in many areas of the state.

“It’s very red and takes Republican politics seriously, so I don’t think there would be a lot of joy in being the congressional district that put Biden over the top,” Mr. Landow said on Wednesday.

The Second District, which encompasses much of Omaha’s metropolitan area, in many ways is a miniature portrait of the nation.

The district incorporates a busy downtown that gives way to rolling waves of housing developments filled with boxy suburban homes, as well as farms outside the city limits.

Like much of the rest of Nebraska and the middle of country, the district is being hit hard by Covid-19, with cases climbing by the day. Similar to the situation in other swing states, winning over suburban female voters here was crucial to victory.

And as has occurred in many cities in America, protests broke out this summer over the death of George Floyd. In Omaha, protests turned violent when a white bar owner shot to death a Black man in June during one of the marches over racial injustice.

The city’s changing demographics, especially with its growing Latino population, mirror much of the rest of the country. Its increasingly younger minority population tilts Democratic, and its older white population leans Republican, much like the rest of the state.

Most politicians consider the district moderate, tilting left but not too left, a perception borne out by its congressional election results that show the Republican Don Bacon emerging as the winner against Kara Eastman, a progressive Democrat, whom he attacked as a “radical socialist” in television ads that dominated the airwaves in the run-up to the election.

At a rally in Omaha last week that drew thousands, as well as in a phone call last weekend, President Trump ordered Mr. Bacon to deliver the district for him. “I’ll tell you, you better get me on Omaha, you understand that?” Mr. Trump said at the rally. In the end, Mr. Bacon did not succeed.

Mr. Bacon has, in part, blamed Mr. Trump’s tone — his tweets in particular — for the president’s defeat in the district.

“People don’t like the name calling and the elbow throwing,” Mr. Bacon said in an interview Tuesday, adding that he saw himself as having worked with both parties to deliver for the district. Mr. Bacon also was endorsed by his predecessor and former rival, Brad Ashford, a Democrat.

Besides his recent rally, Mr. Trump sent campaign staff members and surrogates to Omaha. Mr. Biden’s campaign invested heavily in the district as well, ultimately sending a team of about 20 — and had surrogates who hammered home a message that he would be a president for all Nebraskans, not just Democrats.

“The way he handles himself and presents himself to voters appeals to a moderate district that for me is a snapshot of America,” said Ms. Kleeb, the state’s Democratic Party chairwoman.

Ms. Kleeb, who has written a book outlining how the Democratic Party can win back Republican rural America, described Omaha’s voters as “moderate economically but progressive on moderate issues” and populated by “suburban moms who are bleeding hearts with a strong ecosystem of supporting nonprofits, housing inequality and fighting against racial injustice.”

Denise Powell, co-founder of Women Who Run Nebraska, a political action committee that recruits progressive women as political candidates, said Mr. Trump’s stances on policies that affected women as well as his position on scaling back the Affordable Care Act, especially during a pandemic, motivated more women in Omaha to vote in this election than in 2016 when it seemed certain to many of them that Hillary Clinton would win.

“I was really excited about Kamala Harris, too,” Ms. Powell said. “For me that was a big motivating piece.”

In South Omaha, where Mr. Vargas’s district is, voters were receptive to a candidate who preached unity, not division, he said.

“We need someone who cares about compassion and cares about science during a pandemic,” he said. “People opened up their hearts and minds to that message and it stuck.”

South Omaha, a diverse neighborhood with a sizable Latino population, had among the highest case counts of Covid-19 in the city, Mr. Vargas said. The area once drew European immigrants to its slaughterhouses, but the work force in the meatpacking plants in the area now is largely Latino and includes immigrants from African countries and elsewhere.

Meatpacking workers generally have accounted for about one in five Covid-19 cases in the state, Mr. Vargas said. Governor Ricketts at one point this year announced that individual plants didn’t need to report their cases, a move that Mr. Vargas said upset the meatpacking employees in his district and showed a lack of transparency.

“Information is how we make decisions in our community,” said Mr. Vargas, whose father died of Covid-19 in New York in the spring.

Mr. Vargas, a Democrat, is currently the only Latino lawmaker in the state’s nonpartisan, unicameral legislature. To get anything accomplished, he said he needed to work with people from different backgrounds. On Tuesday, he overwhelmingly was re-elected to a second term in office after promoting a message that in part focused on bipartisanship.

He hopes a similar message that pushed the Biden-Harris ticket to victory in the Second District will radiate to the rest of the country.

“People are clamoring for government that focuses on building bridges,” he said. “That rung true this election.”"
"Exhausted and Anxious, Voters Find the Country More Divided Than Ever","HOLLYWOOD, Fla. — It was just after 2 a.m. Wednesday and President Trump was speaking from the White House, declaring both victory and voter fraud.

Dan Hensley, a lifelong Republican whose reservations about Mr. Trump had given way to strong support for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., was sitting alone in his Amelia Island, Fla., beach house, listening to the president say he had already won the election even though millions of votes remained uncounted.

Mr. Hensley, 63, rose from his favorite chair in the family room, turned off the television and went to bed, feeling like the country was more divided than ever.

“The great wedge in America just got bigger last night,” said Mr. Hensley, a corporate executive who had cast steady votes for Republicans since 1976 except in 2016, when he did not choose Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton. Three weeks ago, he joined his wife and two adult children in voting for Mr. Biden.

Wednesday morning dawned with uncertainty, dissatisfaction and fear. Hundreds of thousands of ballots were still being counted and major races — including for president — were still uncalled. But some truths were perfectly clear: Mr. Trump was not going to prove the experts wrong with a resounding win from the “silent majority.” And the Democrats were not going to deliver a decisive repudiation of Mr. Trump’s party with victories up and down the ballot.

That meant that as the two political camps geared up for litigation and spin battles in the coming days, many voters of both parties were left with the troubling realization that perhaps they had misunderstood their country, their towns, perhaps even their neighbors.

“Honestly, I woke up exhausted and anxious,” said Marbili Walters, 37, a Venezuela-born Trump supporter and local business director who spent the last two weeks knocking on doors in the St. Petersburg, Fla., area trying to convert voters. “It feels like there is one side or the other side and voting for someone else should not feel like we are at war.”

Across the Gulf of Mexico in Brownsville, Texas, Tony Villalobos, 44, was eating lunch with a workmate at a bustling taqueria on Wednesday afternoon. He had supported Mr. Biden, who he thought was a better reflection of South Texas values, and had expected he would win in a landslide. But not only did that not happen, Mr. Trump had found support from those Mr. Villalobos knows best — or thought he knew best.

“We were all on the same page and now we’re not,” he said. “In my friends and my family, now more and more people are going for Trump.”

Many Trump supporters and Biden supporters, pointing to poll numbers or boat rallies, had expected a definitive win for their preferred candidate, proof that clear majorities, even including people long assumed to be on the opposite side, quietly agreed with them about the country’s direction.

It turned out to be untrue. And now the question was this: What would come next? Among the most common predictions was violence in the streets, talked of as if it were almost a sure thing — some harking back to the tumult of the 1960s. Asked how this unrest might break out, most were quick with an answer: The other side would start it.

If Mr. Trump were in fact to pull off a victory in the end, “there’s still going to be riots,” said Nicholas Lubischer, 60, a utility salesman in the suburbs of Raleigh, N.C. “There’s still going to be civil unrest, nothing’s going to change as far as the divide in the country.”

This sounded pessimistic coming from a Trump supporter like Mr. Lubischer, who was convinced on Wednesday that Mr. Trump won and was surprised only that the race had been so close. But then he turned to the alternative.

If Mr. Biden winds up winning, Mr. Lubischer said he expected liberal politicians to incite street violence when their agenda was blocked by a Republican Senate. “It’s going to be actually worse,” he said.

For many, it was not the division itself that was so troubling. It was the source of that divide, a difference in values far too profound to be amenable to compromise. The election, for some of the most politically engaged, made it clearer that the only way forward was through more fighting.

The early leaders of the Democratic activists — the “resistance” — who mustered after the 2016 election are now veterans. Some of them were among the least shocked on Wednesday morning, even though they had been working toward this moment relentlessly for four years.

“It’s not 2016 anymore,” said Valerie Fleisher, 43, who in January 2017 was a founding member of a group in the Pittsburgh suburbs called 412 Resistance. “We’re not wringing our hands and saying, ‘How can this have happened?’ We know how this can happen. This is a very divided country right now and that division is based in racism.”

“This is going to be tough,” said Ms. Fleisher, now a member of her local school board. “We’re going to have to scratch out a win and then we’re going to have to fight like hell to protect the win, and any gains will be incremental and hard-fought.”

This lesson from Tuesday night — that one’s value system is in danger of being overrun without a fight — was shared across the political spectrum. The difference is which side appears to have the upper hand.

“I think the trend of our progressive culture is just overwhelming,” said Terry Leap, 45, a Baptist pastor in northern Kentucky.

He was no fan of Mr. Biden, considering him corrupt and in mental decline, and he did not like Mr. Trump, seeing in his demagogy a bad leader for conservatives. This has left him isolated, literally so on election night: Sequestered after a Covid-19 diagnosis, he watched the returns alone until 3 a.m. and then “went to bed very unsatisfied.”

What worried him most was a sense that aging social conservatives, though they appeared to put up a fight on Tuesday, were losing the ability to hold off an ascendant, secular left who had a very different conception of the country.

“This may be the last election that we see a very hotly contested electorate,” Mr. Leap said dejectedly. “I don’t think there is an optimism for the future.”

Others saw the possibility of healing, or at least civility. But it would take time.

Kameron Smith, 19, a sophomore at Morehouse College in Atlanta, voted for the first time, trading early support for Senator Elizabeth Warren for Mr. Biden. He woke up on Wednesday trying to make sense of an unresolved election.

Mr. Smith expected urban centers to go for Mr. Biden and figured rural areas would support Mr. Trump. What he did not anticipate was the anger some felt at the prospect of losing, describing the election as a fundamental fight over personal values — such as human rights versus capitalism — that had been forced out front by the pandemic.

He said it would take at least two terms for a president, any president, focused on unity to bridge what he described as two Americas.

“The last 24 hours showed me that America is not what we thought it was,” said Mr. Smith, a political science major who voted in his hometown, Newport News, Va.

“I feel like this is the beginning of something to the tune of the 1960s with massive protests in the streets, and maybe something close to violence,” he said. “There is just so much outrage that has been building over the last four years, and the skeletons are falling out of the closet.”

One of the main diagnoses of our national discord is that the warring halves of the country live and work in different places and watch competing news shows. But this is not entirely the case. There are plenty with strong views who have found themselves living among the other half.

Bryan Koehler, 55, manages a brewery with two locations in rural Western Pennsylvania, deep in the heart of Trump Country. A Republican who is aghast at how Mr. Trump has run things, Mr. Koehler keeps his opinions mostly to himself at the brewery and at the regular card games with old friends. They surely know what he thinks. But they also know not to ask about it.

“It’s like there’s something there that’s nagging that’s not right, the world’s not spinning the right way,” he said of living among people who see the world so differently. “And you ask yourself, ‘What am I missing here? Should I be seeing the world a different way?’”

Still, he does not see his beliefs about right and wrong changing, anymore than he sees his friends coming around to his views. And now, after this election reinforced what the half of the country he lives in truly wants, he will say even less.

“Get up tomorrow and keep going,” he said, by way of self-advice. “Take care of the things that you need to take care of over the next four years. And hope we start to head in a different direction.”

A Split Decision for Democrats,"[Joe Biden has won the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Read our story]

WASHINGTON — Americans who turned out in record numbers for the election were willing to weigh a change in course at the White House after four tumultuous years of President Trump, but the unfolding results showed that voters were not ready to hand unfettered control of the government to emboldened Democrats who had pledged to pursue an ambitious agenda if they triumphed.

Despite a record-setting fund-raising bonanza and a flurry of indications that voters were deeply dissatisfied with Mr. Trump, disappointed Democrats came up well short of their aspirations to seize clear control of the Senate and pad their numbers in the House. Instead, they watched gloomily on Wednesday as their path to the Senate majority narrowed while they absorbed unexpected losses in the House.

The split political decision underscored the reality that even as they turned away from the chaos of a divisive Republican president, voters wanted to hedge against Democratic hegemony in the nation’s capital and in statehouses around the country. Far from the so-called blue wave that many Democrats had imagined, the election was shaping up to be a series of conflicting squalls pointing in different directions that, above all, appeared to promise continuing division at all levels of government.

In some ways, the configuration could be tailor-made for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., should he ultimately prevail, which appeared increasingly likely on Wednesday. And it mirrored the decision that Democrats made this year in choosing Mr. Biden as their standard-bearer, elevating him over far more progressive contenders.

Mr. Biden sees himself as an old-school deal maker, someone who can operate in the more conventional political environment that voters seemed to be yearning for by delivering mixed outcomes like re-electing Senator Susan Collins, the centrist Republican from Maine, while delivering three of the state’s four electoral votes to Mr. Biden. But there are real questions of whether those old days of comity and compromise are gone forever.

Should Mr. Biden win, the victory of Ms. Collins and other Senate Republicans targeted by Democrats means he is likely to have to contend with a majority led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, a man with a recent history of using the majority to thwart Democratic presidents. The Biden-McConnell dynamic could force the new administration to scale back legislative goals on immigration, health care, the environment and economic policy. It could also compel Mr. Biden to negotiate with Republicans on his nominees for the executive and judicial branches, who would need to win Senate confirmation. Progressives who had been expecting big wins on Tuesday that would allow them to rush forward with bold new initiatives were headed for disappointment.

“Senate Republicans are going to be in a very strong position to steer the next two years,” said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, a member of the Republican leadership. “Nothing is going to become law without the support of Senate Republicans.”

It is an institutional arrangement that some believe could force the bipartisan bargaining that has been so absent in recent years. But it could also be a prescription for a continuation of the partisan paralysis that has held Congress in its grip.

Mr. Barrasso argued that Democrats had erred in believing that deep public dissatisfaction with Mr. Trump would enable them to knock off seasoned Republican incumbents, and that they had gotten ahead of themselves by publicly laying out plans to make sweeping changes that went beyond what most voters wanted. Those included threats to eliminate the filibuster, push through an aggressive legislative program and add seats to the Supreme Court to counterbalance the three justices Republicans had installed over Democratic charges of abuse of power.

“Their own members were talking about these things, and many Americans felt that was just too radical,” Mr. Barrasso said. “People saw this as scary.”

Republicans seized on the talk of court packing in particular, emphasizing it as a colorful illustration of ways Democrats could institute far-reaching changes in Washington, a prospect that evidently rattled some voters.

Democrats still held out hope on Wednesday of pursuing a long-shot path to Senate control, should Mr. Biden be elected and their candidates succeed in toppling Georgia’s two Republican senators in a pair of races that both appeared headed for runoffs in January. Still, as they contemplated falling short, Democrats argued that their main problem this year was simply political geography: To gain the majority, they had to unseat Republicans in states carried by Mr. Trump, when Senate races typically go in the direction of the state’s presidential race.

“The map was very difficult for us,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, who formulated the Democratic campaign strategy. He noted that Republicans had been defending seats in just two states carried by Hillary Clinton in 2016: Maine and Colorado. Mr. Schumer’s decision to try to expand the playing field to force Republicans to expend more resources and give Democrats a chance at the majority succeeded to a degree by putting more races in play. But it only went so far.

With the exception of Maine, where Ms. Collins defied the odds, the emerging presidential results appeared to be corresponding to the Senate outcome, with Democrats winning in Colorado, where Mr. Biden prevailed, and in Arizona, where he had opened a lead. But it meant that Republicans were able to survive well-funded Democratic challenges in states like Iowa, Montana and probably North Carolina.

Despite expectations in both parties that Mr. Trump’s presence on the ballot would hamper Republicans in competitive states and districts, the president appeared to have had substantial coattails in conservative-leaning states, turning out core constituencies to re-elect the incumbents crucial to maintaining the party’s hold on the Senate. In other areas where the president was weaker, such as Democratic-leaning Maine and more conservative suburban House districts nationwide, voters seemed to have stuck with the Republicans they knew rather than taking a chance on Democrats.

That was the case in the suburbs of Omaha, where Mr. Biden won a potentially crucial electoral vote, but Representative Don Bacon, a Republican, beat out a liberal Democratic opponent, Kara Eastman, to keep his seat. The story looked similar for the Republican veterans Ann Wagner of Missouri, Steve Chabot of Ohio and Rodney Davis of Illinois, all of whom held onto their jobs. And in New York, three Democratic challengers were trailing in their efforts to oust Republicans, while two first-term Democrats elected in the party’s 2018 midterm House sweep — Representatives Max Rose in Staten Island and Anthony Brindisi in Central New York — were in danger of losing.

Republicans gained ground partly by portraying Democratic challengers and incumbents — no matter how moderate — as socialists bent on forcing an extreme liberal agenda on their constituents, such as defunding police departments and enacting strict and costly environmental regulations.

“The suburban voter rejected the radical left,” said Corry Bliss, a top Republican strategist who was one of the many people who had warned of a grim environment that could cost his party House seats this year. “They respect cops, don’t want the Green New Deal and don’t want to be taxed to oblivion.”

The dynamic was playing out on a smaller scale across the country, as Democrats also fell short in their efforts to sweep statehouses that Republicans have controlled for years in Iowa, North Carolina and Texas, denying them crucial power over policy on issues like abortion, guns and police reform as well as control over the redrawing of state and national electoral maps.

During the campaign, Mr. Biden, who served as a senator from Delaware for more than 35 years, talked about his experience working across the aisle and suggested he could win over the half dozen or so Republicans needed to advance legislation. But that was provisioned on a Democratic majority, and on Wednesday, he was facing a situation where he could win the White House while Republicans still controlled the Senate. Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell have a history of hammering out agreements, but the terms did not always meet the approval of fellow Democrats.

Rahm Emanuel, who as White House chief of staff to President Barack Obama clashed with Mr. McConnell in 2009 and 2010, predicted that the Republican leader would not be able to replicate his strategy of relentless obstruction given the severe issues confronting the nation during a pandemic. And he noted that Mr. McConnell would need to protect Republican Senate candidates running in 2022 in states like North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin.

“He can’t run a scorched-earth policy again,” Mr. Emanuel said. “He knows that map is skewed against him.”

Asked on Wednesday in Louisville, Ky., how he would work with Mr. Biden, Mr. McConnell was not ready to concede the election. “I’m not sure whether I will need to or not,” he told reporters.

But as he closed out his campaign on Monday, Mr. McConnell made clear to chanting supporters that he had zero tolerance for some of the changes Democrats had hoped to institute.

“When it comes to things like ending the filibuster, D.C. statehood, Puerto Rican statehood, packing the Supreme Court, it will not come up in Mitch McConnell’s Senate,” he vowed. “I’m at the top of my game and ready for another term to not only deliver for Kentucky, but set the agenda for the nation.”"
"What We Know About the Vote in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania","[Read more on Joe Biden’s president-elect acceptance speech.]

The so-called blue wall states — Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — were long expected to play a pivotal role in the 2020 election, and that is indeed coming to pass.

By midday on Wednesday, Joseph R. Biden Jr. was declared the winner in Wisconsin and a few hours later he won Michigan. In Pennsylvania, President Trump had an edge, but large numbers of early votes and results from Democratic strongholds like Philadelphia were still being processed.

Mr. Biden won Wisconsin with a 20,000-vote lead over Mr. Trump. And he led with 67,000 votes ahead of the president to take Michigan. 

Here is a look at where things stand as the counting continues in Pennsylvania and how the races in Michigan and Wisconsin led to Biden victories.

Perhaps no state is staring down a longer counting period than Pennsylvania. As of midday Wednesday, 5.7 million votes had been counted in Pennsylvania, which represented roughly 80 percent of the estimated vote total in the state.

They got a late start. The state legislature refused to allow election officials to begin processing absentee ballots until 7 a.m. on Election Day, and officials across the state were laboring through the tedious process of counting ballots.

In Philadelphia, only 76,000 absentee ballots out of more than 350,000 were processed in the first 14 hours that officials were allowed to count ballots. Though Philadelphia election officials were working around the clock on the absentee ballots, the pace indicated that the count could last into Thursday.

Other major counties, like Chester, Montgomery and Delaware, suburban counties outside of Philadelphia and a growing source of strength for Democrats, also had not reported the majority of their mail-in ballots. Allegheny County, home to Pittsburgh and another Democratic base of support, still had a large share of ballots to count.

Senator Bob Casey Jr., a Democrat, said, “I’m confident Joe Biden will carry the state because of the margins we’ll get in those counties.”

Though Mr. Trump had a roughly 400,000-vote advantage in Pennsylvania, Democrats in the state were confident that they could make up the margins with votes from Philadelphia and the “collar counties” surrounding it still to be counted.

The delays in results in Pennsylvania, however, might extend beyond the simple challenge of counting the outstanding ballots. Republicans filed multiple lawsuits in the state on Tuesday, including one regarding provisional ballots for voters who had their absentee ballots rejected.

Early Wednesday, national Democrats filed a motion intervening in Montgomery County. Hearings were scheduled in both state and federal court on Republican lawsuits, and lawyers on both sides were anticipating further litigation in Pennsylvania.

Early returns were inconclusive on Tuesday evening, but Mr. Biden was declared the winner Wednesday afternoon, after key population centers such as Milwaukee reported its vote tally. The numbers trickled in early Wednesday morning, when a large vote count from that city was announced, and Mr. Biden edged ahead of Mr. Trump based on roughly 97 percent of estimated votes statewide. The final vote tally put the Democratic nominee ahead by about 20,000 votes — a similar margin to what Mr. Trump won the state by four years ago.

The state gives Mr. Biden one of his first victories in a state Mr. Trump won in 2016. The victory was powered by increased turnout in Madison, reaching a little over 75 percent, according to election officials. In Milwaukee, another of the state’s liberal strongholds, turnout seemed better than four years ago but not at the same high levels as in other major cities in battleground states from Arizona to North Carolina.

The state’s final total was much closer than many Democrats expected. Mr. Biden built a political campaign focused on Midwestern voters, aimed at clawing back many of the ideological moderates who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016. Still, Mr. Trump showed continued strength in rural and suburban areas, making the final vote margin much closer than many polls expected. 

Because of the small percentage between both candidates, Mr. Trump’s campaign announced it would seek a recount under state law. Democrats and Republicans officials, however, expected the state to stay within Mr. Biden’s column even after the legal challenge.

Mr. Biden took a slim lead in the state early Wednesday, as some of the state’s major population centers began reporting the large numbers of ballots that were cast early and unaccounted for late Tuesday. By early Wednesday evening, he was declared the winner in the state, remaining more than 67,000 votes ahead of Mr. Trump. 

Polls taken before the election had shown the former vice president considerably ahead, outside the margin of error. He won by 1.2 percentage points.

An earlier edge for Mr. Trump reflected his advantage in the Election Day vote — not the early vote, which was a larger share of the overall ballots cast in the state and favored Mr. Biden.

In Detroit, the city clerk had counted only about half of what was expected. The clerk’s office had reported having about 240,000 votes tallied by midday Wednesday. Later on Wednesday, more than 833,000 votes were reported.

For comparison purposes, Detroiters cast 248,000 ballots in 2016, when turnout was low. This year, election officials have said they expect turnout to easily surpass that, potentially exceeding 2008 and 2012, when President Barack Obama was on the ballot.

Mr. Biden won more than 67 percent of the vote in Detroit.

In Michigan’s bellwether Macomb County, which voted twice for Mr. Obama and then for Mr. Trump in 2016, the president was ahead with most of the ballots counted, but not by as much as he was four years ago when he carried it by more than 11 percentage points. Once Macomb counted its early and Election Day ballots, Mr. Biden was able to close a considerable gap, as he had in many counties throughout the day as the same-day ballots were counted first.

And in Oakland County, the state’s second-largest, what began as a significant lead for Mr. Trump on Tuesday evening vanished into an advantage for Mr. Biden by Wednesday as more and more precincts reported their early votes.

Democrats have won Oakland County in every recent presidential election. Hillary Clinton carried it by eight points in 2016, and Mr. Biden carried the county by 14 points."
Which Battleground States Did Trump Win in 2016?,"As results of the United States presidential election began to roll in on Tuesday, many Americans were wondering how President Trump’s performance in key swing states compared with his performance in those states in the 2016 election.

We can help with that. Here’s how Mr. Trump fared four years ago in six electoral battlegrounds:

Florida is diverse but conservative-leaning — and almost always close in presidential elections. Mr. Trump won the state in 2016 by a margin of 1.2 percentage points, even while losing some of its most populous counties.

Mr. Trump won North Carolina by 3.6 percentage points. The state has cities with large communities of moderate professionals, Black voters and college students, but also large rural regions where there tend to be more white voters who also tend to be more conservative.

The president narrowly took Wisconsin, a surprise flip in a state that President Barack Obama had claimed four years earlier by nearly seven percentage points. Mr. Trump lost the counties that contain the Democratic-leaning cities of Madison and Milwaukee, but managed to win over some rural Democrats.

Mr. Trump won Michigan by the narrow margin of about 10,000 votes, even though Hillary Clinton had polled ahead there for months. It was the first time the Republican Party won Michigan in a presidential race since 1988.

This former Republican stronghold has become a true battleground in recent years. Before the 2016 election, Democrats believed that they had a chance of flipping Arizona for the first time since President Bill Clinton carried it in 1996. But Mr. Trump won the state by 3.5 percentage points.

Mr. Trump narrowly won Pennsylvania on the strength of his performance in the deeply conservative and rural middle, even as he lost to Mrs. Clinton in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, two large Democratic cities.

Fox’s Arizona Call for Biden Flipped the Mood at Trump Headquarters,"WASHINGTON — With Florida looking red early on Tuesday night, President Trump and his advisers thought they were witnessing a repeat of election night 2016, when a victory in Florida foreshadowed a victory over all.

Inside the East Room, the mood was upbeat as hundreds of people, including cabinet secretaries, ambassadors and former officials who have remained loyal to Mr. Trump, mingled and dined on sliders and French fries. Officials who had been pessimistic about the president’s re-election chances suddenly started to picture four more years in power.

That mirage of victory was pierced when Fox News called Arizona for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. at 11:20 p.m., with just 73 percent of the state’s vote counted.

Mr. Trump and his advisers erupted at the news. If it was true that Arizona was lost, it would call into doubt on any claim of victory the president might be able to make.

What ensued for Mr. Trump was a night of angry calls to Republican governors and advice from campaign aides that he ignored, leading to a middle-of-the-night presidential briefing in which he made a reckless and unsubstantiated string of remarks about the democratic process. Standing in the East Room at 2:30 a.m., he dismissed the election as a “fraud” and claimed he wanted to stop the counting of votes and leave the results to the Supreme Court.

The Trump campaign knew Arizona could be up for grabs, but the Fox News call putting it in Mr. Biden’s column was symbolic, making it the first state that appeared to have flipped from the president’s 2016 batch of winning states. Gov. Doug Ducey, Republican of Arizona, had been on the phone all night with administration officials and campaign staff members, adamant that there were still Republican votes to be counted in his state.

Jason Miller, Mr. Trump’s political adviser, disputed the accuracy of the call on Twitter and frantically called Fox News, asking the network to retract it. He was unsuccessful. Instead of retracting it, the decision desk at Fox News doubled down on its call, putting Arnon Mishkin, the head of the desk, on air to defend the call. Several hours later, The Associated Press also called Arizona for Mr. Biden. (Other news organizations, including The New York Times and CNN, had not declared a victor by Wednesday afternoon because of absentee ballots that remained to be counted.)

Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, was also in touch with Rupert Murdoch, the Fox News owner, as the night wore on. And on Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, Bill Stepien, insisted the president would win Arizona by 30,000 votes.

Keeping Arizona in play was critical to the narrow path the campaign still saw to a victory on Wednesday, along with Georgia and Pennsylvania.

Mr. Trump spent much of Tuesday evening and early Wednesday watching election results roll in on Fox News from the White House residence, where he connected with several Republican governors on the phone. In conversations with Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas and Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, he asked about the possibility that fraud was being committed, according to people briefed on the call.

On Twitter, Mr. Ducey insisted that all the counting be completed before anyone else called the state.

Angry and feeling stung, the president and his aides watched as Mr. Biden gave a brief speech in Wilmington, Del., projecting victory for himself. “We feel good about where we are, we really do,” Mr. Biden told supporters, who honked their horns in support. “We believe we are on track to win this election.”

While Mr. Biden was speaking, the president tweeted for the first time all night, baselessly claiming that Democrats were trying to “steal” the election. In a follow-up tweet, he said that he, too, would deliver remarks. A podium with a presidential seal had already been set up in the East Room.

Mr. Trump’s advisers tried to persuade Mr. Trump to speak in the East Room before Mr. Biden made his remarks in Wilmington, but they were unsuccessful. Instead, they sat and watched as Mr. Biden set the tone for the night.

So it was hours before Mr. Trump actually appeared in the East Room. In the Oval Office, he huddled with aides who discussed how to frame the state of the race and whether he could declare victory or should take a more subtle tone.

He did not choose the latter approach.

“This is a fraud on the American public,” he told a crowd of supporters at 2:30 a.m., in remarks that were immediately criticized even by some of his allies, like Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor. The president continued: “This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win the election.”

As the map closed in on the Trump campaign on Wednesday, with Michigan and Wisconsin being called for Mr. Biden, the president was not seen in public all day. A Marine who stands guard in front of the West Wing doors when the president is in the Oval Office had not been spotted all day.

From the residence, Mr. Trump continued making calls to supporters and friends throughout the morning, sounding subdued and somewhat dispirited to some people. Outside the White House, finger-pointing about what went wrong had already begun. Some aides said that Mr. Trump had often resisted entreaties from Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, and Brad Parscale, his former campaign manager, and others to spend more time in Arizona. But they said he had resisted in part because he did not like traveling west and spending the night on the road.

Ms. McDaniel, however, disputed that she had harbored concerns about the president visiting Arizona, and said she was not involved in determining his campaign schedule, which was handled by his campaign.

They and several other aides had also tried and failed to get Mr. Trump to stop attacking an Arizona favorite son and war hero, Senator John McCain, a Republican whom the president has continued to criticize even after the senator’s death two years ago.

There were also questions as to whether, had the campaign not spent so much money before the coronavirus pandemic began, it might have had extra resources to spend in states where Mr. Biden had won or was leading by slim margins, like Wisconsin, Michigan and Nevada.

But others defended the early spending by Mr. Parscale, who among other things had focused on increasing the president’s turnout with Latino voters, who ended up being a key part of his support in Florida.

On Wednesday, the president’s family was heavily involved in efforts to question the validity of the vote tallies. Mr. Trump had joked at a rally that if he lost, he would never speak to any of his adult children again.

Mr. Kushner was making calls, looking for what he described as a “James Baker-like” figure who could lead the legal effort to dispute the tabulations in different states, according to a person briefed on the discussions. (Mr. Baker led George W. Bush’s successful recount case in 2000.) The president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was working out of the campaign headquarters in Virginia. Another son, Eric Trump, whose wife, Lara, has been heavily involved in campaign activities, spoke at a news conference in Philadelphia, alongside Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor.

“They’re not letting poll watchers watch the polls,” a visibly angry Eric Trump said, in a baseless attempt to cast doubt on the ballot counting still ongoing in Pennsylvania. Mr. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, also made the groundless assertion that the election in Pennsylvania was being stolen. He also floated the idea of a “national lawsuit” about allegations of fraud, but it was not clear what that meant.

For all of the president’s superstitions, and his attempts to surround himself with the team that helped lead him to victory four years ago, he found himself in a far weaker position this time. In the final weeks before Election Day, Mr. Kushner reassembled a group of people who had been involved in Mr. Trump’s first campaign, including the former White House deputy chief of staff, Katie Walsh, to work with Mr. Miller and others on the final weeks of spending on television.

But by Wednesday, several White House officials and outside advisers said they were hopeful, but not particularly optimistic, that Mr. Trump’s legal challenges in several states would be able to change the trajectory of the race. The president himself tweeted a suggestion that “a large number of secretly dumped ballots” had cost him Michigan, a message Twitter quickly labeled misleading."
"As the race tightens, chances of a protracted legal struggle increase.","As a resounding victory for President Trump or former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. appeared less likely, voters steeled themselves for prolonged, state-by-state legal battles over which ballots will be counted.

Both parties have already dispatched hundreds of lawyers, and the prospect of legal battles intensified on Wednesday as closely fought swing states counted mail ballots and President Trump warned that he would go to the Supreme Court to try to prematurely shut down the election.

No state was as closely watched as Pennsylvania. Republicans there filed twin lawsuits in state and federal courts on Tuesday trying to block efforts by some counties to allow voters to correct mistakes in their mail ballots, like missing signatures.

Also looming over the count was the prospect of the Supreme Court weighing in on a dispute over whether Pennsylvania can count mail ballots postmarked by Election Day that arrive within three days of Nov. 3, as it plans to.

The Supreme Court last week allowed Pennsylvania to keep its plan intact. But that decision could yet stoke further litigation: Some justices opened the door to reconsidering the issue, and state officials decided to segregate ballots arriving after Tuesday night.

By early Wednesday, there were hundreds of thousands of votes still to be counted in Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, many of them mail ballots that both sides expect to favor Mr. Biden. The margin remained tight in those states, which could tip the balance of the Electoral College.

It is still possible that a swing in the late count in those states could deliver such a clear-cut outcome that any legal action becomes moot.

But since early voting began, Republicans have already launched the most aggressive moves in modern memory to nullify ballots before they were counted. President Trump hewed to that strategy in saying early Wednesday that he would ask the Supreme Court to intervene to halt the legitimate counting of the vote, remarks that drew bipartisan condemnation.

But it was not clear how President Trump might appeal to the Supreme Court. There is no legal case compelling states to stop counting ballots that were properly filled out and submitted on time. And the high volume of mail ballots this year made protracted counting in some places, including battleground states, almost inevitable.

In Pennsylvania, it was not clear how many mail ballots could be affected by the Republican lawsuits filed on Tuesday. In one suit, Republican lawyers took issue with guidance given to counties across the state allowing voters whose mail ballots were at risk of being disqualified — because of missing signatures or secrecy envelopes, for example — to fix the problems or cast emergency ballots.

The main target of that lawsuit, the secretary of state, Kathy Boockvar, an appointee of Pennsylvania’s Democratic governor, defended the guidance Tuesday night. “We don’t think we broke the law,” she said.

The other lawsuit similarly revolved around rules allowing voters to correct their ballots, but only in Montgomery County, a suburb of Philadelphia. That case, which so far appears to affect only a small number of ballots, is to be argued on Wednesday."
Supreme Court and the Election: What We Know,"[Read more on Joe Biden’s president-elect acceptance speech.]

WASHINGTON — President Trump promised early Wednesday morning to ask the Supreme Court to intervene in the election. “We’ll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court,” he said. “We want all voting to stop.”

The first statement was premature. The second did not make sense.

The Supreme Court decides actual disputes, not abstract propositions, and then only after lower courts have made their own rulings. While there have been countless election cases filed around the nation, it is not clear which of them might reach the court in the coming days.

But one candidate is already on the court’s docket. Last month, the court refused to put a case from Pennsylvania on a fast track, but three justices indicated that the court might return to it later if need be.

On Wednesday afternoon, the Trump campaign asked the Supreme Court for permission to participate in the case alongside Republican state lawmakers and the Republican Party of Pennsylvania. The court has not said whether it would hear the case or when it might decide whether to grant review.

As far as voting is concerned, it stopped on Election Day. But some states allow votes cast by mail on or before Election Day to be counted if they are received up to several days afterward. In Pennsylvania, for instance, the state Supreme Court extended the deadline for receiving ballots from Election Day to three days later.

Should the vote in Pennsylvania have the potential to determine the outcome in the Electoral College and should those late-arriving ballots have the potential to swing the state — two big ifs — the U.S. Supreme Court might well intercede.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has ordered a three-day extension for ballots clearly mailed on or before Election Day and for those with missing or illegible postmarks “unless a preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that it was mailed after Election Day.”

Late last month, on Oct. 28, the justices refused a plea from Republicans in the state to fast-track a decision on whether the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had acted lawfully.

The court’s refusal to move more quickly came a little more than a week after it deadlocked, 4 to 4, on an emergency application in the case on Oct. 19.

Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh said they would have granted a stay blocking the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s decision. On the other side were Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and the court’s three-member liberal wing: Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who joined the court on Oct. 27, did not take part in the decision not to fast-track the case. A court spokeswoman said Justice Barrett had not participated “because of the need for a prompt resolution” and “because she has not had time to fully review the parties’ filings.”

The U.S. Supreme Court has not hesitated to block orders from federal judges that sought to alter state rules for conducting elections. Rulings from state courts present more difficult questions because the Supreme Court generally defers to them in cases concerning interpretations of state law, while the Constitution empowers state legislatures to set the times, places and manner of congressional elections.

In a statement issued when the court refused to speed the Pennsylvania case, Justice Alito, joined by Justices Thomas and Gorsuch, criticized his court’s treatment of the matter, which he said had “needlessly created conditions that could lead to serious postelection problems.”

“The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has issued a decree that squarely alters an important statutory provision enacted by the Pennsylvania legislature pursuant to its authority under the Constitution of the United States to make rules governing the conduct of elections for federal office,” he wrote, adding that he regretted that the election would be “conducted under a cloud.”

“It would be highly desirable to issue a ruling on the constitutionality of the State Supreme Court’s decision before the election,” Justice Alito wrote. “That question has national importance, and there is a strong likelihood that the State Supreme Court decision violates the federal Constitution.”

But there was not enough time, he wrote. Still, Justice Alito left little doubt about where he stood on the question in the case.

“The provisions of the federal Constitution conferring on state legislatures, not state courts, the authority to make rules governing federal elections would be meaningless,” he wrote, “if a state court could override the rules adopted by the legislature simply by claiming that a state constitutional provision gave the courts the authority to make whatever rules it thought appropriate for the conduct of a fair election.”

Pennsylvania officials have instructed county election officials to segregate ballots arriving after 8 p.m. on Election Day through 5 p.m. three days later. That would as a practical matter allow a ruling from the Supreme Court to determine whether they were ultimately counted.

Justice Alito’s statement in the Pennsylvania case echoed an earlier concurring opinion by Justice Kavanaugh in a voting case from Wisconsin. Justice Kavanaugh also said that state legislatures, rather than state courts, have the last word in setting state election procedures.

Taken together, the Oct. 17 deadlock and statements from four justices suggest that Justice Barrett could cast the decisive vote if the Pennsylvania dispute holds the key to the election."
"Republicans Tighten Hold on Senate, but Control Could Be Decided in Runoffs","[Joe Biden has won the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Read our story]

Republicans, buoyed by an unexpectedly strong performance by President Trump in key battlegrounds, grew increasingly confident on Wednesday that they could maintain narrow control of the Senate and make a considerable dent in the size of the Democrats’ House majority.

Their chances in the Senate were vastly improved by the come-from-behind victory of Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a New England centrist largely written off as a loss before Election Day. Ms. Collins’s resounding performance in a state also carried by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. defied national trends and she avoided a protracted fight involving the state’s ranked-choice voting system by clearing a 50 percent threshold of support.

Democrats, who had entered the night bullish about their chances, had flipped only two seats, in Colorado and Arizona. And with the loss of Senator Doug Jones, Democrat of Alabama, they were still two or three seats short of the gains they would need to control the chamber.

Their hopes increasingly rested on Georgia, where at least one race was headed for a January runoff with a Democrat as front-runner. Votes in the state’s other contest were still being counted, but Democrats were hopeful that Senator David Perdue, a Republican, would have to contend with a runoff, as well.

If they prove successful, it would provide Democrats with a shot at fighting Republicans to a draw for control of the Senate in a bloody and expensive rematch just two weeks before Inauguration Day. Two Democratic victories there would split the Senate, 50-50, and if Mr. Biden prevailed, his vice president, Kamala Harris, could cast tiebreaking votes to give Democrats de facto control.

Republicans had scored crucial Senate victories in Iowa, Montana, South Carolina and Texas, where Democratic challengers fell well short of expectations despite spending record-breaking sums. They likewise believed they were strongly positioned to hold on in North Carolina as well, where Senator Thom Tillis was considered one of the party’s most endangered senators this year, though the race was still too close to call with mail-in ballots streaming in.

“If my math is correct, if we win in North Carolina and Maine, I am still the offensive coordinator,” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, told reporters on Wednesday, referring to his position as majority leader.

The fight carried heavy consequences for whoever wins the White House, given that the Senate holds sway over judicial nominations and the legislative agenda, with the power to advance or frustrate a president’s plans. Even as they continued to game out possibilities, Democrats emerged on Wednesday decidedly downcast.

“I was hoping we would sweep to victory with a number of Senate wins,” John Hickenlooper, Colorado’s former Democratic governor who defeated Senator Cory Gardner, said on MSNBC. “You know we were cautiously optimistic, but it’s not the level of excitement I was hoping to wake up to.”

In the House, Democrats were on track to secure the 218 seats needed to maintain the majority they established in 2018. But their predictions of a second consecutive wave powered by antipathy for Mr. Trump had been dashed by Wednesday morning. Instead, Democrats had lost a handful of historically more conservative rural and suburban seats in Oklahoma, South Carolina, New Mexico and Florida and were praying that a late deluge of mail-in votes would minimize further loses in places they once thought safe.

Republicans’ run of victories also promised to replenish somewhat the number of women in their conference, which was decimated in Democrats’ 2018 sweep. 

“I’ve heard for months from the pollsters and the media about how Republicans were going to lose more seats and cling to shrinking coalitions,” Representative Kevin McCarthy of California said at an upbeat news briefing in Washington promoting the new women in his conference. “We expanded this party that reflects America and looks like America.”

The accumulating results suggested that Mr. McCarthy could wield considerably more leverage in the House next term, particularly if Republicans hold the Senate. He quickly announced a run for minority leader and was expected to consolidate support. A smaller Democratic majority thinned of some moderates could also empower the party’s progressive wing to exercise more force.

In a letter to Democrats, Speaker Nancy Pelosi conceded it had been “a challenging election” but tried to put a positive spin on a clearly disappointing outcome. She predicted victory for Mr. Biden and said House Democrats were positioned to work with him “to deliver” health care changes, anticorruption legislation and “green infrastructure” — though a Republican-controlled Senate would have very little interest in making that possible.

Privately, House Democrats who survived were licking their wounds and contemplating whether leadership changes needed to be made at the party’s campaign committee. The losses stung.

In South Carolina, Representative Joe Cunningham, a first-term Democrat, was defeated by Nancy Mace, the first woman to graduate from the Citadel, in his Charleston-based district. With Mr. Trump making significant inroads among Cuban-Americans, two other Democratic freshmen were ousted by Republicans in Miami: Representatives Debbie Mucarsel-Powell lost to Mayor Carlos A. Gimenez of Miami, and Representative Donna E. Shalala was defeated by Maria Elvira Salazar, a former television anchor.

In the increasingly conservative rural Midwest, Representative Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota, the Democrat who oversees the Agriculture Committee and has served in the House for three decades, was also toppled.

The battle for the Senate was being waged on even friendlier turf for Republicans. Though they were defending 23 states, compared with just 12 for Democrats, almost all of them were places that Mr. Trump carried in 2016.

Democrats still managed to win in Colorado, a rare liberal-leaning state occupied by a Republican, and Arizona, where Mark Kelly, a former astronaut, beat Senator Martha McSally, handing her a second Senate defeat in two years. They also narrowly hung on in Michigan, where Senator Gary Peters beat John James, a Black Iraq war veteran and a Republican.

But Tommy Tuberville, the former Auburn football coach, easily won back deeply conservative Alabama from Senator Doug Jones. In Iowa, Senator Joni Ernst’s victory over Theresa Greenfield, a Democrat with roots in the state’s farming community, scuttled Democrats’ hopes for a key pickup. And in Montana, Steve Daines beat back a challenge from the state’s popular Democratic governor, Steve Bullock.

In North Carolina, Mr. Tillis had opened a lead of nearly 100,000 votes on Wednesday against Cal Cunningham, the Democrat and Iraq war veteran who had led in polls for much of the year before being dragged down by revelations of an extramarital affair. But the state accepts mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day until Nov. 12, making a final call premature.

Among all the victories for Senate Republicans, Ms. Collins’s stood out as the most remarkable. Facing an onslaught of liberal outrage over her 2018 vote to confirm Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court amid accusations of sexual assault, she trailed the Democrat, Sara Gideon, the speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, in the race’s closing weeks.

In the end, she proved she was one of the few senators in the country still able to significantly outrun the top of the ticket, winning her fifth term even as Mr. Trump lost badly in Maine to Mr. Biden.

Still, already eying a 2022 Senate election on more difficult turf for Republicans, Mr. McConnell suggested there were reasons for the party to worry, as well.

Speaking to reporters after his own commanding victory in Kentucky, he said Republicans had pressing work to do to win back the support of women and college-educated voters, as well as to bolster their fund-raising apparatus, which has trailed Democrats’ juggernaut, ActBlue.

“I am disturbed by the loss of support in the suburbs nationwide,” Mr. McConnell said.

Democrats still remained hopeful about the races in Georgia. The Rev. Dr. Raphael G. Warnock, a Democrat, was headed for a January runoff against Senator Kelly Loeffler, the appointed Republican, in a special election to replace Senator Johnny Isakson, who retired in late 2019 citing health problems. Jon Ossoff, 33, a documentary filmmaker, was in a tight race to unseat Mr. Perdue, which could also end up in a runoff if neither cleared the 50 percent threshold required under Georgia law to win outright.

Democrats had one other outstanding target, Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska, but it was considered a stretch.

How to Follow the Election Results,"[President Trump’s campaign vowed to continue challenging the election results even after Joe Biden won.]

It’s not exactly hard to find election coverage: You can pretty much look in any direction and it’ll be there. But the volume can be its own obstacle, making it difficult to cut through the commotion and find the specific information you’re looking for.

Here’s a guide to The Times’s coverage, no matter when, how or how often you want to consume it.

There will be a results map on The New York Times’s home page throughout the night, with states colored blue or red as they are called for Joseph R. Biden Jr. or President Trump. You’ll be able to click on any state for more details.

Unlike on Election Days past, however, uncalled states will not be colored light blue or pink based on who is leading. That’s because the huge partisan split this year between mail-in ballots and in-person ballots is likely to skew the early results. A lead for either party in the initial count may be very misleading, so states won’t be colored until they’re officially called.

And yes, the infamous needle will be back — but only for Florida, Georgia and North Carolina, because they’re the only swing states that are providing granular enough information for our experts to make educated projections of uncounted votes.

Times reporters are live-blogging all day and night. This will be your one-stop shop for minute-by-minute updates: race calls, on-the-ground reporting from swing states, news about any voting issues or disruptions, and more.

Reporters will also be publishing frequent, brief analyses of how the night is unfolding.

A separate group of Times journalists will be producing a 2020 election live briefing from roughly 5 p.m. to 3 a.m. Eastern time. It will give you an overview of what’s happening in a variety of areas: the presidential race, Senate races, House races and the voting process itself.

This briefing won’t be as detailed or as fast-paced as the live-blog, but it will be updated regularly throughout the night so that every time you check in, you’ll be able to get up to speed quickly on what happened while you were gone."

It’s Wednesday, and this is your politics tip sheet. Today, there’s only one big tip we can think to offer: Be patient. Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.

An election season defined by anxiety appears likely to drag on for another few nerve-racking days. How fitting.

The resounding, across-the-board victory that Democrats had hoped they might see last night — encouraged by their strong showing in the 2018 midterms, and yet another year of overly favorable polls — never materialized.

At the same time, what at first blush may have seemed as if it was shaping up to be a surprisingly robust Republican showing was actually much less certain. The first ballots to be counted in many states were those cast on Election Day, giving an illusion of Republican mega-strength that will probably erode across the board as more mail-in ballots are counted.

And so now, we wait.

Of course, that’s not what President Trump wants us to do. He got onstage at the White House around 2:30 a.m. and unleashed an attack on the country’s very democratic institutions.

“We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election,” he said, falsely claiming that the early returns gave him an insurmountable lead and baselessly calling the vote-counting process “a fraud on the American people.” He declared — alarmingly — that he intended to bring his complaints to the Supreme Court, with its newly strengthened conservative majority, and ask it to stop counting ballots.

“We’ll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court,” he said. “We want all voting to stop. We don’t want them to find any ballots at 4 o’clock in the morning and add them to the list, OK? It’s a very sad moment.”

Joe Biden appeared to see this coming — and indeed, Democrats had worried about such a scenario occurring in a tight race. By the time Trump spoke, Biden had already pre-empted the president, giving his own remarks over an hour earlier at a drive-in event in Wilmington, Del. In a brief address, partly off the cuff but mostly off a teleprompter, Biden declared himself optimistic and insisted that every vote must count.

“I’m here to tell you tonight, we believe we’re on track to win this election,” he said. “We knew because of the unprecedented early vote and the mail-in vote, it was going to take a while. We’re going to have to be patient until the hard work of tallying the votes is finished. And it ain’t over until every vote is counted, every ballot is counted.”

Republicans yesterday did win closely contested Senate races in at least two states, Alabama and Iowa, and flipped at least six House seats, giving them a four-seat net gain in that chamber so far.

But Democrats also picked up two Senate seats, in Colorado and Arizona, and close races remain uncalled in North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan and Maine — most of them potential Democratic pickups. The party’s path to a Senate majority may have narrowed somewhat, but the fate of the chamber, it’s safe to say, still hangs in the balance.

Based on the states that have already been declared, Biden needs 43 more electoral votes to get to the golden number of 270, and Trump needs 57.

The three Northern states that flipped for Trump in 2016 — Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania — remain uncalled. So do North Carolina and Georgia, both of which went for him in 2016 but have been heavily targeted by Democrats this cycle, and both of which are double-whammies: They have contested Senate races hitched to the presidential contest.

In many of these still-uncalled states, Trump holds the lead in terms of ballots counted — but that could easily change as more mail-in ballots and some in-person votes continue to be tabulated.

In Georgia, as Biden mentioned in his speech, Democrats are feeling bullish. Many more votes are yet to come in from the Atlanta area; in DeKalb County, for instance, one of the state’s largest, early in-person votes had not even begun to be counted until last night.

In Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, votes were not allowed to be counted until yesterday morning, so it could take at least another day for all ballots to be tabulated.

One lesson that we learned — well, relearned — last night is that polls cannot be trusted to predict the outcome of an election. Prepare yourself for a lot of articles about this fact.

Yet another reminder of this verity arrived via the exit polls, when two separate voter surveys yesterday showed some widely diverging results.

The traditional exit polls, conducted by Edison Research on behalf of a consortium of news organizations, showed that Trump was neck and neck with Biden among white college graduates, including a virtual tie among white women with college degrees. This was in defiance of almost every major poll before the election.

The Associated Press and NORC’s new, ambitious, 140,000-interview voter survey, VoteCast, had results that were more in line with expectations: Biden was ahead among white women with college educations by more than 20 points, even as Trump managed to pull closer to even with him among white college men.

This was only one of many points of departure between the traditional exit polls, which tended to show results slightly more favorable to Trump across the board, and the new A.P./NORC study.

As you get ready for a season full of polling takes, expect these voter surveys to be a major focus of discussion and hand-wringing.

Can Biden Still Win? Yes. Here Are the Remaining Paths.,"[Joe Biden has won the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Read our story.]

[Can President Trump still win? No. He’s already lost.]

This article was published before the election was called for Joseph R. Biden Jr.

Joseph R. Biden Jr. has moved much closer to the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the White House with victories in Wisconsin and Michigan on Wednesday, leaving President Trump largely playing defense on a shrinking, if still viable, battleground map.

Mr. Trump’s path, as of late Wednesday, centered on his winning Pennsylvania’s 20 Electoral College votes — in conjunction with other scenarios that involve holding Georgia, erasing Mr. Biden’s lead in Arizona and flipping Nevada, the shakiest state in Mr. Biden’s map.

On Tuesday night, Mr. Biden’s team watched nervously as the campaign’s what-if states — Florida, Ohio, Texas and North Carolina — quickly broke for the president. But by early Wednesday, it was the former vice president, and not the current president, who went on offense, gathering momentum in his effort to recapture Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, once reliable “blue wall” states.

By Wednesday afternoon, The Associated Press had declared Mr. Biden the winner in both Wisconsin and Michigan as Democratic areas of those states began reporting more results.

With those victories, Mr. Biden now has two clear and plausible paths to victory:

He could win Pennsylvania, a state that seemed to be swinging to his advantage as the count of early and mail-in balloting began.

Or, if he holds on in Nevada, he could take Arizona — which has already been declared a Biden victory by some news organizations even though hundreds of thousands of votes remain to be counted.

Mr. Biden even has a third path, less likely than the other two, but still viable: Winning both Nevada and Georgia, where an influx of mail-in ballots from Atlanta and its suburbs cut into what seemed like an insurmountable Trump lead late Wednesday.

If he were to pick up either Arizona or Georgia along with Nevada, winning Pennsylvania would be unnecessary.

In a call with reporters early Wednesday, Mr. Biden’s team expressed confidence that the former vice president would win by taking the “easy” path, along the old “blue wall” in the Midwest and Appalachia.

That had seemed less plausible late Tuesday, when Mr. Trump jumped out to a 700,000-vote lead in Pennsylvania. But many ballots remained to be counted, and absentee voting in particular was expected to favor Mr. Biden because many Democratic voters made use of mail balloting during the coronavirus pandemic.

Republicans are expressing confidence Mr. Trump will ultimately prevail in Arizona, but Mr. Biden retained a slim edge there, and the president’s aides privately conceded that a Biden win there would deal a devastating blow to their chances of winning nationwide.

A Biden victory in Arizona, coupled with a win in Nevada, would put him at precisely 270 electoral votes — sans Pennsylvania.

“Joe Biden’s path is largely unchanged since he entered this race,” Guy Cecil, the chairman of Priorities USA, a leading Democratic super PAC, said early Wednesday. “There are still at least five competitive states giving him multiple paths to 270. It may take a couple of days to count the votes, and we may need to fight the Trump campaign in court, but Joe Biden remains the favorite.”

Mr. Trump’s victories in Florida, Ohio and Texas did not create a new path for him so much as close off new shortcuts by which Mr. Biden could have claimed victory on Election Day. His last chance for a flip is Nevada, another tight race, but one in which most of the uncounted votes are generally expected to favor Mr. Biden.

Otherwise, Mr. Trump’s path to winning a second term probably depends on holding onto Pennsylvania, which he narrowly won in 2016; retaining Georgia and North Carolina; and winning either Arizona or Nevada.

“Trump’s path is exactly the same as it was in 2016,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who is a veteran of Senator Marco Rubio’s campaigns. “He needs to overperform in some traditionally blue states. Trump wins when the voters Democrats take for granted no longer reliably vote for Democrats.”

In Nebraska — one of two states, along with Maine, that split their electoral votes by congressional district — Mr. Biden won the state’s Second Congressional District, which includes Omaha. The Nebraska Democratic Party chairwoman, Jane Kleeb, declared victory early Wednesday.

“Omaha is now Joe-maha,” she said.

Because Mr. Biden won that lone Nebraska electoral vote, it kept open the path that allows him to win Arizona and Nevada and reach exactly 270 electoral votes."
What We Know About Election Results in California,"Good morning.

If there’s one thing we can know for certain today, it’s that a lot of Californians — millions upon millions, more than the populations of many states — voted. (Also, that Joseph R. Biden Jr. won the state easily.)

Around 13.4 million ballots had already been cast, Paul Mitchell, vice president of the bipartisan data firm Political Data Inc., told me early on Tuesday evening, “and that’s not counting a lot of the ballots that are coming in right now.”

[Find results for all the California races.]

“Raw voter turnout is going to exceed anything the state’s ever seen,” he said.

Still, you might not have known that California was in the midst of a democratic deluge from the looks of voting centers on Election Day.

[After warnings it could go off the rails, the election actually ran smoothly.]

Mr. Mitchell said that according to projections, the final vote count could be between 16 and 17 million, with roughly two million likely to be in-person votes at the polls.

While there were reports of long lines in the Sacramento area and Riverside County, the mood at the polls seemed largely to range from serene to festive.

Voters across the state sought out memorable places to play their part in democracy, from Dodger Stadium to a famous leather bar in San Francisco — a marked contrast from the March primary, when hourslong waits frustrated voters, particularly in the state’s most populous county, Los Angeles.

In Oakland, voters cast their ballots al fresco with a nice view of Lake Merritt. Workers used tongs to take ballots from voters in their cars.

“We get a lot of jokes, like, ‘Can I have a side of ribs with that?’” one election worker told my colleague Thomas Fuller.

At Crenshaw High School in South Los Angeles, where the Los Angeles Lakers had sponsored a voting center, my colleague Tim Arango reported that voters saw Tuesday as a day for hope.

[Here’s background about key races in California.]

I decided to head to Porter Ranch in the San Fernando Valley, where I visited voting centers at a charter elementary school tucked among winding blocks of ranch houses framed by golden hillsides, and at a large church hall near a sprawl of upscale strip malls.

The day was quiet, and election workers at both sites said they’d seen a steady flow of voters dropping off or casting ballots over the course of several days. Some voters had taken advantage of the state’s same-day registration process.

The election workers said that they encountered virtually no issues with voters wearing masks or following other rules.

I thought I’d be able to catch voters with strong preferences for either of the candidates for state’s 25th Congressional District seat, the Democratic State Assembly member Christy Smith or the Republican incumbent Mike Garcia, who as of early Wednesday morning were still locked in a very close battle.

But voters I spoke with said they were most focused on the top of the ticket, in spite of the fact that Mr. Biden’s victory in California was essentially a foregone conclusion.

They said they looked to trusted organizations — one voter I spoke to cited the California G.O.P. and another mentioned the progressive organization KNOCK.LA — for guidance on ballot propositions.

If they didn’t skip local races altogether, they said they followed party affiliation.

“I didn’t vote in 2016,” Parvin Moosavi, 56, told me, as she stood outside Castlebay Lane Charter Elementary School. “But I think everyone should exercise their vote to kick him out.”

She was referring to President Trump.

Ms. Moosavi said she’d supported Senator Bernie Sanders previously, and while she was disappointed that he wasn’t the Democratic candidate, she felt strongly that Mr. Biden could help restore the middle class and better control the pandemic.

A health care worker, Ms. Moosavi said she’s lived in the United States for decades after moving from Iran. But she has family in Europe and if the president were re-elected, she would move there.

Outside of a voting center at InChrist Community Church not far away, Irwin Lehrhoff, 91, told me that in 2016 he voted for the president in hopes of seeing “a businessman, not a politician,” in the White House. On Tuesday, though, he cast a vote for Mr. Biden.

“It was just too many lies on Covid,” he said. “You can’t have a president you can’t trust.”

On the rest of his ballot, Mr. Lehrhoff, a Porter Ranch resident, said he “pretty much followed the Republican Party.”

Votes are still being counted in California, and will be for days. But with roughly 73 percent of votes reported, some of the races have been called, according to The Times’s tracker.

As with other states, Mr. Mitchell said mailed votes tended to skew Democratic, whereas in-person voters were more likely to be Republican. But, as we’ve mentioned, many of the biggest debates the state faced don’t split along clear partisan lines.

Here’s where things stand:

Proposition 17, aimed at restoring voting rights to people on parole for felony convictions, passed.

Proposition 20, an effort to crack down on some types of misdemeanor crimes and roll back some sentencing reforms, failed.

Proposition 21, which would have expanded local governments’ ability to enact rent control, failed.

Proposition 22, the astronomically expensive effort by gig companies to exempt themselves from a new labor law that would require them to treat workers as employees, passed.

Proposition 23, an effort to require more oversight of dialysis clinics, failed.

The rest, including some key ballot questions and crucial House races, were still too close to call. We’ll have more soon on what the results mean.

Photos From The 1960s: Black Americans Voting For the First Time,"[Race/Related is available as a newsletter. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox.]

Today marks the conclusion of a fraught political season like no other, with the denouement coming amid deep divisions over the future of the country and a coronavirus pandemic that has claimed more than 230,000 American lives. It also has come in the wake of a number of police killings, which sparked tremendous unrest and demonstrations against systemic racism and police brutality.

As the polls opened this morning, more than 100 million people had already cast their ballots in mail-in votes and in-person early voting. In many cities across the South, where hundreds of polling sites have closed over the last decade and lawsuits have been filed contesting the purging of voter rolls, it meant waiting in long lines for hours.

Near Atlanta last month, at the Gallery at South DeKalb in Decatur, Norman Robinson III stood in a line that snaked for more than a half-mile. Still, he said, “it’s an awesome thing.”

“My parents were jailed in college during the 1960s for exercising their rights to vote,” said Dr. Robinson, an educator specializing in math, science and technology. “This is in my blood to make sure I honor and continue their fight for voices to be heard.”

It wasn’t all that long ago — just 55 years — when Black Americans could not easily vote. The Voting Rights Act, signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965, banned the use of literacy tests and challenged the use of poll taxes, among other hindrances that had made it difficult to register.

Today, as the nation awaits results in what has turned out to be a historic election in a historic year, we look back at the Black Americans who stood in the rain and the scorching Southern sun to cast their very first ballots and, ultimately, to finally have their voices heard.

"
A QAnon Supporter Is Headed to Congress,"QAnon scored its first national political victory on Tuesday when Marjorie Taylor Greene, a supporter of the convoluted pro-Trump conspiracy theory, won a House seat in Georgia, bringing into the halls of Congress an online movement that has inspired real-world violence and been branded a potential domestic terrorism threat by the F.B.I.

Ms. Greene was among at least a dozen Republican congressional candidates — some estimates put the number upward of 20 — who had expressed some degree of support for QAnon and its baseless belief that President Trump is fighting a cabal of Satanist child-molesting Democrats and deep-state bureaucrats who seek global domination. Most were running for reliably Democratic seats.

Ms. Greene’s victory was expected — she was running unopposed in one of the most conservative districts in the country — as were losses by most of the other QAnon-linked candidates. None of the results altered what by now has become apparent inside and outside the Republican Party: This is the year conspiracy theories, QAnon foremost among them, gained a new foothold in the party.

The influx of QAnon-linked candidates was only the most high-profile example of how a phenomenon that began on the troll-infested fringes of the internet had moved offline and into American political life, enabled by Mr. Trump’s own espousal of conspiracy theories and continual railing against the political establishment. The question now is whether the election represents the beginning of QAnon’s political rise or its high-water mark. Much will depend on how Mr. Trump fares.

A Trump victory would be an unqualified boon “that could cause the ranks of QAnon followers to swell,” said Travis View, who hosts “QAnon Anonymous,” a podcast that seeks to explain the movement.

A Trump loss would be more complicated. QAnon has proved incredibly elastic, absorbing older conspiracy theories and bouncing back after one or another of its predictions failed to materialize. If anything, QAnon followers may come to see a victory for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as proof that the deep state is so powerful it managed to take down a president.

At the same time, few envision Mr. Trump, unshackled by any constraints of office, doing anything to tamp down such talk, though the rest of the party’s leaders may no longer be willing to sit by as he makes wild claims or enables conspiracy theorists.

“You can’t be a successful national party and simultaneously peddle conspiracy theories,” Alex Conant, a Republican consultant who has overseen communications strategy on Senate and presidential campaigns, said in an interview.

QAnon’s future would then be likely to hinge on how deeply the movement had seeped into the party, and whether the Republican establishment could win back the conspiracy theory’s adherents — by no means a certainty. The movement is unabashedly pro-Trump, casting the president as something of a god-emperor figure and painting much of the Republican old guard as little better than the Democrats.

While it is hard to pinpoint how many Republican voters feel that way, there is growing evidence that QAnon followers make up a small but significant minority inside the party. The movement’s growth has picked up pace since the onset of the pandemic, and in a recent poll by YouGov,fully half of the Trump supporters surveyed said they thought powerful Democrats were involved in elite child sex-trafficking rings, a core tenet of QAnon.

Mr. Trump has done little to discourage QAnon’s followers. He has described QAnon adherents — several of whom have been charged with murder, domestic terrorism or planned kidnapping — as “people that love our country.” His children have posted social media messages related to the conspiracy theory, and aides have made barely disguised appeals to its followers. The most recent came last week when Stephen Miller, a top Trump aide, claimed without evidence that Mr. Biden would “incentivize” child trafficking if elected.

“It has been given oxygen by the president,” said Brendan Buck, a former counselor to the last two Republican House speakers, Paul D. Ryan and John A. Boehner. “He’s had many opportunities to shut it down and just chose not to.”

Beyond Mr. Trump’s circle, most Republican leaders have done little to stop QAnon’s spread within their ranks. If anything, some party leaders, desperate to maintain their grip on the Senate and not lose further ground in the House, have at times quietly acquiesced to QAnon’s rise.

Lauren Boebert, a House candidate in Colorado who made approving comments about QAnon before distancing herself from the movement, defeated a five-term Republican incumbent in a primary in June and won her race on Tuesday.

Angela Stanton-King, who was expected to lose her bid for a House seat in a heavily Democratic district in Atlanta, repeatedly posted QAnon content and obscure hashtags like #TrustThePlan, and yet attracted campaign contributions from the Republican National Committee and the Georgia Republican Party. Jo Rae Perkins, a Republican Senate candidate in Oregon, declared in May, “I stand with Q and the team.” and later posted a video in which she took what has become known as an oath for QAnon digital soldiers. She was similarly expected to be defeated.

Among the others expected to lose on Tuesday were candidates like Mike Cargile, who was one of a number of QAnon-linked Republicans to challenge incumbent Democrats in California for House seats. His Twitter bio includes #WWG1WGA, a shortened version of the QAnon motto “Where We Go One We Go All.”

Elsewhere, Ron Weber, a West Point graduate and lawyer in Ohio who beat three other contenders in a primary and has shared QAnon hashtags and conspiracy theories on social media, lost his race on Tuesday.

But it is Ms. Greene, the victorious candidate in Georgia, whose candidacy has exemplified the party’s difficulties in handling its QAnon problem. Now that she is headed to Congress, the party must decide what to do with her.

“I think she will start off with a pretty short leash,” Mr. Buck said.

Even so, he added, there is a fundamental problem: “There is no real establishment or party leadership in the way that there used to be,” and so “members of Congress have realized that there is an open playing field to be whoever you want if you can get attention for yourself.”

Ms. Greene, who owns a construction company, has called QAnon “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles out.” She has also made derogatory remarks about Black people, Jews and Muslims.

Nearly every elected Republican in Georgia’s 14th Congressional District, where Ms. Greene was running for an open House seat, lined up to oppose her after she trounced eight other candidates in the June primary and forced a runoff. But not everyone in the party was as unwelcoming. Mr. Trump posted a congratulatory tweet after Ms. Greene’s strong showing in June, and two of his highest-profile supporters backed her: Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio and Mark Meadows, the former congressman who is now the White House chief of staff.

Whatever objections others had seemed to melt away after Ms. Greene won the runoff in August. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House minority leader, said she would be given committee assignments if elected. Senator Kelly Loeffler, who was appointed by the governor last December and is seeking a full term in a special election in Georgia, readily accepted Ms. Greene’s endorsement.

Ms. Greene, for her part, has recently sought to distance herself from her most controversial views. Asked about QAnon in an interview with Fox News, she said she had chosen another path. She also tweeted that she had now accepted that the Pentagon had been hit by a hijacked plane on Sept. 11, 2001, not a missile.

But, she added, “The problem is our government lies to us so much to protect the Deep State, it’s hard sometimes to know what is real and what is not.”"
"The Coronavirus, Raging in Battleground States, Looms Over Election Day","CLEVELAND — They voted from cars and at outdoor tables. They stood in lines spaced far apart. They strapped on masks and pumped sanitizer into their palms. All across America on Tuesday, voters cast ballots in a presidential election in which the uncontrolled coronavirus pandemic was both a top issue and a threat.

As millions of Americans turned out to vote, the nation was facing a rapidly escalating pandemic that is concentrated in some of the very states seen as critical in determining the outcome of the presidential race. From Wisconsin to North Carolina, infections were on the rise as the nation barreled toward 10 million total cases.

The virus that has left millions of people out of work and killed more than 230,000 people in the United States will be one of the most significant challenges for the winner of the presidential race, and it loomed over every chapter of the election, down to the final ballots.

In the last hours of campaigning, President Trump — who, regardless of the election outcome, will be in charge of the nation’s response to the pandemic for the next two and a half critical months — was at odds with his own coronavirus advisers and suggested that he might fire Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. told voters in a final pitch that “the first step to beating the virus is beating Donald Trump.”

In Virginia, voters’ temperatures were taken at some polling sites. In Wisconsin, the mayor of Wausau, a small city where cases are spiking and tensions are high, issued an order banning guns at polling places. And in Texas, an election judge did not wear a face covering, prompting accusations of voter intimidation and such intense heckling that the judge called the local sheriff to report that she felt unsafe.

The pandemic, which drove record numbers of Americans to cast ballots early or by mail, rarely strayed far from voters’ minds.

“I just don’t want another shutdown,” said Rachel Ausperk, 29, a first-time voter who said she chose President Trump in Ohio, a highly contested state that reported more new coronavirus cases on Tuesday than on any day since the nation’s outbreak began more than eight months ago.

In Miami, Eddie Gil, 50, said that he, too, had been guided by concerns about the coronavirus and how it was being handled. He said he voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 but chose Mr. Biden this year, in part because of the president’s handling of the pandemic.

“The government has failed all the small businesses,” said Mr. Gil, who opened a gym in January but said the pandemic forced him to close. “I’m very disappointed,” he added. “I thought putting a real estate businessman in office would drain the swamp.”

The coronavirus outbreak shaped nearly every aspect of the 2020 election, and only intensified as voters went to the polls. The United States shattered records in recent days, reporting more than 85,000 new cases a day, nearly double the caseload at the start of October. Deaths have increased slowly to more than 800 daily, more than in early July but far fewer than in the spring. Though the country is conducting more testing, that does not fully account for the increase in cases.

In a collision of two powerful forces shaping 2020, the virus was raging most ominously across political battlegrounds around the Great Lakes. Several swing states recorded records or near highs on Tuesday, including Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which have all announced more cases over the last seven days than in any other weeklong period during the pandemic.

In Wisconsin, a prize eyed by both parties, more than 100,000 virus cases have been reported in the past month, and deaths and hospitalizations have spiked, leaving many to fear that worse news could be ahead.

Voters who entered a polling location in Kenosha, Wis., first passed a handwashing station outside the front doors. Then there was a kiosk of free masks, wipes and hand sanitizer just inside the lobby. The room where they voted was a large, airy gymnasium with tables spaced at least 15 feet apart.

David Sconzert, a poll worker, said he carefully considered whether to show up on Election Day at all. A cancer survivor, he said he tested positive for the coronavirus in early October yet feared he did not have the immunity that would prevent him from catching it again.

“I almost called it off,” he said. “But then I just thought, ‘No. I’m taking a chance.’”

Inside a community basketball gym in Cleveland, poll workers fastened on masks and sat down behind cardboard and plastic shields that encased them on three sides. Looking more like a row of bank tellers, they greeted voters, who were expected to give an electronic signature by slipping on disposable plastic finger shields and then guiding their hands under a narrow opening. Voter booths, spaced out around the gym, had been meticulously measured with a six-foot rope.

Raven Payne, a 25-year-old first-time poll worker, had one job all day: sanitation. Dressed in a bright yellow vest, plastic gloves, a face mask and a face shield, she had a distinctly buglike appearance as she hovered around the room, swooping in to clean, wipe and scrub each booth in between voters.

A mile away, about 40 people sick with the coronavirus were lying in beds at the main campus of the Cleveland Clinic. Across Ohio, more people are hospitalized with the virus than at any other time during the pandemic; around the country, more than 50,000 people were in a hospital with the coronavirus on Tuesday, up 67 percent from a month ago.

When Americans found themselves voting in the middle of the 1918 flu pandemic, infections also surged in October, peaking around Election Day. After voters turned out for the midterm elections that year, deaths continued at a fairly high rate throughout November and into December. At the same time, some places were lifting restrictions on public gatherings and people were flocking to the streets to celebrate the armistice ending World War I, two factors that contributed to new infections.

This year, experts are hopeful that the flood of mail-in voting and precautions at the polls will protect Election Day gatherings from becoming superspreader events. But with cases soaring nationwide and health officials overwhelmed, it may be difficult to determine in the coming weeks what effect voting may have had.

The next few weeks are seen as crucial for controlling the pandemic, as colder weather forces people indoors and families gather around the table at Thanksgiving.

No matter the outcome of the election, one person will be in charge of the nation’s Covid-19 response through the next critical period: Mr. Trump.

The president, who was hospitalized for the virus in October, has largely shut down the White House Coronavirus Task Force, and in recent days downplayed the country’s spiraling cases, saying that the nation is “rounding the corner.”

Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, issued an urgent plea on Monday for an “aggressive balanced approach that is not being implemented,” in a private memo that was earlier reported by The Washington Post.

In many places, voters and poll workers took extraordinary measures on Tuesday to try to protect themselves. They wore American-flag-themed masks, used napkins to drop off votes in ballot boxes and even passed ballots with the help of salad tongs.

“People just love the tongs,” said Tommy Nickerson, a ballot worker in Oakland, Calif., where workers in face masks used tongs to collect ballots from drive-through motorists. Across the street, people cast ballots at tables set up outside.

Some thought the virus — and all the precautions — was overhyped.

“I don’t think it’s as big as they say,” said Ann Roth, a 57-year-old voter from Papillion in suburban Omaha, who cast her ballot for Mr. Trump. “People are going to do what they’re going to do.”

In Michigan, another key swing state that Mr. Trump carried by a razor-thin margin four years ago, Democrats were focused on driving up turnout in Detroit. The pandemic was especially devastating for the city.

“It hit us like an atomic bomb,” said Ronald Lockett, the executive director of the Northwest Activities Center, where there was a line out the door to vote on Tuesday.

Mr. Lockett said he had the coronavirus this year, had to cut his staff during the pandemic, and had lost hundreds of thousands of dollars because he had not been able to hold events. He cast his vote for Mr. Biden, he said, in large part because he hoped the former vice president would guide America out of the pandemic.

“This election,” he said, “is going to determine the future of Covid.”

"In These Suburbs, Long Lines Were Good News for the President","UPPER ARLINGTON, Ohio — In an affluent pocket of Upper Arlington, a suburb of Columbus, dozens of voters, masked and socially distanced, spanned the length of Jones Middle School and the block behind it by the time the polling place opened Tuesday morning.

[How the suburbs voted for Biden and Trump in the 2020 Election.]

For years, Carolyn Mislan, 55, has cast her ballot at this school, first thing in the morning on Election Day. In the past, she’s been in and out in 10 minutes. But on Tuesday, when she arrived just a few minutes before 6:30 a.m., she found an hourlong wait ahead of her. “It’s never been like this,” she said of the turnout.

On its face, the long line was good news for President Trump. Across the nation, his support has cratered in places like Franklin County, where Upper Arlington is located, with its seven-figure homes, boutique fitness centers and largely white, college-educated electorate. In 2016, Mr. Trump lost nine of the 10 most affluent suburbs in Franklin County, many of which, like Upper Arlington, were longtime Republican strongholds.

But Mr. Trump won, barely, Ms. Mislan’s precinct in 2016. His support there may not have mattered so much then, when he won Ohio handily, but with the state now a toss-up, his margins in well-heeled neighborhoods like hers — small Republican islands in large suburban counties that have been trending Democratic — may be critical.

Mr. Trump’s ability to repeat, if not exceed, his performance among suburban supporters could determine his success in other battleground states as well. On Tuesday afternoon, there were reports of steady turnout in other prosperous suburban areas, from Wisconsin’s Waukesha County to Bucks County in Pennsylvania, whose votes in 2016 helped Mr. Trump break through the so-called blue wall of Northern industrial states that had favored Democrats in presidential elections since the 1990s. But it was far from clear whether that would be enough for the president.

Republicans were hoping that a surge of Trump voters at polling places on Tuesday would help offset the Democrats’ predicted gains in absentee and early voting. In Ohio, for example, officials announced on Monday that a record-shattering 3.4 million such votes had already been cast. In Michigan, more than 2.8 million ballots were mailed in and accepted as of Monday.

Republican officials said they were most encouraged by unexpectedly high turnout in the suburbs of South Florida. For months, the Trump campaign has poured resources into Miami-Dade County, which Hillary Clinton won handily in 2016, but where Mr. Trump has tried to run up his support among Cuban-Americans in key suburban towns.

Back in Ohio, like other voters who patiently endured lines in Franklin County’s still-Republican patches, Ms. Mislan, a schoolteacher, was eager to do her part. “I feel like his platforms are more suited to my beliefs,” she said of the president. She was worried about how the oil and gas industry would be affected by a victory for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

In Bloomfield Township, Mich., where homes often sell for well over $1 million and Republicans have long dominated local politics, there was ample evidence of a strong showing for Mr. Trump on Tuesday.

At Birmingham Covington School, where one of the largest precincts in the township votes, the wait was already nearly an hour long before 8 a.m. Before noon, almost 350 of the roughly 1,100 people who were eligible to cast ballots there had voted, according to data from the township and the tally kept by workers at the polling site.

“I’m surprised,” said Dawn Kramer, who decided she needed to make a Starbucks run first once she saw the line was about 200 people deep. “In prior years we’d come in and there’d be three other people in there with us.”

Ms. Kramer voted for Mr. Trump, as it appeared most of her neighbors did at Covington on Tuesday. As a Catholic, she said, abortion is her paramount concern: “I vote with the church, that’s my thing.” And like many of her neighbors, Ms. Kramer said she was set on casting her ballot in person because it was familiar and felt more secure.

“I’m concerned about voter fraud, frankly,” she said. “I want it to count. And I want to see it go in the machine.”

Oakland County, where Bloomfield is located, was once a Republican stronghold. But in an indication of how much it has changed, Mitt Romney lost the county to President Barack Obama by eight points in 2012, even though he grew up in neighboring Bloomfield Hills and his father, the former Gov. George Romney, had a house there until he died. Four years later, Mr. Trump also lost Oakland by eight points.

Hugh Carney, a Bloomfield resident who works in wealth management, was insistent about voting in person. “I think it’s a terrific right. We should appreciate it. It took an hour. I’ve got an hour,” he said, his face covered by a mask emblazoned with the logo of a nearby country club.

Mr. Carney pointed to the economy as a major motivator in casting his ballot for Mr. Trump. Citing Mr. Biden’s proposal to raise the corporate tax rate to 28 percent from 21 percent, he pulled out his phone to display an email predicting that Mr. Biden’s election would cause the value of the S&P 500 to drop by more than 10 percentage points.

The country is in a precarious place, he said. “I think there’s concern — more concern every day. You’ve got politics. You’ve got Covid. You’ve got China. And then the market opens.”

The Republican Party has long relied on well-to-do suburbanites who believe their economic interests will be better served by fiscally conservative policy prescriptions like tax cuts and deregulation. But Mr. Trump’s presidency has accelerated the flight of wealthy, college-educated white voters into the Democratic Party and made Republicans more reliant on turning out voters in rural areas where organizing is more difficult and more expensive.

Moderate Republicans who used to represent affluent districts in Congress have been swept out of office. Nationwide, the 10 congressional districts with the highest median household incomes are all represented by Democrats, who have benefited from the support of voters who have mobilized since 2017 with an almost single-minded purpose to defeat the president. Carrying precincts in Bloomfield, as Mr. Trump did in 2016, may not be as helpful to him if the bigger shifts in the suburbs hold.

But on Tuesday, many voters in suburban battleground precincts seemed to confirm Republicans’ theory that fears of widespread fraud in voting by mail — fears that Mr. Trump has stoked repeatedly, and for which there is no evidence — would make Election Day itself the party’s best show of support. According to a spokesman for the Ohio secretary of state, that state is on track to surpass six million total votes — nearly one million more than in 2016 — by the end of Tuesday.

At Columbus Preparatory Academy in Franklin County, Ohio, the polling station in another precinct that Mr. Trump won by a narrow margin in 2016, Mercedes Romine, 38, said she was voting in person in part because “you just can’t trust anybody anymore,” referencing charges of voter fraud.

But Ms. Romine, who planned to cast her ballot for Mr. Trump, said she also believed that voting in person — waking up early, standing in line — was an essential part of the democratic process. “It’s not supposed to be convenient and easy,” she said.

“All the rumors about absentee ballots — I don’t know how much is true or not, but I thought I’d show up in person just in case,” echoed Morgan Huhl, 23, after leaving the polling station. “Plus, I wanted the real experience.”

It was Ms. Huhl’s first time voting in a presidential election, and owing to the president’s “financial policies,” she said, she had cast her inaugural ballot for him.

The large showing for Mr. Trump at polling places in Bloomfield on Tuesday offered the clearest sign yet of the depth of his support in the enclave, where not many residents had erected displays of their fealty to the president on their large, well-maintained lawns.

But Chris Nichols was anything but demure in his choice of voting-day attire. Mr. Nichols, who is self-employed, showed up wearing a Make America Great Again mask and a Trump-branded scarf. Because of the state’s ban on campaign-related materials inside polling places, however, poll workers asked him to turn the mask inside out.

He refused. “And I got more positive feedback than dirty looks,” he said. “Maybe it’s the neighborhood.”

This Is It. Here’s What I’m Watching.,"Welcome to On Politics. We made it to election night, together. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host.

Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.

ORLANDO — We are finally here. The final lap of this extraordinary election. And yes, it could be a long lap. The first polls are starting to close, but it remains far from certain when we’ll learn the outcome of the race.

It’s not finishing in the way anyone might have expected when we boarded this crazy ride on Dec. 31, 2018 — the day Senator Elizabeth Warren became the first candidate to announce her exploratory committee. (Who remembers? We do!)

The road has been long. It’s certainly been weird. And we learned that democracy can be awfully messy. But we made it.

Everyone, exhale. The only thing left is to count the votes.

Like everything in 2020, it won’t be easy. No one really knows how long it will take to get a winner — hours, days, weeks? — but I’m hopeful that we’ll get some hints on how the race is going early in the evening.

There are plenty of places in Ohio, Georgia, North Carolina and Florida to watch as the early returns roll in. Here are some I’ll be keeping an eye on:

Indiana’s Fifth Congressional District: This Indianapolis-area district is historically Republican, but like many suburban areas is trending blue. Over the past month, the House race here to replace a retiring Republican congresswoman has moved toward the Democratic candidate. If Democrats pick up the seat, it’s a good sign for their performance in suburbs across the country — in congressional races and in the presidential race.

Polls have already started to close in the district, and many Indiana counties expect to report full results tonight. So this is a smart place to watch for early clues about the national mood.

Florida, Florida, Florida: You all already know how much I love this kooky swing state. Voting locations in this queen of all the battlegrounds close relatively early in the evening, and early voting and mail ballot results are expected between 8 and 8:30 p.m. Eastern time.

The obvious county to watch is Miami-Dade, the state’s biggest. Democrats are worried about turnout and support from Black and Latino voters there. Also keep your eyes on Sumter County, the home of everyone’s favorite political reporting cliché: the Villages, where about 120,000 mostly retired people live. If there are indications that the traditionally Republican Midwestern transplants are going blue, that’s a good signal for Democrats in Florida and by extension the Rust Belt.

Lake County, Ohio: Even though Joe Biden added a last-minute stop in Cleveland on Monday, few Democrats expect him to win Ohio, which has been trending Republican in recent cycles. But Lake County could still give us a sense of where the suburbs are going.

President Trump won this county east of Cleveland by 15 percentage points in 2016. Closer margins this year would reassure Democrats about their prospects in the three states once known as their “blue wall”: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

There will be plenty more to come tonight and into tomorrow morning. Follow along with our live reporting and analysis on nytimes.com.

You can keep tabs on our best-in-the-business results pages (if we do say so ourselves), our (in)famous “needle” forecast of where things are headed, our live news updates, and much more.

Oregon Decriminalizes Small Amounts of Heroin and Cocaine; Four States Legalize Marijuana,"[Cheers erupt on New York City streets after President-elect Joe Biden’s victory is declared.]

OAKLAND, Calif. — The march to decriminalize drugs moved further across the nation on Tuesday despite continued federal prohibition.

Oregon became the first state to decriminalize small amounts of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and other drugs. And in New Jersey, South Dakota, Montana and Arizona, voters decisively passed laws legalizing recreational marijuana. Cannabis is now legal across a large bloc of states in the West — from Washington down to the Mexican border — and well beyond.

Cannabis was also on the ballot in Mississippi. If all of the marijuana measures pass, marijuana will be legal for medical use in three dozen states and recreational use will be allowed in 15.

The Oregon measure makes possession of small amounts of what have long been considered harder drugs a violation, similar to a traffic ticket, and no longer punishable by jail time. The law also funds drug addiction treatment from marijuana sales taxes.

“This is incredible,” said Kassandra Frederique, executive director of the advocacy group Drug Policy Alliance. “This is like taking a sledgehammer to the cornerstone of the drug war.”

Possession of larger amounts could result in misdemeanor charges, and some cases that rise to what is considered a commercial level could still be charged as felonies.

Ms. Frederique said passage of the measure showed that voters were eager for a new approach on drug policy to handle it as a health issue and prioritize treatment. She said she expected other states to follow suit, mentioning efforts in states such as California, Vermont and Washington.

Separately, Oregon voters also legalized psilocybin, known as magic mushrooms, for people age 21 and older. Proponents said the move would allow the drug to be used to treat depression, anxiety and other conditions.

Even in a year when the number of citizen initiatives in states across the country was sharply down from the last presidential election, the diverse slate of measures offered a chance to gauge the mood of the nation.

In California voters decided to maintain a ban on affirmative action. The ban, passed in 1996, applies mainly to public employment, education and government contracts. It prohibits state and local governments from granting preferential treatment on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin.

In Florida, where the two presidential candidates were within a few points of each other, voters decisively approved a pro-labor amendment to the Constitution that will raise the minimum wage incrementally to $15 an hour by 2026.

Florida becomes the eighth state to enact a minimum wage of $15, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, but it is the first state that Donald J. Trump carried in the 2016 presidential election to do so. The District of Columbia has also enacted a $15 minimum wage.

Florida’s measure, known as Amendment 2, earned a place on Tuesday’s ballot last December and needed at least 60 percent of the vote to pass. With 99 percent of ballots counted, the measure had slightly more than 61 percent in favor.

Under the measure, the state minimum wage will rise to $10 an hour next September from the current rate of $8.56, and then will increase by another $1 each September through 2026. After that, annual increases would be tied to inflation.

A study by the Florida Policy Institute, a research organization backing the increase, found that the higher wage would directly benefit 2.5 million workers in the state.

The amendment was supported by unions and the Miami-Dade Democratic Party and was opposed by business organizations representing construction companies, citrus farmers, hotels and restaurants.

In a defeat for labor advocates, however, California voters passed Proposition 22, a measure promoted by gig-economy companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash that allows them to treat their drivers as independent contractors, rather than as employees entitled to a variety of protections under state labor law.

In Illinois, voters defeated an amendment championed by Gov. J.B. Pritzker that would have increased tax revenue by replacing the state’s flat income tax of 4.95 percent with graduated taxes that would range from 4.75 percent to 7.99 percent. The defeat could lead to a downgrading of the state’s credit ratings to junk status.

In Louisiana, a measure supported by two anti-abortion Democrats, Gov. John Bel Edwards and State Senator Katrina Jackson, passed comfortably. Amendment 1 adds these words to the State Constitution: “Nothing in this constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion, or require the funding of abortion.”

But in Colorado, voters soundly defeated a proposal to ban abortions after 22 weeks of gestation.

Two measures addressed historical legacies. In Mississippi, voters approved a new state flag with red, yellow and blue stripes, a magnolia flower and the words “In God We Trust.” The state’s previous flag, which dated to 1894 and contained a Confederate battle cross, was decommissioned by lawmakers in June. And in the Northeast, voters agreed to change the official name of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations to simply Rhode Island. Supporters of the change said the reference to plantations resonated with the painful legacy of slavery.

Those in favor of overhauling criminal justice were victorious on two measures in California. Voters approved Proposition 17, which will restore the right to vote for felons on parole, and they rejected Proposition 20, which would have rolled back earlier measures that allow early parole consideration for people convicted of certain felonies. Both measures were supported by former Gov. Jerry Brown.

Voters in California also rejected a law that would have abolished cash bail and replaced it with computer-driven risk assessment of a suspect. Opponents of the law included California chapters of the N.A.A.C.P., who argued that the algorithms that will decide who is allowed pretrial freedom may work against people of color and those from poorer areas.

There were 38 statewide citizen initiatives being decided across the country on Tuesday, about half as many as in 2016, when there were 72. Experts attribute the decline to the effect of the coronavirus pandemic, which has made gathering signatures more difficult. When all measures are accounted for, including those placed on the ballot by legislatures, there were a total of 124 statewide ballot initiatives this year, down from 154 four years ago.

But even in a year with fewer initiatives California had many substantive ones. In a measure closely watched by the technology industry, voters agreed to establish a stand-alone state privacy watchdog, the first in the nation to do so.

The measure, Proposition 24, is intended to strengthen and clarify the California Consumer Privacy Act, a sweeping new law that took effect this year and gives people in the state the right to see, delete and stop the sale of the personal information that companies have compiled about them. Once the new agency is set up, it will be in charge of enforcing the consumer privacy law.

"Despite Fears of Violence, Election Day Proceeds Smoothly as Millions Line Up to Vote","WASHINGTON — Despite fears of widespread intimidation or disruptions at polling places, voting for a vast majority of Americans proceeded smoothly on Tuesday, with sporadic reports of robocalls, text messages and some live calls meant to confuse and deter voters, or scattered incidents, but few major problems.

“It’s definitely a relief so far,” said Daryl Johnson, a former senior analyst with the Department of Homeland Security who focuses on domestic terrorism. But he warned that “the period after the election is going to be more volatile and higher risk because you’re going to be dealing with the aftermath of the election results.”

By early evening, most of the complaints around the country concerning intimidation centered on robocalls made to voters relaying false information. The Election Protection Hotline said it received reports of robocalls from 17 states discouraging voting.

The Michigan attorney general, Dana Nessel, said in a tweet that callers were directing voters to delay going to the polls to avoid long lines. “Obviously this is FALSE and an effort to suppress the vote. No long lines and today is the last day to vote,” Ms. Nessel said. “Don’t believe the lies! Have your voice heard!”

The robocall complaint came on top of live calls to voters in Michigan that threatened voters in Flint and Grand Rapids with arrests if they showed up to the polls, and a text message sent to voters in Dearborn that warned of ballot “sensor” malfunctions in the voting precincts. The message, which the state attorney general’s office is investigating, told voters that if they wanted their vote for their preferred presidential candidate to count, they actually had to mark the ballot for the other candidate.

The F.B.I. also confirmed the robocalls.

“As a reminder, the F.B.I. encourages the American public to verify any election and voting information they may receive through their local election officials,” the agency said in a statement.

In Michigan, voters also started receiving disturbing, typo-filled text messages that claimed to come from the F.B.I.

The messages, which were sent to voters in Dearborn — which has the largest concentration of Muslims per capita in the United States — read, “Urgent alert: Due to a typographical error, scantron ballots being used for the 2020 election has swapped sensors. If you are intending on voting for Joe Biden you must bubble in Trump and vice verse. — Federal Berue of Investigation.”

A spokeswoman for the Michigan attorney general’s office said officials were still trying to track down the sender. The office sent out an urgent alert on Facebook and Twitter to make sure voters in Dearborn did not fall for the scam.

In Virginia, Kristen Clarke, the president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said robocalls went out warning voters that they might get sick if they went out to vote. “Stay home and stay safe,” the calls said.

The robocalls were similar to those reported in Michigan, Texas, California, Florida, Kansas, Ohio, Washington, Georgia, New York, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania on Tuesday. Zignal Labs, a media analytics firm, tracked more than 14,248 mentions of robocalls on social media on Tuesday, the vast majority of them in Michigan, Kansas and Florida.

The “stay home and stay safe” robocalls had started during the campaign and were continuing during voting, Ms. Clarke said. Voting rights groups said voters in several other states had gotten similar calls directing them to vote on Wednesday, Ms. Clarke said.

All told, more than three million calls were made to some 800,000 people across the country on Tuesday, instructing them to “stay safe and stay home,” according to data provided by the firm TelTech.

A senior homeland security official said such robocalls were common during elections and intelligence officials said there did not seem to be any early indications that the calls were originating from a foreign government. But Gen. Paul M. Nakasone, the director of the National Security Agency, said that his agency would “take a very close look” at the calls, and said that he was confident the F.B.I. was “on top of it right now.”

Homeland security intelligence warned last month that extremists could look to target “physical election infrastructure” like polling sites. Federal officials and local police officials on Tuesday continued to prepare for possible unrest going into election night, with the Homeland Security Department deploying tactical agents from Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, throughout the United States to protect federal property. A new fence had been erected in front of Lafayette Square, near the White House.

The agents deployed by the Homeland Security Department are directed to guard federal buildings, not conduct immigration enforcement. Such homeland security tactical teams were also the subject of a report issued by the homeland security inspector general on Tuesday that said the agency had sent the teams to quell protests in Portland, Ore., without the proper authority or training. The Homeland Security Department disputed the finding.

During a news briefing focused on cyberthreats, Christopher Krebs, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, encouraged Americans to be patient through Election Day. “Keep calm, vote on, and then after today keep calm and let them count,” Mr. Krebs said.

Bob Bauer, a former White House counsel who is helping to lead the Biden campaign’s election protection efforts, said that the campaign was seeing “minimal issues and disruptions” around voting, and that “by and large, voting is proceeding smoothly.”

Still, a few random acts of violence or intimidation did pop up. In Chicago, a man told the police that a group had clubbed his car with baseball bats as he drove near a polling site, according to Sally Brown, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Police Department.

An armed man wearing a Trump hat, combat boots and a visible sidearm was arrested upon returning to a North Carolina polling place after being barred earlier in the day, according to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department.

The police identified the man as Justin Dunn, 36. They said in a statement that he voted at the site but “continued to loiter” afterward, prompting a call to the police “regarding Dunn possibly intimidating other voters.”

The staff at a museum in Kansas City, Mo., moved to cover up a spray-painted message reading “Don’t Vote.”

In Dallas County, Texas, a dispute over masks forced a Democratic election judge and several voters to leave a precinct out of concern for their health.

Just as voting was set to begin on Tuesday, Beth Biesel, a Republican election judge, told her Democratic counterpart, Lynn Dickinson, that she and her appointed poll workers refused to wear masks. In Texas, two election judges are appointed to each polling site — a presiding election judge by the majority party and the alternate judge by the minority — to set up polls and ensure the security of the ballots.

Ms. Biesel previously joined a Texas activist in filing a lawsuit last month challenging Dallas County’s mask requirement for poll workers. The Texas Supreme Court denied their request.

On Tuesday, Ms. Biesel showed up without a mask anyway, in what Ms. Dickinson and one nonpartisan poll watcher described as a political statement.

“This was a small crowded room with a poll judge and poll workers who were aggressively getting in people’s faces and not wearing masks,” said Joanna Grossman, a nonpartisan Dallas County poll watcher. “It was very much a staged event. Unfortunately, they were not there to process voters.”

Despite the relative calm during voting, law enforcement officials across the nation nonetheless remained on high alert on Tuesday. Election Day came after a weekend in which caravans blocked roadways and there was an increase in threats made online and at the close of a bitterly divisive election.

Retailers and banks from Boston to Washington to Los Angeles searched for beefed-up security. Disney and Saks Fifth Avenue were among the brand-name stores in Manhattan that boarded up their windows. And Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills was closed for Election Day and the day after.

How Biden’s Discipline on Rebuilding the ‘Blue Wall’ Moved Him Close to Victory,"[Read more on Joe Biden’s president-elect acceptance speech.]

For Joe Biden, it has always been about Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

From the start of his presidential campaign until the final day of the race on Tuesday, the self-described “scrappy kid from Scranton” believed that rebuilding the Democratic “blue wall” in those states would not only be his strongest path to the White House but also critical for a party that long drew strength from working-class and middle-class voters in the region.

Now, with Mr. Biden edging ahead of Mr. Trump in a nail-biter of an election, the former vice president’s disciplined approach to winning back those Northern industrial states — rather than getting distracted by Democratic dreams of a blue Texas — appears to be paying off. Wisconsin and Michigan flipped back to the Democrats on Wednesday, moving Mr. Biden closer to winning 270 Electoral College votes.

His path to victory could well go through Pennsylvania, which Democrats lost in 2016 for the first time in a quarter century and Mr. Biden, a native son, seemed most determined to claim. But his victories in Wisconsin and Michigan also give him the latitude to take the White House with wins in Arizona and Nevada, where he was ahead in the vote counts on Wednesday night.

Georgia, another state where Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump are running closely, has been a tantalizing target for Democrats in recent years, fueled by fast-changing suburbs. Mr. Biden made a real play for the state, with advertising and visits by former President Barack Obama and others, but he did not spend a lot of time there at the cost of the blue-wall states.

“It was critical to his success to win those three back, not only for his presidency but also for the party,” said former Mayor Michael Nutter of Philadelphia. “We can continue to try to make gains in Florida, we can continue to push Texas and Arizona and Georgia down the line. But those three are key Democratic strongholds.”

Mr. Trump campaigned aggressively in Michigan, Wisconsin and especially Pennsylvania. But Mr. Biden’s focus was notable: Many presidential nominees take their eyes off their most critical states, but Mr. Biden never lost sight of trying to win back voters in those three states who abandoned the party four years ago.

“If I’m going to beat Donald Trump in 2020, it’s going to happen here,” Mr. Biden, the former vice president, told voters in Pittsburgh during the first address of his primary campaign in April 2019.

After midnight on Wednesday, he declared to supporters, “It’s going to take time to count the votes, but we’re going to win Pennsylvania.”

Who would have known we were this patient?” [cheering] “I really feel that this election is very important, very vital to the country.”

His discipline is relatively rare in presidential politics — candidates, often times Democrats, usually get swept up with a big map conquest, like Hillary Clinton’s intense focus on Florida in 2016 and even her dalliances with Arizona and Utah.

But this race was no ordinary contest: Like voters, activists and officials in his party, Mr. Biden was haunted by the narrow loss in 2016 of 80,000 votes in the three traditionally Democratic states that cost the party the White House that year.

In the last days of the election, Mr. Biden’s campaign and allies privately maintained that he could win battleground states across the country, including places like North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia. But, they argued, the trifecta represented their easiest — though perhaps not fastest — path to the presidency. Final returns in all three states are expected to take days, and Mr. Trump tried early Wednesday to set the narrative that Democrats were trying to “steal the election” — a groundless assertion.

But the Biden camp wasn’t about to take the bait.

“We believe that we are well positioned in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin,” Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, said on Monday in a briefing about election night. “We know those states in particular are coming in later, but we think we’re going to win those states. That is our clearest path to victory.”

Although Mr. Biden visited Arizona and Georgia, his campaign had declined to spend a lot of precious time and money in those states — despite repeated pleas from local Democrats. And when two Democratic billionaires, Dustin Moskovitz and Michael R. Bloomberg, poured money into Texas in the 11th hour, Mr. Biden dispatched only Senator Kamala Harris of California, his running mate, to the state.

Even that was more attention than Democrats were accustomed to getting from the national party in the traditionally conservative Western states. In Arizona, a state that Mr. Biden visited just once as the party’s nominee, officials said they were satisfied with the campaign’s approach to the state.

“They spent a lot of time here; they put in a lot of energy and attention, more than previous campaigns,” said Representative Ruben Gallego, who represents the fast-growing Phoenix area. “And if we win, it doesn’t matter.”

In total, Mr. Biden spent $57.8 million on advertising in Texas and Arizona. He spent nearly three times as much — $169.2 million — in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

The decision to focus on the industrial trio was driven by the practicalities of political math. Mrs. Clinton lost those states by tight margins, making them fertile ground for Democrats to begin a comeback. Just winning those three states, along with holding all of the traditionally Democratic strongholds won by Mrs. Clinton, would capture the presidency for Mr. Biden.

But it was also a calculation born of cultural affinity. Despite his decades in Washington, Mr. Biden sees himself as a working-class son, just another “middle class Joe” taking the train to work like any other commuter.

“Joe, people like him, they don’t dislike him,” Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan said in an interview this fall. “Hillary Clinton’s my friend, but she never walked into a union hall.”

Mr. Biden has particularly close ties to Pennsylvania, often jokingly referred to as the “third senator” from the state during his time in Congress, Mr. Nutter said.

“He knows the state. He’s comfortable in the state,” he said. “For him, campaigning in Pennsylvania was almost like going home.”

Shortly after Mrs. Clinton’s loss in 2016, Mr. Biden recalled feeling disturbed when seeing Mr. Trump strike a chord with voters at a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., near his childhood Scranton home.

“Son of a gun — we may lose this election,” Mr. Biden recounted thinking in an interview in December 2016 with The Los Angeles Times.

Mr. Biden crafted his own approach, determined not to repeat what he saw as Mrs. Clinton’s mistakes. Not only did Mr. Biden start and end his campaign in Pennsylvania, he also visited the state more than any other during the campaign. Just a little more than 10 miles from his home in Wilmington, Del., and sharing a common media market, Pennsylvania was a second political home for Mr. Biden long before he started his third presidential bid.

“From the time I started as a U.S. senator, Philadelphia has brought me to the dance!” Mr. Biden, a former senator from Delaware, told cheering supporters in the northern part of the city during his last event before polls closed on Tuesday evening.

Mr. Biden and some of his allies see the working-class and middle-class moderate voters of the Midwest as his natural base, and they tried to build a coalition that was made up of more white voters than the base that elected former President Barack Obama and that Mrs. Clinton tried to replicate in 2016.

“Biden is from a manufacturing town, and he’s of the right age, demographic and financial background,” said Aaron Stearns, the Democratic chairman in Warren County in northwestern Pennsylvania. “People can relate to him in a way that they could not relate to Hillary Clinton.”

Some Democrats say it was Mr. Biden’s willingness to focus on the Northern states, devoting his limited in-person campaign stops to showing up even as coronavirus cases surged across the region, that gave him a chance of winning the states back.

“A lot of the problem was that Hillary Clinton was not here enough in some of the suburban areas that we lost to Trump,” said Jay Costa, the Democratic leader in the Pennsylvania State Senate. “The former vice president did a very good job of not falling into that trap another time.”

In the final days of his campaign, Mr. Biden did add a stop in Ohio, a state that many Democrats believe has shifted — perhaps permanently — away from their party. They were proved right Tuesday night, when Mr. Trump won the state.

Some Democrats attributed the stop in Cleveland to scheduling around events in Pennsylvania. Getting across the country to Arizona would simply take too many precious hours in the final days, given how many stops Mr. Biden’s campaign had planned in the Keystone State.

But others ascribed the visit to Mr. Biden’s dogged belief that the Democratic path to the White House still runs through the Midwest.

The Biden campaign, unlike the campaigns of Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton, did not impose a central strategy on state Democratic parties, said officials in the three states. Instead, the campaign integrated with voter outreach programs that each state had been building since the parties’ losses in 2016.

“The big gamble for state parties was, would the presidential campaign push all the dishes off the table and start over, or integrate with what we had been building?” said Ben Wikler, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. “They didn’t impose a one-size-fits-all model.”

Mr. Wikler said he had been in regular contact with Biden campaign officials beginning last summer to brief them on the program that the state party was building.

After Mrs. Clinton failed to visit Wisconsin during her 2016 campaign, Mr. Biden made three visits to the state, which was set to host the Democratic National Convention before it became an all-virtual event because of the coronavirus pandemic, which is worse in Wisconsin than it is in any other battleground state.

Mr. Wikler said the three visits, along with myriad other virtual events that Mr. Biden and his surrogates hosted for local supporters, were sufficient enough to maintain a presence for Wisconsin voters.

“Biden has made clear all along that Wisconsin is a top priority,” he said.

It may still be some time before the nation knows whether it was enough.

Exit Polls Showed the Vote Came Down to the Pandemic Versus the Economy,"As the country faces a dual national crisis — a monthslong pandemic and economic devastation — voters were deeply divided on what mattered more: containing the coronavirus or hustling to rebuild the economy, according early exit polls and voter surveys released Tuesday.

Their opinion of which was more important fell along starkly partisan lines, with those who viewed the pandemic as the most pressing issue favoring Joseph R. Biden Jr. for president, while those who named the economy and jobs broke overwhelmingly toward re-electing President Trump.

Reflecting a pervasive pessimism, nearly two-thirds of voters said they believed the country was heading in the wrong direction, according to an Associated Press canvass of those who had cast ballots — and those voters overwhelmingly picked Mr. Biden. And while Mr. Trump had attempted to focus the campaign on anything other than the pandemic, it remained a defining issue: More than four in 10 voters said it was the most important problem facing the country, far more than any other issue. 

A separate survey — the traditional exit poll, conducted by Edison Research — asked the question differently; it found that, as important as it was to them, only about one in five voters considered the virus the top issue affecting their vote. More said the economy was, and a similar share said racial inequality decided their ballots.

The overwhelming majority of Trump supporters called the economy excellent or good while an equal share of Biden supporters said it was doing poorly.

Views of the virus also cleaved to politics: Roughly four in five Trump supporters called it at least somewhat under control, while as many Biden voters said it was “not at all under control.”

Those who reported that the pandemic had taken a personal toll tended to back Mr. Biden. More than a third of all voters said they or someone in their household had lost a job or income over the past eight months, and most of those voters favored Mr. Biden.

Those who did not vote in 2016, a group that the Trump campaign said would be key to re-election, appeared to show up in significant numbers — but they mostly turned out to oppose him. First-time voters appeared to favor Mr. Biden by wide margins.

Far fewer said they knew someone who had died from the virus, but among those who did, the vast majority chose the former vice president.

Moderate voters also swung heavily for Mr. Biden, in a tacit rejection of the “radical” label that Mr. Trump had sought to pin on him. Throughout his term, Mr. Trump has alienated moderates with his rhetoric, and was never seen favorably by most independent voters.

It was these voters at the center whom Mr. Biden had most aggressively targeted, using a message of unity and American tradition to offer voters a respite from the bombast of the current president, and to push back against the Trump campaign’s portrayal of the Democrat as a tool of the left.

For the first time, not one but two probability-based, scientifically sound voter surveys were conducted amid the election. The Edison exit polls, conducted on behalf of a consortium of news organizations, were carried out by phone with voters who had cast ballots early, and by in-person interviews at voting places.

The Associated Press also conducted its own voter survey, called VoteCast, using a panel of online respondents assembled by NORC, a research group based at the University of Chicago.

The overall trends in the results were consistent between the two organizations’ surveys, though the exit polls appeared to show Mr. Trump running strongly in more states than the VoteCast survey did. The two polls also asked different questions of their respondents; results from both are referred to in this article.

In contrast to four years ago, a very small share of voters, in the single digits, said they had decided within the past few days, according to the exit polls. Four years ago, 13 percent said they had decided in the final week, according to exit polls.

Pre-election polls throughout this election season had shown that roughly four in five voters held strong opinions on Mr. Trump and his leadership, and strong feelings on both sides continued to define this year’s election. 

Among those voters who cast ballots for him four years ago, about nine in 10 supported him again this time. But Mr. Biden held onto an even stronger share of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 supporters.

Among white voters, there were stark divides along lines of gender as well as education. While Mr. Trump appeared on pace to come close to repeating his blowout win in 2016 among white voters without college degrees, Mr. Biden held a lead among white voters with a college education.

That group was one among many — including suburbanites and political independents — that Mr. Trump had narrowly won when facing Mrs. Clinton, but whose support he had long since lost.

In certain key states, Mr. Biden appeared to fall short of Hillary Clinton’s support four years ago among Latino voters, particularly men. In Florida, the exit poll put his lead in the single digits with Hispanic voters, and in Texas he was barely winning three in five.

But elsewhere his margin among Hispanic voters was much stronger, and nationwide he ran ahead of the president by more than two to one."
"As America Awaits a Winner, Trump Falsely Claims He Prevailed ","With no winner declared in the 2020 presidential race, President Trump appeared in the White House just after 2 a.m. on Wednesday to brazenly claim he had already won the election — and to insist that votes stop being counted even though the ballots of millions of Americans had yet to be tallied. 

Speaking with a mix of defiance, anger and wonder that the election had not yet been called in his favor, the president recounted his standing in an array of battleground states before falsely declaring: “Frankly, we did win this election.” 

No news organizations declared a winner between Mr. Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr., and a number of closely contested states still had millions of mail-in ballots to count, in part because state and local Republican officials had insisted that they not be counted until Election Day. 

Mr. Trump said, without offering any explanation, that “we’ll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court,” and added: “We want all voting to stop.” 

No elected leader has the right to unilaterally order votes to stop being counted, and Mr. Trump’s middle-of-the-night proclamation amounted to a reckless attempt to hijack the electoral process as results in key battleground states were still not final, something without precedent in American politics. 

The president contradicted himself about the vote-counting as he claimed he was gaining strength in Arizona, where votes cast on Election Day were breaking in his favor but where mail-in ballots favored Mr. Biden, the Democratic nominee. Mr. Trump spoke at times from a teleprompter, but he veered off his prepared remarks to make unfounded claims about voting fraud. “We don’t want them to find any more ballots at 4 in the morning,” he said.

The president made his remarks as Mr. Biden was leading in Arizona, a battleground that has been trending more toward Democrats in recent years. If Mr. Biden were to win there, it would be the first state Mr. Trump won in 2016 that flipped to the Democrats this year. 

A short time before Mr. Trump spoke, Mr. Biden adopted a different tone and approach as he addressed supporters in his home state of Delaware. Mr. Biden projected optimism but asked voters for patience. He pointed to Pennsylvania and Michigan, among other battlegrounds, as slow-counting states that he expected to win.

“As I’ve said all along, it’s not my place or Donald Trump’s place to declare who’s won this election,” Mr. Biden said. “That’s the decision of the American people. But I’m optimistic about this outcome.”

Mr. Biden added: “It ain’t over till every vote is counted.”

His campaign manager, Jen O’Malley Dillon, issued a statement on Wednesday morning condemning Mr. Trump’s remarks. “The president’s statement tonight about trying to shut down the counting of duly cast ballots was outrageous, unprecedented and incorrect,” she said, adding, “It will not happen.” 

“If the president makes good on his threat to go to court to try to prevent the proper tabulation of votes,’’ she said, “we have legal teams standing by ready to deploy to resist that effort. And they will prevail.’’

Mr. Trump’s remarks added another bizarre twist to one of the most extraordinary election cycles in the nation’s history. For weeks leading up to Election Day, and in voting across the country on Tuesday, Americans overcame their fears of the coronavirus, long lines at the polls and the vexing challenges of a transformed voting system to bring the campaign to a conclusion, with the fate of Mr. Trump’s tumultuous White House reign hanging in the balance.

Voter enthusiasm never waned. Turnout was expected to break the record of 139 million votes set in 2016, and the percentage of eligible Americans who voted might be the highest in more than a century. More than 100 million early votes had already been cast before Election Day, a record.

As of early Wednesday morning, the race remained shrouded in uncertainty, as Mr. Biden failed to achieve any early breakthroughs, and as Mr. Trump clung to a lead in a number of Southern states that Democrats had hoped to flip into their column. 

Mr. Trump dashed Democrats’ hopes of picking up both Florida and Ohio, two swing states that have tilted to the right in recent years, and that Mr. Trump carried four years ago. He also turned back a challenge from Mr. Biden in Iowa, a smaller state where Mr. Biden made a late effort to pick up its six Electoral College votes.

Mr. Trump did not have a clear upper hand, but the prolonged suspense was, at least at the start, something of a victory for the president, who was at risk of being eliminated from contention if one of the big, historically Republican states of the Southeast had defected to Mr. Biden. That was still a possibility in North Carolina or Georgia, where the vote tally was closely divided.

In Georgia, there appeared to be a large number of uncounted ballots in the Atlanta metro area, and those votes were expected to tilt solidly to Mr. Biden. And in a number of the state’s rural counties, Mr. Biden was slightly outperforming the margins posted by Stacey Abrams, a Democrat who lost a race for governor there two years ago by about 55,000 votes.

Vote-counting was moving relatively slowly in some battleground states on Tuesday night because of the scale of the turnout, a backlog of absentee ballots received by mail and scattered problems with processing the vote. And each state handled the counting and releasing of its ballots differently. 

Ohio, for example, released the results of all of its mail ballots after the polls closed — making the state seem to tilt toward Mr. Biden until more Election Day votes were cast. Similarly, Michigan released its day-of votes in the first hours after polls closed, making it seem that Mr. Trump enjoyed a wide advantage in a hotly contested state.

Much of the uncertainty hanging over the election arose from the inconsistent or patchwork array of state-level policies hurriedly put in place to enable voting amid a public health disaster. In a number of states, like Pennsylvania and Michigan, local Republican officials blocked Democrats’ efforts to make it easier to count ballots cast before Election Day, raising the possibility of a drawn-out count in some of the most important battlegrounds — the very occurrence Mr. Trump protested Wednesday morning.

Democrats feared that in some cases a Supreme Court now dominated by conservative justices could ultimately limit vote-counting in a way that would aid Mr. Trump, a possibility the president raised in his remarks.

For all the angst about a potential breakdown in voting procedures in advance of Election Day, there were no prominent reports of technological failures or chaos at the polls, nor was there any evidence of significant civil unrest midway through the evening. There was still the potential for considerable uncertainty in the slower-counting states, but none of the numerous doomsday scenarios on the logistics of voting seemed to come to pass.

Mr. Biden, the former vice president, was outperforming Hillary Clinton in a number of the country’s large metropolitan areas, but Mr. Trump was reprising or enlarging his margins in many rural areas. With far less support going to third-party candidates this year, Mr. Biden was effectively picking up many of those votes in urban areas while Mr. Trump was adding them to his margins in less populated areas.

In the battle for the Senate, Democrats gained a seat they were widely expected to win in Colorado, as former Gov. John Hickenlooper defeated Senator Cory Gardner, a first-term Republican. But Republicans made up for that setback in Alabama, where Senator Doug Jones, a Democrat elected in a 2017 special election, lost the seat to Tommy Tuberville, the former football coach.

While it was too early to say which party would control the chamber in January, Democrats faced disappointment in three solidly red states where they were making a bid to stretch the campaign map. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, easily defeated Jaime Harrison; Representative Roger Marshall of Kansas defended an open seat that Democrats had contested aggressively; and Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa turned back a challenge from Theresa Greenfield. 



The absence of a decisive shift toward Mr. Biden in the conservative-leaning states that reported their votes earliest raised the prospect of a drawn-out wait for clarity in the Northern battlegrounds, where both parties expected him to run stronger. 

In several of the largest swing states on the map, including Michigan and Pennsylvania, local officials were strictly limited in their ability to process ballots cast before Election Day, making it unlikely that they would be called for either candidate by the end of Tuesday night.

Still, the possibility of a romping victory by Mr. Biden appeared far slimmer than it did going into Election Day, based on a mountain of public polling data that showed him to be a clear front-runner across virtually the entire map.

Mr. Biden, 77, appeared to be underperforming with Latino voters, especially in the critical battleground of Florida, where he led Mr. Trump by only single digits in the group, according to exit polls. Mrs. Clinton won Latinos in the state by a wider margin four years ago; Mr. Trump’s improvement appeared to reflect the success of his insistent anti-socialist message in South Florida, where Cuban-Americans and other immigrant communities are wary of far-left policies.



As states began to be called there were no early surprises. Mr. Biden picked up states throughout the Northeast as well as Virginia and Illinois, and the reliable Democratic prizes of New York and California, according to The Associated Press. Mr. Trump won in parts of the South, as well as conservative-leaning Indiana and West Virginia and states in the Northern Plains. 

Mr. Biden carried New Hampshire, a small state Mrs. Clinton won by a tiny margin four years ago. Mr. Trump had tried to seize the mercurial Northeastern state this time, but fell well short of doing so.

The onset of the coronavirus pandemic in the winter recast the election as a referendum on Mr. Trump’s leadership in a crisis, restricted the activities of candidates up and down the ballot and upended the voting habits of tens of millions of Americans.

To the end, Mr. Trump insisted that the pandemic was quickly dissipating, despite mountains of evidence that the virus was spreading more rapidly than ever throughout the country. He blamed Democrats and the news media for overhyping the threat from the virus, and never formulated a factual rebuttal to Mr. Biden’s charge that his passivity and ineptitude had led to thousands of needless deaths.

Mr. Trump campaigned vigorously across battleground states in the final days, hoping that a robust turnout from late-voting Republicans and rural white people would help him overcome the advantages Mr. Biden had built across a diverse coalition, especially with white suburban women.

Mr. Biden, who held a steady lead in the polls throughout the general election, maintained a more modest pace with smaller gatherings that showcased his emphasis on public safety in a health crisis. He spent the final days of the race denouncing Mr. Trump’s failure to control the pandemic and his public attacks on scientists in his own administration.

Mr. Biden’s candidacy also had the potential to create a history-making moment for his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, who is of Indian and Jamaican descent; she was seeking to become the first woman on a winning presidential ticket. And Mr. Biden would be only the second Catholic president, along with John F. Kennedy. 

According to recent polls, Mr. Biden appeared to have succeeded in making himself a kind of safe harbor for a wide array of voters unhappy with Mr. Trump, including women, white voters with college degrees, people of color, young people and older adults. But Mr. Biden’s coalition was more impressive for its breadth than its depth, and despite its size and diversity, most voters supporting him appeared more excited to reject Mr. Trump than to install Mr. Biden in his place. 

Mr. Trump, by contrast, was relying on a far narrower base of support: rural and less educated white voters, and especially men, who continued to embrace his message of hard-edge nationalism and cultural grievance even as the economic downturn deprived Mr. Trump of the chance to campaign on several years of comfortable growth.



Even aside from the pandemic, the 2020 campaign unfolded against a backdrop of national tumult unequaled in recent history, including the House’s vote to impeach the president less than a year ago, a remarkable wave of racial justice protests in the spring, spasms of civil unrest throughout the summer, the death of a Supreme Court justice in September, and the hospitalization of the president in October.

As a result, Election Day arrived with the nation on edge, confused in some places about new voting systems and court battles over the electoral process, and worried about flare-ups of violence in the aftermath of a disputed result. 

Mr. Trump, 74, encouraged those fears, and the underlying social divisions that fostered them: On the eve of the election, he made a baseless claim that a court decision on Pennsylvania’s ballot-counting procedures would lead to street violence. No American presidential race in half a century or more has featured the same scale of civil unrest and uncertainty about the legitimacy of the political process, and no modern campaign has been so defined by an incumbent president who seemed to relish both factors the way Mr. Trump has.





Recent opinion surveys found that Mr. Biden had a strong advantage among people who had already voted. For Mr. Trump, catching up would depend on turning out voters in large numbers on Election Day and winning them by a sizable margin.

The race was the most expensive presidential campaign ever, and Mr. Trump’s much-lauded messaging apparatus was quickly eclipsed by a behemoth Biden operation that caught and far surpassed the Trump campaign in fund-raising. In the final month of the campaign, Mr. Biden’s spending surged, giving him a more than two-to-one advantage on the airwaves and online, according to Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm.

Democrats Battle for Senate Control as They Maintain Grip on House Majority,"Democrats were on track early Wednesday to maintain a firm grip on the House, but their path to seizing the Senate majority from Republicans was rapidly narrowing as the two parties continued to fight for control of the levers of power in Congress with the fate of the presidency still uncertain.

Partial results suggested that House Democrats were running strong in many of the competitive districts they swept up in 2018, but they were struggling to make further inroads into the Republican-leaning suburbs, where they had expected a surge powered by discontent with President Trump. Instead, as votes continued to be counted, Republicans were newly optimistic they could claw back seats, particularly in rural areas and traditionally conservative strongholds in places like Oklahoma City and Staten Island.

The Senate outcome rested on a handful of states where Democrats still hoped to topple incumbent Republicans, but their pickup opportunities were dwindling fast on an unusually large battleground that stretched from Maine to Alaska and could tilt with the presidential results. At stake was the ability of the next president to fill his cabinet, appoint judges and pursue his agenda, and the two parties had waged a pitched battle to the end, pummeling voters with advertising backed by record sums of money, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars.

Republicans scored crucial wins in Iowa, Alabama and Montana, and were running stronger than expected in North Carolina and Maine, where the results were still too close to call early Wednesday morning.

Democrats needed a net gain of three or four seats to take Senate control, depending on whether former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee, won the presidency, which would allow his vice president, Kamala Harris, to cast tiebreaking votes.

They flipped seats in Colorado, where John Hickenlooper, the former Democratic governor, easily defeated Senator Cory Gardner, and in Arizona, where Mark Kelly, a former astronaut, beat Senator Martha McSally.

But Tommy Tuberville, the former Auburn football coach, easily won back deep-red Alabama from Senator Doug Jones. In Iowa, the victory by Senator Joni Ernst over Theresa Greenfield, a Democrat with roots in the state’s farming community, scuttled Democrats’ hopes for a key pickup. And in Montana, Steve Daines beat back a challenge from the state’s popular Democratic governor, Steve Bullock.

That left both sides closely watching Maine, North Carolina and Georgia, where partial returns showed exceedingly tight races between Republican incumbents and their Democratic challengers.

Earlier, Republicans had breathed a sigh of relief when Senator John Cornyn was declared the winner in Texas, despite a record turnout, and again when Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of Mr. Trump’s, won re-election in South Carolina after a tougher-than-expected race. In Kentucky, Senator Mitch McConnell, the top Republican, secured a seventh term, though it was unclear whether he would remain majority leader.

“Tonight, Kentuckians said, ‘We’re not finished yet,’” Mr. McConnell told supporters in Louisville. “Kentucky wants more of the policies that built the best economy in our nation’s modern history — not socialism.”

At least one Senate race taking place in Georgia, an unexpectedly competitive battleground this year, was headed for a winner-takes-all January runoff that could decide the balance of the Senate only weeks before Inauguration Day if Tuesday’s contests did not. The state’s other race could also end up in a runoff, but it was too early to be certain.

In the fight for the House, Democrats began the night more clearly on the offensive, bolstered by a stunning fund-raising advantage, Republican recruitment failures and Mr. Trump’s eroding support in America’s cities and suburbs. Two years after gaining 41 seats to reclaim the majority, Democrats were trying to push into suburban districts that Republicans had not lost in decades around St. Louis, Indianapolis, Atlanta, Phoenix, Omaha and even once ruby-red parts of Texas.

But while strategists in both parties had said a second blue wave could wash out 10 to 20 Republicans, by Wednesday morning, returns indicated that no such sweep had materialized. A handful of Republican incumbents in newly competitive suburban districts held onto their seats, and some Democrats who had been confident of victories were vanquished, including first-term Representative Joe Cunningham, who was defeated by Nancy Mace, the first woman to graduate from the Citadel, in his Charleston-based district.

At the same time, Democrats fell short of snatching victories in solidly red districts that the party had hoped to make competitive, and lost more ground in the increasingly conservative rural Midwest, with the defeat of Representative Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee who served three decades in Congress.

“We have held the House and now, when — after all the votes are counted, we’ll see how much better we will do than that,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday night. But she also tried to play down Democrats’ lackluster performance.

“It’s not just about the quantity,” she added. “It’s about the quality of leadership that they provide for our country.”

Republicans began the cycle hoping to grab onto Mr. Trump’s coattails and a booming economy to wrest back the 30 or so districts he won in 2016 that Democrats claimed two years later. But those hopes were dashed by the pandemic, which has left the economy in tatters and the nation counting more than 230,000 deaths to date.

Still, they found some unexpected bright spots on Tuesday night. With Mr. Trump making significant inroads among Cuban-Americans in Miami, Representative Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a first-term Democrat, was edged out by Carlos Gimenez, the Miami mayor, and Representative Donna E. Shalala lost to Maria Elvira Salazar, a former television anchor.

Republican veterans Ann Wagner of Missouri, Steve Chabot of Ohio and Rodney Davis of Illinois also held off stiff challenges, and Republicans were on track for better-than-expected result in a handful of Texas House races where Democrats saw pickup opportunities.

The battle for the Senate was being waged on even friendlier turf for Republicans. Though they were defending 23 states, compared with just 12 for Democrats, almost all of them were places that Mr. Trump carried in 2016 — creating a real possibility that voters could render a split decision on Tuesday, dividing power between the White House and Senate.

For the second election season in a row, Democrats ran with an almost singular focus on health care, blistering Republicans for their campaign to overturn the Affordable Care Act. The law, and its protections of pre-existing conditions, took on further resonance in the face of a public health crisis unlike any the nation has seen in generations and the confirmation just a week before Election Day of a Supreme Court justice, Amy Coney Barrett, who Democrats argued would strike down the law.

In race after race, Republicans’ chances appeared to hinge on the unexpected strength of Mr. Trump, a polarizing leader who has enraptured their core supporters even as his inflammatory style and unorthodox policy positions have frustrated them and alienated crucial voting blocs. A few Republicans, like Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who was battling for political survival in the race of her career, were willing to wag their fingers at the president, but most knew they could not risk his ire, or the support of his loyal base, if they were to have any shot at re-election.

Worried about Mr. Trump’s chances, though, many Republicans closed their campaigns with warnings to voters of the risks posed by putting the White House and Congress under full Democratic control.

In North Carolina, Cal Cunningham, a telegenic Iraq war veteran who led for much of the year, was at grave risk of falling short in his effort to oust Republican Senator Thom Tillis. Mr. Tillis had a lead of nearly 100,000 votes early Wednesday, but North Carolina accepts postmarked mail-in ballots until Nov. 12, making a final call premature.

The race in Maine has been just as steady, with the Democrat, Sara Gideon, the speaker of the State Legislature, threatening to unseat Ms. Collins, a four-term Republican and one of the last centrists left in her party. After easily winning re-election in 2014, Ms. Collins struggled to stay afloat as her race became a national referendum on the Republican Party, and she was battling to win a majority to avoid activating the state’s newly enacted ranked-choice voting system, which could badly hurt her chances.

“We’ve never given up because that is what we Mainers do — we work hard, we show up for work every day and we get the job done,” Ms. Collins told her supporters, addressing them in a snowy parking lot in Bangor. “I wish that I could thank each of you by name, that would take all night — on the other hand, we may be here all night.”

Democrats remained hopeful about two races in Georgia, where Jon Ossoff, a 33-year-old documentary filmmaker, had mounted a strong challenge to Senator David Perdue, and the Rev. Dr. Raphael Warnock was challenging Senator Kelly Loeffler in a special election to replace the retired Republican senator Johnny Isakson. With multiple Democratic and Republican candidates splitting the vote, Ms. Loeffler was headed to a runoff with Dr. Warnock, after Republican Representative Doug Collins conceded. Mr. Ossoff and Mr. Perdue could end up in a runoff, too, but were both still jockeying to clear the 50 percent required under Georgia law to win outright.

Mr. McConnell, 78, handily beat back a challenge from Amy McGrath, a former fighter pilot. Democrats poured $100 million into the contest, but Ms. McGrath never commanded the kind of support in the solidly Republican state to make the incumbent nervous.

Both parties had other targets, but they were considered stretches. For Republicans, the best option was Michigan, where John James, a Black Iraq war veteran who ran for the Senate unsuccessfully in 2018, was trying to unseat Senator Gary Peters. Democrats believed they had an outside shot of defeating Dan Sullivan in Alaska.

The outcome of the Senate contest promised to heavily shape the next two years in Washington. If Democrats were able to grab control of the House, Senate and White House at once for the first time since 2010, they could abolish the legislative filibuster — the last major vestige of minority rights in the Senate — and push through an ambitious slate of bills on voting rights, gun safety, policing and prescription drug prices. They would most likely reserve much of their political capital for expanding the Affordable Care Act and raising taxes on the wealthy to offset that and other new programs.

Nodding to the possibility of all-Democratic control, Mr. McConnell warned during his victory speech: “This is no time to declare war on our institutions because one side is angry that the framers made it hard to achieve radical change.”

But Democrats feared that even if Mr. Biden were to win, they could fall short in the Senate, saddling the incoming president with a Republican majority ready to oppose him on nearly every front, dashing liberal hopes and swiping his agenda off the table. Facing a Senate led by Mr. McConnell, Mr. Biden could even have an uphill battle winning its approval to fill his cabinet, and he would certainly face opposition to liberal nominees to the federal courts.

Similarly, if Mr. Trump were re-elected and Democrats controlled both the House and Senate, his second term could be a frustrating exercise in stalemate.

"At the End of a Chaotic Campaign, an Election Day That Defied the Worst Fears","The worst fears about a chaotic end to a chaotic campaign failed to materialize on Tuesday as the final day of voting went off with little more than sporadic glitches and confrontations even as the tension over the outcome and aftermath remained undiminished.

The most litigated, disrupted and polarized election in generations came to a close with voters who had not already cast their ballots by mail or in person during early voting trooping to the polls on an Election Day redefined by the coronavirus pandemic.

There were scattered problems and hints of battles still to be fought: The authorities in Michigan sought to hunt down the source of robocalls that warned voters to “stay home.” A federal judge ordered the Postal Service to make an intensive sweep for mail-in ballots that had yet to be delivered. And legal skirmishes broke out in and around Philadelphia as Republicans sought to challenge votes in the critical Democratic stronghold.

With a record number of votes already having been cast, election officials across the country reported relatively smooth operations on Tuesday, with nothing more than the usual long lines at polling places — made longer by social distancing — and machine malfunctions.

The scale of the turnout and the shift to mail voting led to slow counts in some major cities in battleground states. In Philadelphia, about 20 percent of the absentee ballots had been counted by 9 p.m. In Milwaukee, election officials said they would not be done until 5 a.m. on Wednesday at the earliest.

Appearing after midnight in Wilmington, Del., Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee, called for patience as the count proceeded in the states where the outcome is likely to be determined, including Pennsylvania.

“It ain’t over till every vote is counted, every ballot is counted,” Mr. Biden said.

Early on Wednesday, President Trump said on Twitter, “We are up BIG,” and claimed without evidence that Democrats “are trying to steal the election,” an assertion that led Twitter to say his post was “disputed and may be misleading.”

But while the process of determining the winner could well prove to be as contentious as Mr. Trump has threatened to make it, much of what experts had feared might happen on a most unusual Election Day did not come to pass.

In the past several days and weeks, foreign countries interfered less than they had leading up to the 2018 midterm elections, the director of the National Security Agency, Gen. Paul M. Nakasone, told reporters on Tuesday. And although there were reports of Russian trolls trying to amplify debunked claims of election fraud, they were limited in scope and there was no evidence of either widespread hacking or rampant Election Day disinformation efforts.

Fears of violence that led some shopkeepers and homeowners to board up their windows and doors had not been realized as of early Tuesday evening, and there were only scattered and limited reports of intimidation at voting precincts.

By the end of a day that was expected to push the percentage of Americans voting to its highest level since 1908, with a predicted total of around 160 million votes, it had become clear that the nation’s creaky elections infrastructure was proving to be more resilient than either the Republicans or Democrats had expected.

“We have not seen major systemic problems or attempts to obstruct voting,” said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which runs the Election Protection Hotline, adding that problems had been “isolated and sporadic.”

Conducted over weeks in which coronavirus infections reached new highs nationwide and with Mr. Trump aggressively seeking to cast doubt on the integrity of the voting system, the election posed challenges that both voters and the officials running it largely adapted to meet.

Television images showed election workers in downtown Philadelphia making quick work of opening and counting stacks of mail ballots. Voters met long lines in Detroit with high spirits, and no major reports of unrest.

Even in Georgia, which became a symbol for all of the challenges of the nation’s election infrastructure when its new voting system experienced a wholesale breakdown in the spring, officials reported generally “steady movement” at polling stations, despite reports of some nagging issues with malfunctioning voting machines.

“It has been steady as she goes throughout the state,” Gabriel Sterling, an official at the Georgia secretary of state’s office, told a group of reporters in midafternoon on Tuesday. Waiting times around the state, he said, averaged two minutes.

Across Omaha, lines at polling places were shorter than in past days. Lined up were people like Ann Roth, 57, a voter who said God told her that the president was going to win, and Happy Sadjo, 47, who immigrated from the West African nation of Togo and called Mr. Trump an “American dictator.”

In polling locations across northern Philadelphia — a Democratic stronghold of the type that Mr. Biden is counting on to give him an edge in a vital battleground state — voters lined up as early as 6 a.m., an hour before the polls opened.

“I think Philadelphia is ready for a change, and they’re going to turn out,” said Sonia Bacchus, who arrived at William Rowen Elementary School early and came equipped with a folding chair for the lines. “Oh yeah.”

The vast expansion of early voting options could reveal a vastly different electorate: Of the 100 million voters who cast early ballots, nearly 30 percent did not vote in 2016, according to TargetSmart, a Democratic data firm.

But arduous work lay ahead with the counting of the record volume of mail-in ballots, especially in states like Pennsylvania that do not start counting absentee ballots until Election Day and are likely to take days to complete the task.

Democrats were keeping a particularly wary eye on the Postal Service, which reported that its processing system had not recorded the delivery to elections offices of some 300,000 ballots — and that mail slowdowns were particularly having adverse effects in Democratic party strongholds like Philadelphia, Detroit, Atlanta and South Florida.

Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the Federal District Court in Washington, D.C., ordered sweeps in trouble spots on Tuesday to ensure that all ballots are found and delivered. The Postal Service said it was working into the evening to try to meet the court’s demands, though on its own time frame.

The entire voting process still faced the constant and continuing threat of litigation. Over the course of the election, more than 400 election-related lawsuits were filed across the country, and courts were still issuing major rulings as voting was getting underway. A federal appeals court in Texas rejected a Republican appeal to try and knock out more than 127,000 votes that had been cast at drive-through voting locations in Harris County.

Over the course of the day, Republicans accelerated their legal challenges in Pennsylvania, which both campaigns view as the likely epicenter of any legal fight over the ultimate result.

As Republicans ratcheted up criticism of senior Democratic officials overseeing voting in the state, Republican candidates and activists filed suits in federal and state courts seeking to disqualify the votes of Pennsylvanians who were given an opportunity to fix problematic mail-in ballots that had already been received, or to file replacement, provisional ballots. Judges agreed to hear those cases on Wednesday.

The Trump campaign also complained that election officials in Philadelphia were keeping the campaign’s observers too far from counting tables. The observers were there to observe the process as absentee ballots were processed and counted for potential challenges, but the campaign had yet to file suit as of late afternoon.

In Nevada, the Trump campaign filed an emergency motion on Tuesday afternoon, asking the Nevada Supreme Court to halt the processing of some mail-in ballots in Clark County until local election officials allow for expanded access to observe the processing of mail ballots. The court denied the motion on Tuesday evening.

Later, the Trump campaign successfully filed an emergency suit to extend poll hours in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, by one hour.

The efforts were part of Mr. Trump’s longstanding drive to raise doubts about the integrity of the entire voting system and give himself grounds to challenge any unfavorable outcome or lengthy counting process by claiming fraud.

Though it threatened to undermine confidence in the final results, it also thrust voting rights to the center of the national political debate in a way not seen since the civil rights era, driving Democratic turnout, Biden campaign aides said.

Election officials from both parties tended to agree, determining that all the questions about voting this year forced Americans to vote earlier, spreading the strain on the system across weeks and avoiding a single, last-minute crush.

“Voters really thought about how they were going to vote months ago, and many had a plan and have executed on that,” said Kim Wyman, a Republican and the secretary of state in Washington, who oversees one of five predominantly vote-by-mail systems in the country and became an adviser to her colleagues in other states this year. “That’s exciting that we had that kind of engagement.”

Still, the president’s attacks on the voting system also created an unusual situation in which his own supporters indicated to pollsters that they were less likely to vote by mail than their Democratic counterparts were, creating a bipartisan expectation that the president would lead the in-person, election-day vote and trail in the mail ballots.

That divide on the degree of the threat from the pandemic was visible on Election Day. At a polling location in Dallas, an election judge refused to wear a mask inside, bringing complaints from voters throughout the day.

At an afternoon news briefing with reporters during a visit to his Virginia campaign headquarters, the president renewed his complaint that the Supreme Court did not step in to block Pennsylvania’s decision to count all ballots with postmarks on or before Election Day that arrive at elections offices up to three days afterward.

Several states are similarly planning to count late-arriving ballots, meaning that if the outcome is close, it may be days before the winner is known for sure.

On Monday night, Twitter had flagged a post by Mr. Trump that predicted violence in response to the Supreme Court decision allowing Pennsylvania, for now, to stick to its extended counting deadline.

And on Tuesday, it highlighted a statement by the Philadelphia District Attorney’s office debunking a claim amplified by Mr. Trump’s aides and supporters that Democrats had illegally hung a poster promoting the Biden ticket at a downtown polling station.

“Misinformation being spread online has driven more calls to the Election Task Force hotline,” said Jane Roh, a spokeswoman for the Philadelphia district attorney, “than actual incidents at polling sites.”

"As Counting Begins, a Flood of Mail Ballots Complicates Vote Tallies","[President-elect Joe Biden’s victory prompts spontaneous celebrations.]

Voters returned nearly 64 million mail-in ballots before Election Day, a pandemic-driven record that is certain to make for a more complicated vote count this year but could also reshape American elections for years to come.

The counting is underway, but there are major differences among battleground states in how that plays out, and potential legal challenges — particularly from the Trump campaign — are likely to further complicate the process.

Some battleground states, like North Carolina, have been processing ballots for weeks. Elections officials there expect at least 97 percent of votes to be counted on Tuesday night. But in one of the most hotly contested states, Pennsylvania, the Trump campaign and Republican allies blocked counties from processing votes ahead of the election.

Mail-in balloting this year doubled from 2016, and for many voters, the shift has been a revelation.

In Atlanta, Frank Casaceli ran up the stairs of a library on the Georgia State University campus on Sunday, placed his absentee ballot in an official county drop box, and quickly headed back to his parked car. At age 42, it was the first time he had ever voted.

“Usually I work 12 hours a day,” Mr. Casaceli said, explaining why he had skipped out on the polls for the past two decades. The convenience factor, driving to the drop box on a traffic-free Sunday afternoon and skipping the lines at polls, had removed a major impediment to his participation.

Mr. Casaceli voted for President Trump, who has spent much of the 2020 campaign admonishing people like him, who cast their mail-in ballots in the closing days of the election. Mr. Trump returned to the issue on Monday at a rally in Fayetteville, N.C.

“Get your ballots in and have them in long before the third, and have them counted before the third,” he said, while assailing a recent Supreme Court ruling that rebuffed his campaign’s attempt to curtail the acceptance of Pennsylvania ballots that are postmarked by Election Day but arrive in election offices up to three days later.

“What a ruling, what a horrible thing that they’ve done,” he said of the court. “Do you know that puts our country in danger? Do you know what can happen during that long period of time?” he said, and then, answering his own question, said “cheating can happen like you’ve never seen.”

The president’s persistent claims of a rigged election, however, are baseless. But with more Democrats voting by mail than Republicans, Mr. Trump has tried to sow doubts about the process and the validity of those ballots.

“I don’t care how hard Donald Trump tries, there’s nothing, nothing he can do to stop the people of this nation from voting, no matter how he tries,” former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said at a rally in Pittsburgh. “Trump doesn’t want y’all voting. He doesn’t want Americans voting. He thinks only wealthy folks should vote. And when America votes, though, America will be heard.”

Five states were already largely voting by mail in the years before the pandemic: Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Hawaii and Utah. Now the rest of the country appears to be moving in that direction as well, notwithstanding the president’s stance, concerns that absentee votes have a higher rejection rate than in-person votes, or stories of ballots that were never delivered or went astray. (Absentee and mail-in votes are largely interchangeable terms.)

“I believe the usage of mail balloting in this election will continue a trend towards expanded mail balloting that we’ve seen across the country. In particular, states with permanent absentee ballot lists will likely see their numbers swell, which may eventually lead the way to all-mail ballot elections,” said Michael McDonald, a professor of political science at the University of Florida.

This year’s mail-in vote totals will climb well past the nearly 64 million that election officials had recorded through Monday. Some ballots have already arrived at election offices around the country but have not yet been entered into the system. Others have been mailed, but not yet delivered.

Dr. McDonald, who tracks election statistics, says that, as of Tuesday, just over 28 million absentee ballots requested by voters had not been entered as returned to election officials. In an analysis posted on his website, he said that those ballots are rightly a concern to Democrats, but that there still may be time for many of them to be counted.

While many states require that ballots arrive at elections offices by the close of polls Tuesday, some permit extra time, as long as the ballots are postmarked by Election Day.

About 15 election workers in Fulton County, home to Atlanta, were busy Monday processing ballots in a large room at the State Farm Arena — space lent to the county by the Atlanta Hawks basketball team.

Huddled around white plastic Postal Service trays containing tens of thousands of ballots, the workers were methodically opening them, placing ballots and envelopes in separate stacks, then scanning the ballots into machines resembling large printers.

While the scanning is ongoing, the actual vote tallying will not take place until after polls close, but having the ballots already scanned is a significant advantage.

By contrast, Republicans who control the Pennsylvania Legislature thwarted efforts by county leaders and the governor to begin processing mail-in ballots there, which as a result did not begin until Election Day.

“The legislature has refused to give counties the time they need,” said Amber McReynolds, chief executive of the National Vote at Home Institute, which advocates voting by mail, and the former head of Denver’s election system. “When the president started tweeting about vote by mail, we pretty much lost all the momentum we had with legislatures in certain states. I really wish we hadn’t had the tweeting.”

Mr. Trump originally voiced concern in March, during an appearance on “Fox & Friends,” that Republicans would never be elected again if coronavirus-related voting changes championed by Democrats were enacted. Those concerns could have been the underlying reason for his subsequent repeated claims that voting by mail was vulnerable to mischief. By July, Mr. Trump was claiming that it would lead to large-scale election fraud.

Some Republicans worried that the president’s assault on mail voting had undermined efforts at both the party’s national and state levels to encourage its voters to apply for absentee ballots.

After all, it was Republicans who had pioneered a strategy during the 1980s of promoting absentee voting, focusing on Floridians who escaped to milder climates during the summer.

One advantage of the mail voting process is its convenience for people whose work schedules are busy or inflexible. Frequently they are lower-paid workers whose votes skew Democratic.

Democrats have embraced mail-in ballots in this election at a far higher rate than Republicans, according to numbers from states that report the party registration of voters.

In the battleground state of Florida, a major prize with 29 electoral votes, 2.1 million Democrats have returned mail ballots compared to 1.4 million Republicans. (Republicans in Florida lead, however, in early, in-person voting, a separate category of early voting.)

Despite the convenience of mail voting, and the possibility that it is partly responsible for turnout increases this year, it has downsides. In every election there are votes that go uncounted because of machine malfunctions or other snafus. Research shows that those votes, known as the “undercount,” are higher when mail ballots are used.

Part of the undercount this year — a yet-undetermined number — is made up of those voters who applied for absentee ballots but did not receive them.

A Gwinnett County, Ga., man, Patrick Boyle, had planned to cast a vote for Mr. Biden. But Mr. Boyle, who is working temporarily in the wine industry in Oregon, received his Georgia ballot on Saturday — too late to use it — even though he requested it more than a month ago.

A postal worker came to his door and delivered the ballot in a good-sized box, first requesting to see his identification.

“Everything about it was confusing,” said Mr. Boyle, 27. “The return address is some warehouse in Detroit.”

Mr. Boyle’s partner, who had requested a ballot from Fulton County, Ga., in September, never got hers at all, he said.

Amid Mr. Trump’s criticism of mail-in voting, he himself cast an absentee ballot this year, as he has in the past — and as have some of his supporters.

Rose Bryant, a 68-year-old retiree who attended Mr. Trump’s rally Monday in Fayetteville, said “I don’t like it” when asked about the move to broader mail-in voting, even though she and her husband have cast absentee ballots in the past. “This is how Democrats find a way to cheat.”"

After months of anticipation, supporters gathered to watch the results roll in on Tuesday evening. 

After a record number of voters cast their ballots early or by mail this election, officials worked late into the evening counting votes after polls closed on Election Day. Legal challenges to the vote count are expected.

In spite of a surging pandemic, an economic downturn and a caustic presidential campaign, voters brought enthusiasm to the polls. Some were able to find moments of joy on Election Day.

Americans packed into voting booths across the country to cast the remaining ballots of the election season on Tuesday. The early vote alone accounts for more than 70 percent of the turnout from the 2016 election. Follow our live election updates here.

Single-use pens, outdoor locations and plenty of sanitizing spray are just some of the hallmarks of voting during the coronavirus pandemic. Polling places have had to make adjustments to prevent spread of the virus, which is climbing to new heights in the United States. Follow our live coronavirus updates here.

The campaign isn’t over until polls are closed. Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden made final visits to supporters on Tuesday. Around the country, candidates for local and national office made their final pitch to voters. See how Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden spent the rest of 2020.

The pandemic threatened to upend the country’s election infrastructure, which is primarily run by older Americans who serve as clerks and poll workers. This age group is most likely to suffer the worst effects of the coronavirus. Many states recruited a younger generation of poll workers. 

Long lines at polling places have been a persistent sight in 2020. During primaries and early voting, some reported waiting many hours to cast ballots. Lines remained on Election Day as the final group of voters surged to the polls.

Voting in person on Election Day still held a certain appeal for the people lining up early Tuesday — whether because it had become tradition or because they just could not sleep. Read more about the voters who arrived before dawn and other live election updates here.

The coronavirus pandemic has made finding an alternative to in-person activities essential. Voting was no exception. Many states expanded access to absentee voting and have since seen record numbers of ballots requested. This influx, however, is setting up for a protracted vote count as some states were not allowed to begin opening or counting the ballots until Tuesday. 

Election Day is always the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, but the day circled on the calendar every four years is no longer the singular time when American elections happen.

This year, millions of Americans voted as soon as they could. They sent ballots back in the mail, deposited them into drop boxes, handed them off to municipal clerks or county elections boards, or went to early voting centers. — REID J. EPSTEIN

Biden Says Trump Is ‘Not Who We Are.’ Do Voters Agree?,"From the start of his 2020 campaign, Joseph R. Biden Jr. insisted that President Trump was an aberration, his norm-breaking, race-baiting tenure anathema to the national character.

“It’s not who we are,” Mr. Biden often said, “not what America is.”

And at the end of the 2020 campaign, an anxious, quarrelsome country seemed to be turning a question back at him: Are you sure?

For millions of Trump supporters, the last four years have been a time when things changed for the better, when they felt they had a president who knew exactly who they were. They cheered pre-virus jobs success, shifts in the tax code, trade fights with China and the emerging rightward tilt of the Supreme Court. But they often responded more viscerally to the fury than the finer points: Mr. Trump’s eager brawls against elites and institutions, against threats to conservatives’ preferred social order, against shared enemies.

For many Democrats, the story of this White House is far uglier: division for its own sake and for Mr. Trump’s personal aggrandizement, coaxing an American backslide that harnessed the levers of government to settle scores and buoy white supremacists, international strongmen and anyone else who spoke well of the man in charge.

On Tuesday, this abiding conflict — over which vision of America will endure, over whether this president is more protector or destroyer — was put to the voters at last.

Early returns produced no winner but affirmed the persistence of national fissures, as Democrats who had indulged in fantasies about the catharsis of instant victory were left once more to wonder if they understood America as well as they had assumed.

But even before any final verdict was to be rendered, this election season had already supplied some answers to the question of who we are — evidence of all that Mr. Trump has changed, and all that he hasn’t, and all the work that will await Mr. Biden if his bet is rewarded.

America is now a nation where businesses in many cities boarded up their windows in anticipation of election violence. It is a nation where partisans daydream about seeing their political opponents in jail and where the sitting president has pressed his own Justice Department to follow through. It is a nation where Black Lives Matter protesters have pressed their cause in the streets and where caravans of Trump backers have filled highways and waterways with a procession of MAGA flags.

It is a nation where faith in institutions, already dismal, was not helped by a year in which federal authorities could not safeguard their own people against a deadly disease.

And it is a nation, if voter turnout levels are instructive, that was moved as never before in modern memory to stand and be counted, in defiance of contagion and ostensible suppression. Americans braved polling places in masks and gloves, hand-delivered mail ballots just in case, waited in lines that zagged and folded over themselves across whole neighborhoods — a kind of small intestines of democracy.

“I honestly can’t say I know any institution that is working,” said Aalayah Eastmond, 19, a survivor of the Parkland, Fla., massacre and a first-time voter who has spent much of the year in Washington protesting racism and police violence. “But one thing I do know that is working is the power of the people.”

How much of the recent past can be undone, and how much the electorate wants it undone, is a question no campaign can resolve in full. There is danger in any sweeping assertion about the ideals of a country that narrowly chose to follow its first Black president with the man who pushed a racist conspiracy about that president’s birthplace.

But in some ways, given the distinctiveness of the choices, the decision in this election will be especially revealing about how America sees itself and what it expects of its leaders.

In interviews this fall, voters supporting each candidate described fears that the nation would soon appear unrecognizable to them, if it was not already. This campaign, they suggested, had doubled as a national X-ray, with both sides distressed about what might turn up on the scan.

“You learn a lot about yourself and other people and the country,” said Luke Hoffman, 36, standing outside the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia in a “Vote” mask before a recent televised forum with Mr. Biden. “The sheer polarization is terrifying.”

Katherine Smarch, 51, who traveled to Lansing, Mich., to see Eric Trump speak at a gravel pit last month, said that any pro-Trump sentiment she might express on social media was doomed to be met with taunting and hostility.

“It just feels so foreign,” she said. “This is the kind of thing that happens in a foreign country.”

Yet there is maybe some comfort, at least, in the idea that the electorate appears to be operating with mostly full information about its options.

While the stakes of a Trump presidency could still seem theoretical four years ago — “What do you have to lose?” he asked his audiences — the magnitude and responsibility of the office are by now impossible to misconstrue.

There had once been a thought that the gravity of the job might transform Mr. Trump, that America’s guardrails would check him, that the “adults in the room” (as they often liked to call themselves) would head off his most reckless impulses.

Little of it took. He is who he has been.

The institutions often bent to him, aided by Republicans in Congress. Advisers and aides came and went, and often never much disagreed with him anyway.

And in the run-up to Tuesday, Mr. Trump left little doubt that a second term would look like very much like the first: chaotic, retaliatory, uninterested in unity.

Even in the shared suffering endemic to this year of virus and relative isolation, Mr. Trump presided over partisan clashes concerning once apolitical subjects like adherence to public health guidelines, fostering divisions that trickled down to the national rank and file.

“WHERE’S YOUR MASK?” Biden supporters chanted at their counterparts protesting a Democratic car rally in Atlanta last week.

“WHERE’S YOUR DIAPER?” the president’s side called back, mocking their caution.

Mr. Trump’s array of us-versus-them closing messages in recent weeks included a meritless suggestion that doctors were inflating the coronavirus death toll for profit; an extended feud with the television program “60 Minutes”; and unsubtle hints that he would refuse to accept voting results he deemed unfavorable.

And Mr. Biden’s case often seemed to boil down to a more consistent question: Do you believe this guy?

If the whole of Mr. Trump’s tenure has often felt like a rolling challenge to precedent, the coming days may stand as a kind of super exam, particularly if the president makes premature claims about the outcome.

Of course, how Mr. Trump chooses to conduct himself has never been up to the American people. The tautological lesson he learned from his own rise always seemed to be this: If no one had the power to tell him no — or even bothered trying — it was a yes.

Mr. Trump also understands well that many millions of people are with him, win or lose, holding him up as the figure girding the nation against would-be decline and leftward creep.

“We didn’t vote for him to be our pastor or our husband,” said Penny Nance, the chief executive of Concerned Women for America, a conservative Christian group. “We voted for him to be our bodyguard.”

Mindful of Mr. Trump’s grip on his core supporters — and still traumatized from the shock of 2016 — many Democrats have only occasionally allowed themselves to consider Mr. Biden’s thesis that this president might one day be seen as a historical blip.

Both those who love and loathe Mr. Trump have tended to ascribe to him a sort of political superpower, assuming that gravity would never apply. They have rarely dwelled on the fact that he was elected despite a popular vote deficit against a 2016 opponent whom wide swaths of Americans disdained and distrusted.

“This is someone who the majority of Americans have never been open to,” Cornell Belcher, a Democratic pollster who worked on former President Barack Obama’s campaigns, said of Mr. Trump. “I understand that lightning can strike twice in the same place. But it sure as hell ain’t probable.”

Suggesting that the president’s appeal to “racial aversion” was his only “special sauce,” Mr. Belcher said the successive elections of Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump amounted to “a country grappling,” not a decisive ruling on the national direction.

Mr. Biden has presented himself as the kind of “transition candidate” capable of guiding the nation through that grappling, a bridge to whatever should come after. He outlasted a large and historically diverse primary field as the Democrat most singularly focused on removing the president and worrying about the rest later. He hammered Mr. Trump on matters of competence and integrity and asked Senator Kamala Harris to join his ticket, keeping a pledge to name a woman as his running mate and nodding to the overwhelming support Mr. Biden has enjoyed from Black voters since his election as Mr. Obama’s vice president.

It was not lost on his allies that Mr. Biden, a man of institutions, was offering himself up to a country that seemed to be losing its trust in them, one where crises of confidence have touched Congress, law enforcement and the courts.

The work of repair, he argued, was not as simple as removing Mr. Trump. That was merely a prerequisite. And while he has long professed affection for a bygone era of bipartisanship, Mr. Biden has also already run up against the realities of the moment, navigating progressive calls to expand the Supreme Court and watching Republican former Senate colleagues entertain misleading attacks on the Biden family.

If anything, the campaign’s final frames included often ubiquitous reminders of the rupture that will remain after the election — and perhaps only widen once the winner is clear.

Last week in Texas, vehicles with Trump flags and signs surrounded a Biden-Harris campaign bus and appeared to be trying to slow it down and force it to the side of the road.

Mr. Trump called the drivers supporting him “patriots” who did nothing wrong. The F.B.I. said it was investigating. Mr. Biden sounded something like a disappointed parent, waiting for the collective tantrum to pass.

“We are so much better than this,” Mr. Biden said over the weekend. “It’s not who we are.”

For better or worse, he seemed to believe it."
"With Winter Coming and Trump Still in Charge, Virus Experts Fear the Worst","WASHINGTON — Regardless of the election’s outcome this week, President Trump will be the one steering the country through what is likely to be the darkest and potentially deadliest period of the coronavirus pandemic, and he has largely excluded the nation’s leading health experts from his inner circle.

Mr. Trump will still have control of the nation’s health apparatus and the bully pulpit that comes with the Oval Office until Jan. 20, as infections approach 100,000 a day and death rates begin to rise as hospitals are strained to their breaking points.

But the president has largely shuttered the White House Coronavirus Task Force and doubled down on anti-science language, telling voters that the country is “rounding the corner” in the fight against the virus that has claimed nearly a quarter of a million lives.

He has stopped listening to Alex M. Azar II, his health secretary; Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration; and Dr. Jerome Adams, the surgeon general. On Monday, the president lashed out at Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s leading infectious disease specialist, hinting that he may fire Dr. Fauci after the election — though it would be extremely difficult for him to do so.

Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, was reduced to issuing an urgent plea on Monday for an “aggressive balanced approach that is not being implemented,” in a memo that was promptly leaked to The Washington Post.

The adviser Mr. Trump does listen to is Dr. Scott Atlas, a former Stanford neuroradiologist and late addition to the coronavirus task force who has dismissed the efficacy of mask wearing, suggested that the pandemic should be left largely to run its course — and last week parroted the president’s views on RT, the Russian television network forced to register as a foreign agent.

All of this has epidemiologists and infectious disease experts extremely worried.

“Even if Biden wins, we still have several months of the Trump administration in which the epidemic is at its worst,” said Dr. Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease expert at Emory University, referring to the president’s Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr. “Trump is not in charge. He’s given up, he has basically implied, ‘I don’t care about this’ and he has turned it over to the governors.”

Alyssa Farah, the White House communications director, defended the president’s response, saying the White House had bolstered the nation’s supply of personal protective equipment and purchased 150 million rapid coronavirus tests, items that “Dr. Birx references in her report.”

“We also continue to work to safely rush therapeutics, pushing for F.D.A. approval of remdesivir and two monoclonal antibody therapies” awaiting an emergency use authorization, she said.

Dr. Birx’s plea for a more aggressive approach reflects a growing sense of despair among public health experts inside and outside the government that the winter months are a critical moment when the government must take drastic actions to stop the spread of the virus. Several European governments have announced such measures in the last several days.

There is deep skepticism that the president will follow suit in the coming weeks.

If he wins another four years, he will take his victory as a powerful endorsement of his approach to the virus — flouting restrictions on large gatherings, ignoring calls to wear masks, demanding that schools reopen and prioritizing the economy over public health.

“We’re up ‘Schitt’s Creek’ if Trump wins — and not as good as the TV show at all,” said Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, who served as the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, referring to a popular situation comedy.

Dr. Birx is among those who have fallen out of favor with Mr. Trump after months in which she was the public face of the administration’s effort to slow the spread of the virus, standing loyally by the president’s side as he assured the public that things were getting better.

In recent weeks, though, she and Dr. Fauci have become increasingly outspoken about the dangers of the president’s approach.

It is unclear who leaked Dr. Birx’s memo on Monday. She declined to comment on Tuesday.

Dr. del Rio said he recently reached out to Dr. Birx on behalf of a reporter who wanted to know if she was distressed by the eroding of her position in the White House.

Her response, he said: “I’m distressed by the epidemic, not my position.”

Regardless, Mr. Trump has pushed her and other public health officials aside in favor of Dr. Atlas, who has at times embraced the idea that the government should protect only the most vulnerable Americans while the virus infects much of the population, increasing the percentage of people he believes will be immune to the virus. Most public health officials say that course could lead to hundreds of thousands of additional deaths.

Longtime friends say Dr. Birx is frustrated.

“She feels totally sidelined and basically thinks Scott Atlas is dangerous and crazy and is just horrified that she’s been pushed aside for somebody like that,” said Peter Staley, a longtime AIDS activist who is close to Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci. He added, “I think that has been reflected in these updates that she’s been writing.”

Mr. Staley and some fellow AIDS activists urged Drs. Birx and Fauci in mid-October to give the president an ultimatum about Dr. Atlas: “It’s him or us.” He declined to characterize their response, except to say that the two made it clear that they were not prepared to take such drastic action but would instead “try to keep pushing in their own way to cut out Atlas.”

That has been more difficult in recent weeks as the White House has all but shut down the task force on which Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx are still officially members.

Instead, the president is relying on a group of top aides — including Mark Meadows, the chief of staff; Marc Short, the vice president’s chief of staff; Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council; Dr. Atlas; and others. That group will continue to be in charge throughout the winter months.

“Fauci and Birx missed their chance,” Mr. Staley said, noting that the two doctors could have spoken out more forcefully sooner. “They had their one moment and they didn’t use it.”

Mr. Biden has said that if he is elected president, he will take a significantly different approach to the virus, moving aggressively to encourage — and possibly mandate — mask wearing and remaining open to imposing restrictions as needed to slow the spread of the virus.

Mr. Biden’s policy advisers have been developing plans that would go into effect as soon as he took office, including ramping up testing, ensuring a steady supply of protective equipment, distributing a vaccine and securing money from Congress for schools and hospitals.

Under normal circumstances — not counting Mr. Trump’s transition in 2016 — Mr. Biden would most likely wait to push those plans forward. Presidents-elect have generally chosen to stay out of the limelight until Inauguration Day, following the general principle that the United States should have one president at a time.

And departing presidents, even of opposite parties, often try to support the efforts of their successors, especially when the country is in the midst of a crisis.

But few people in Washington expect an orderly transition if Mr. Biden wins.

Mr. Trump is not likely to abide by established traditions, and he has made his views about the virus clear during numerous rallies in the final days of the campaign, telling crowds that a vaccine will soon arrive to end the threat.

“It’s ending anyway, but we have the greatest companies in the world and we’re literally weeks away,” Mr. Trump told supporters in Butler, Pa., on Saturday. “We’ll eradicate more quickly the virus, wipe out the China plague once and for all, and it’s back to work, back to work, which is what we want. You know what we want? We want normal.”

Dr. Koplan said that if Mr. Biden did prevail, he would need to move quickly to establish relationships with governors and to unveil a national strategy for the pandemic.

“Make this different from other transitions,” Dr. Koplan said, “where this time the shadow government steps out of the shadows.”"
"In ‘Knife’s Edge’ Pennsylvania, Trump’s Fortunes Rely on His Rural Base","[President-elect Joe Biden’s victory prompts spontaneous celebrations.]

BUTLER, Pa. — “Here he comes!” cried Jeannie Cook over the chomp of rotor blades as a fleet of helicopters flew out of the setting sun, blinding thousands of eyes turned toward the arrival of President Trump in the heart of red America.

No president had ever visited Butler County, according to that day’s Butler Eagle. “It almost feels like Christmas Eve,” the newspaper editorialized.

But rather than Santa Claus, it was Mr. Trump dropping in for the third of four rallies in Pennsylvania in one day, mostly in places where he had trounced Hillary Clinton in 2016. If Mr. Trump is able to outrun the polls in Pennsylvania and other battlegrounds that show him trailing Joseph R. Biden Jr., it will be because he re-energized the white blue-collar voters in places like Butler County, home to a steel mill that employs 9,000.

Supporters like Ms. Cook, 62, viewed the president in heroic terms and had no doubt that he would be re-elected. “Because he’s the greatest president,” she said.

As voters cast ballots on Tuesday, Pennsylvania loomed large as the potential tipping point for the presidency, and perhaps Mr. Trump’s best hope to maintain his hold on one of the so-called blue wall states, along with Michigan and Wisconsin, that he narrowly won four years ago to secure the White House. His advisers believe the state is on a “knife’s edge,” the closest contest on the map.

Mr. Biden spent all or part of the final three days in Pennsylvania, the surest sign of its significance, visiting his childhood home in Scranton on Tuesday.

“From this house to the White House with the grace of God,” he scrawled on the wall.

Vote counting is expected to take longer in the state than in many other key battlegrounds, and legal fights are already underway. But if Mr. Trump defies the polls, his frenetic schedule of rallies in the homestretch may deserve much of the credit, reminding his base why they voted for him in droves four years ago, when he promised to protect their jobs from foreign competition and from immigrants.

As the sun set on Saturday in Butler County, which is just north of Pittsburgh, Mr. Trump marveled at his supporters packed shoulder-to-shoulder and largely not wearing masks, despite daily records of coronavirus infections. “You can’t even see the end of people,” he beamed. “There’s a lot of people here.”

Pictures from that giant rally shook some prominent Pennsylvania Democrats. “That’s not photoshop,” John Fetterman, the state’s lieutenant governor, a Democrat, wrote in a string of Twitter warnings. “Can’t fake a crowd like that.”

Phillip Keil, who came to hear Mr. Trump, was optimistic. “I think it’s going to be a landslide,"" said Mr. Keil, 65, who owns a power-washing business in Gibsonia, Pa. Like the president, he put more faith in crowd sizes, yard signs and other omens than polling, which has the president behind an average of 5 points in Pennsylvania. Driving to the rally in a pickup festooned with Trump signs and flags, Mr. Keil said, “I had one finger given to me and five beeps and hurrahs.”

To fervent Trump supporters, many of them sealed under a dome of misinformation from the president and his media supporters, he is a champion. He has done the best that any president could have managing the coronavirus scourge, supporters say. He lowered taxes and triggered a roaring economy. He alone stands between a free Republic and an all-out assault on liberty if Democrats win control in Washington.

Watching the president’s arrival on Saturday in Butler from her porch just beyond the airport, Nadine Schoor, 63, compared his leadership of the country to that of a stern but all-knowing father.

“I look at President Trump and we’re the family — the country’s the family,"" said Ms. Schoor, who works for the county government. “And he’s the parent. He’s got a lot of tough love, and he doesn’t care what anyone thinks to get something done that he knows is right.”

All of Pennsylvania does not look like Butler County. On Election Day there were lines of people stretching out of sight in the Democratic strongholds of Philadelphia and elsewhere.

Rich Fitzgerald, the county executive of Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh, boldly predicted, “I fully expect Joe Biden to carry Allegheny County by 150,000 votes this time.” Mrs. Clinton’s margin in the county four years ago was 108,000 votes.

Mr. Trump faced a particularly uphill battle in suburban Pennsylvania, where his support among women has eroded over the last four years.

Bucks County, just outside Philadelphia, went for Mrs. Clinton by less than a percentage point in 2016. By the 2018 midterms, it went for the Democratic Senate candidate by 14 points. This year, Mr. Biden hopes to run up his margins in places like Bucks, where disaffected Republicans were not hard to find.

“I feel that Trump is just an embarrassment to the country,” said Andy Innocenti, a 62-year-old retail manager. He is a Republican but this year he voted for Mr. Biden and “Democratic right down the line” to send a message to his own party.

The Biden campaign expressed confidence that it had run up a cushion of support in early voting, after Democrats returned 1,641,000 mail-in ballots by Tuesday morning, compared to 586,000 that were returned by Republicans.

Republicans were expected to vote disproportionately in person on Tuesday, and Mr. Trump’s campaign had made a far larger investment in ground operations.

Both polling and analysis of the more than 100 million votes cast before Tuesday nationwide suggests that Mr. Trump has lost ground with college-educated voters compared to four years ago. To compensate, he must drive up his advantage with white working-class voters even higher than in 2016.

In Armstrong County, where Mr. Trump won 74 percent of the vote four years ago, Pat Fabian, a Democrat on the county commission, predicted that Mr. Biden would “shave that by 10 or 15 percent” — an improvement that if repeated across Pennsylvania would likely doom Mr. Trump.

The Trump campaign in Pennsylvania has pointed to its months of in-person canvassing and outreach to low-frequency voters, which in some counties resulted in a surge of newly registered Republicans. The state includes 2.2 million non-college-educated white voters who didn’t vote in 2016, more than in either of the other blue wall states of Michigan and Wisconsin, which had gone steadily Democratic for years until 2016.

In Bucks County on Tuesday, Wendy Hummel, a 72-year-old Republican, was waiting to cast her vote for Mr. Trump because he was “for life and not death,” referring to abortion. She was willing to overlook Mr. Trump’s own less-than-pious personal history. “He is in his walk with the Lord,” she said, “and he’s learning like the rest of us.”

Across the hallway, in a middle school where the line to vote zigzagged throughout the school and where so many cars had piled into the lot that many were parking on the grass, Jessica Voutsinas had been clutching her vote-by-mail ballot for more than two and half hours. She was concerned with Republican efforts to disqualify such ballots, and planned to surrender it and vote in person instead.

Ms. Voutsinas, 24, called herself a climate change voter and was unsure how Bucks, a swing county in a swing state, would vote.

“It seems aggressively moderate to me,” she said.

Outside the Trump rally in Butler, a supporter named Jeff, who declined to give his last name because he distrusts the media, acknowledged that “it looks bad” for Mr. Trump winning a second term. He blamed the media for not reporting the president’s successes and “the criminal activities the Biden family has been involved in.’’

Among the president’s triumphs, he named “rescuing a lot of women and children who were abducted” for sex trafficking, part of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory.

Mr. Trump has fanned myriad conspiracy theories. For months he has raged that he will only lose if the election is “rigged’’ and he has insisted that mail-in votes counted after Nov. 3, which are expected to favor Mr. Biden, would be fraudulent — a groundless charge.

In such an atmosphere, with Mr. Trump’s base unprepared to accept a loss as legitimate, Mr. Biden’s task of bringing together the country, should he become president, would be immeasurably more difficult.

On the final pre-election weekend, Emily Skopov, a Democrat running for the State Legislature, canvassed in an affluent suburb of brick homes north of Pittsburgh, where almost every resident was a registered Republican. Almost no one was willing to speak with her.

One couple who did listen to Ms. Skopov’s pitch (“I’m not a communist or a socialist!’’ she quickly said) was Brian and Patty O’Connor, whose opinions mirrored the gender gap that has imperiled Mr. Trump.

Mr. O’Connor, a lawyer, denounced Mr. Trump’s personality but said he would vote for his re-election. Ms. O’Connor said she was “embarrassed” to have voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 yet she remained undecided days before the election. “We have five kids, we put them through schools; taxes are a big issue to us,’’ she said. “We are practicing Catholics. Abortion’s a big issue — sometimes. Personally, I don’t like Donald Trump.’’

“I don’t know, I really tell you, I’m undecided,’’ she added."
"After 2016 Shock, Wisconsin Democrats Picked Themselves Off the Floor","MADISON, Wis. — If there is a symbol of the Wisconsin Democratic comeback following the shock of President Trump’s 2016 victory and nearly a decade of being beaten into submission by the Republican state legislature, it is Jill Karofsky.

Ms. Karofsky stunned most of Wisconsin, and herself, when in April she won an 11-point victory in a race for a State Supreme Court seat, during an election the state’s Republicans blocked its Democratic governor from delaying because of the coronavirus pandemic.

“I did not see a path for us to win,” Justice Karofsky said during a six-mile run on Monday. But when the polls opened April 7, she said, “I went for a run and I came home and I looked at my phone and I saw all those brave people voting in Milwaukee. And that’s when I started to have a glimmer of hope.”

For Wisconsin Democrats, hope has been something in short supply since 2010, when Republicans won control of the state’s government and began to systematically dismantle a progressive political infrastructure built up over generations.

While Justice Karofsky’s race was officially nonpartisan, her allies made the battle lines clear — the contest was a referendum on Mr. Trump and Republican governance in the state. And her victory, with its surprise margin, provided an important psychological boost to a party beaten down by the state’s dominant Republicans and still spooked by 2016, when Hillary Clinton, who never visited the state, lost Wisconsin by just 22,748 votes — a margin seared into the memory of the state’s top Democrats.

Only in the final hours of the 2020 campaign, when more than half the state’s voters had cast pre-Election Day ballots, did Wisconsin Democrats allow themselves to say out loud that they believed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. would carry the state by a healthy margin when counting was expected to be completed on Wednesday.

It is a bullishness borne of the combination of high turnout in Madison and Milwaukee, signs they had won back some rural Democrats who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, and the feeling that, since 2016, they have finally won more than they’ve lost. Democrats also believe that a recent statewide surge in coronavirus cases has helped refocus voters on the president’s handling of the pandemic.

After Mrs. Clinton’s loss in Wisconsin, Democrats here began organizing from the ground up. The Democratic National Committee and other liberal organizations began in 2017 to make investments in the state that the party neglected during the Obama years. In 2019, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin elected as its chairman Ben Wikler, a veteran Moveon.org organizer who in the last 18 months has raised record sums for the party, bringing in more than twice the funds as his Republican counterparts.

All this took place in the ashes of the devastating 2016 contest, when Democrats were certain of a victory, but disinclined to do much to make one happen.

During that campaign, Mandela Barnes, who would be elected lieutenant governor two years later, asked people to pose with him in photographs for Mrs. Clinton’s Instagram page. “People were like, ‘Ehhh, I don’t really know about that.’” Mr. Barnes said. “I was like, ‘We’re friends!’ But also, damn.”

But despite the new optimism, after so many searing defeats, there is a sense among voters that nothing is to be taken for granted.

“For the past 10 years it’s been like living with a boot on our necks,” said Andy Olsen, a policy advocate for an environmental organization who spent Tuesday morning reminding voters at Madison’s Monona Terrace to text three friends to remind them to vote, too. “We kept getting knocked down and trying to get back up again. People are cautious about getting their hopes up too much.”

Even before the April court election, there were already signs that the state’s fragile Trump coalition was crumbling. Republican margins in the Milwaukee suburbs dropped precipitously during the 2018 midterm elections, while Democrats clawed back some of the voters Mr. Trump won in 2016, especially in the Fox Valley, a key battleground region of the state.

Without Mrs. Clinton as a foil, many of these voters began to judge Mr. Trump on his own and didn’t like the results.

“I voted for Trump four years ago out of default,” said Ted Schartner, a plasterer from Green Bay who voted for Mr. Biden last Wednesday. “I regretted it almost right away. I didn’t like the way things were heading.”

While voters were coming to terms with a Trump presidency, Wisconsin Democrats found themselves digging out of their collective nadir. Not only was it the first time since 1984 that a Republican had carried the state’s electoral votes, but Democrats were locked out of state government, gerrymandered into a deep minority in the state legislature and facing a State Supreme Court controlled by conservative justices.

By the time Mr. Trump won the White House, Wisconsinites had already gotten used to the constant partisan warfare that would define his administration.

“You go to a gathering of friends and it turns into politics right away,” said Roben Haggart, who has served as Minocqua’s town clerk for 22 years. “It always turns into an argument.”

Mr. Trump’s victory here led to talk that Wisconsin, with its large population of white working-class voters, had become a fixture of the Republican Electoral College map, out of reach for Democratic candidates.

The state’s Democratic infrastructure was in shambles, but little by little voters began to turn against Mr. Trump. In January 2018, a Democrat won a special election to a rural State Senate district Mr. Trump had carried by 17 points. That fall, Democrats rode anger against Mr. Trump to a sweep of the statewide elections, ousting Scott Walker, a two-term governor who had crippled the state’s public-sector labor unions.

In June 2019, Wisconsin Democrats elected as their state chairman Mr. Wikler, who had moved his family into his childhood home in Madison. Mr. Wikler brought an organizing and fund-raising heft the state had never seen. The Democratic Party of Wisconsin has raised $58.7 million in the last two years, more than twice the haul for the state’s Republicans.

“Trump’s win, in a lot of ways, accelerated and pushed forward necessary change within our party,” said Alex Lasry, a senior official for Milwaukee’s pro basketball franchise who is weighing a run for the seat of Ron Johnson, a Republican senator, in 2022. “Democrats realized we can’t just sit on the sidelines in these off-year elections.”

Representative Mark Pocan, a Madison Democrat, said Mr. Biden’s campaign and Mr. Wikler’s leadership created a dramatically different political landscape than four years ago.

“The Biden campaign is 180 degrees different than what we had four years ago,” Mr. Pocan said. One important difference: Mr. Biden has visited Wisconsin three times since the primary. “The candidate never came post-primary four years ago, we had no resources specifically for Wisconsin — or very little resources.”

The 2016 contest was marked by a drop in turnout among Black voters in Milwaukee, who are now a key part of Mr. Biden’s hopes for a Wisconsin victory.

The Rev. Greg Lewis, the executive director of the Milwaukee Souls to the Polls effort, said the Black electorate in the city had changed, thanks in part to Mr. Trump’s presidency. Since 2012, Mr. Lewis said, the money that was absent in 2016 is now flowing to community leaders for get-out-the-vote efforts, just as Black Milwaukeeans have become more engaged in removing Mr. Trump.

“These groups weren’t active four years ago, because we didn’t have funding or resources to do any of the things we’re doing right now,” Mr. Lewis said. “I just think the Democratic Party didn’t come into the community enough to energize and make sure that people were willing to do what needs to be done.”

By October, Wisconsin’s coronavirus spike was among the worst in the country — and by far the worst of any presidential battleground state. The president’s approval rating on the pandemic in Wisconsin had fallen from 51 percent in March to just 40 percent, according to a Marquette Law School poll.

“We’ve got people that are supposed to be leading the country that have just thrown up their hands and said, there’s nothing we can do about this pandemic — which is just demonstrably not true,” said Kate Walton, an emergency room nurse in Madison who said she voted for Mr. Biden.

One after another, Biden voters across the state in the last week said their votes were motivated primarily by a desire to oust Mr. Trump.

“I wouldn’t vote for Trump for nothing, even if you paid me all the money he says he’s worth,” said Terri Konkol, a 58-year-old Milwaukeean who on Saturday voted for Mr. Biden from her wheelchair. She blamed the president for the virus’s spread in the state. “In our whole lifetimes have we ever had to wear masks?”

Rose Goeb, 62, a Milwaukee preschool teacher, voted early for Mr. Biden on one of the first days she could.

Of Mr. Trump, she said, “I made up my mind a long time ago that this man does not have the character or discipline to be president.”

And on Tuesday in Madison, among a line of voters waiting to cast ballots when the polls opened at 7 a.m. was Helen Hawley, an artist who was inspired by Senator Bernie Sanders and a fierce desire to remove Mr. Trump.

“It’s hard to be hopeful about anything right now,” said Ms. Hawley, 40. “But it’s better to have hope than to not. Hope is just something I hold onto because it’s a good idea.”

When Will We Know the Election Results?,"Election Day is finally here in the United States. So naturally many of you are wondering: When will the world know the outcome?

Unfortunately, no one knows for sure. We know, we know, you’ve waited this long, and you’re just trying to decide whether to stay up all night or go to bed and hope there’s an answer in the morning. Or on Thursday. Or Friday at the latest.

We can’t make that choice for you, but we can give you some tools to help think through the night. 

The first polls close at 6 p.m. Eastern in parts of Kentucky and Indiana, and the last don’t close until after 12 a.m. Eastern time. 

Here’s a list of when every state’s polls close, which generally means if someone hasn’t voted, or isn’t in line to vote by then, they’ve run out of time.

States start reporting some of their results as soon as their polls close. But remember, they don’t report them all at once, so you might see skewed results when you’re scrolling through the news channels or staring at The New York Times results pages.

This year especially, things are going to be a little different.

Maggie Astor, a politics reporter for The Times, explored the history of ballot counting here, amid President Trump’s recent ahistorical claim that the election “should end on November 3rd., not weeks later.”

In reality, Ms. Astor wrote, no state ever reports final results on election night, and no state is legally expected to.

Traditionally, news organizations have projected winners based on partial counts — more on that here.

This year, a big question surrounds whether enough states will have enough of their votes counted on election night for accurate projections. And depending on which states those are, we may not know immediately which candidate has actually reached the 270 votes in the Electoral College to have won the presidency. (More about the Electoral College here.)

Here’s everything you want to know about when the ballots will be counted in different states.

We asked officials about their election results processes and what share of votes they expect to be counted by Nov. 4.

It’s complicated. The Daily podcast this week outlined three of the potential scenarios, though there are many more that could make election night, and the days that follow, more complicated.

“We’ve never had an election like this before,” Alex Burns, a national political correspondent, told the host, Michael Barbaro. “It’s possible that we will have these expectations and they will be totally shattered by what actually happens on election night. It’s possible the counting could be much faster, it’s possible it could be much slower.”

Those three scenarios Mr. Burns and Mr. Barbaro describe:

Joseph R. Biden Jr. scores a significant win in one of the East Coast states that is expected to count its votes the fastest. If Mr. Biden wins Florida, for example, that’s a sign that Mr. Trump’s path to victory may be difficult. “There are not a lot of Republicans who believe that the president can win this race without Florida,” Mr. Burns said.

President Trump holds on in all of those early major East Coast states. That signals a close race, which means all eyes turn toward the Midwest.

The third is what Mr. Burns calls the “It’s a giant mess and we just don’t know anything” scenario. He describes drawn-out uncertainty: “This is Florida 2000 in several states at once.” In that case, final calls in several key states would rest on the counting of mail-in ballots, which could take days.

What the Last Pre-Election Polls Reveal About Where Things Stand,"A flood of heavily Democratic ballots has already streamed into election offices around the country during the weeks of early voting. But the presidency could turn on in-person voting today in several crucial states, with Republicans expected to outnumber Democrats going to the polls on Election Day.

[These are the key states President-elect Joe Biden won.]

Most surveys of battleground states show that President Trump is trailing Joseph R. Biden Jr. by narrow margins and has some ground to make up. If he beats Mr. Biden, pollsters at both the state and national level will have missed even more dramatically than in 2016.

In some states there are signs that the race has tightened, and in Iowa, an election-eve poll found Mr. Trump with a considerable lead. Still, while polling in many battlegrounds remains relatively close, Mr. Biden seems to be entering Election Day from a position of strength.

Here’s a look at the last major pre-election polls released in five swing states, with an eye toward what they say about the way the broader winds are blowing.

If the election comes down to one state, it will most likely be Pennsylvania, which Mr. Trump narrowly won four years ago.

Polls suggest the state may be more firmly in the Biden column than most of his big targets in the Sun Belt — but not as favorable to him as Wisconsin and Michigan, the other two Northern states that flipped Mr. Trump’s way in 2016.

Several pollsters canvassing likely voters in Pennsylvania over the past week found Mr. Biden ahead by five to seven percentage points: Morning Call/Muhlenberg College, NBC News/Marist College, Monmouth University, ABC News/The Washington Post and The New York Times/Siena College.

Were Mr. Biden to win Pennsylvania and hold onto the Upper Midwest, he could probably afford to lose other key states — Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas — and still capture the presidency. (Although possible, a Trump sweep of those states appears unlikely.)

If either candidate has momentum, it may be the president. Mr. Biden’s lead in Pennsylvania polling averages has steadily narrowed since mid-October. But the Democratic nominee’s political vitals look fairly good. According to the Times/Siena poll, his lead among state’s nonwhite voters is more than 50 percentage points, and he holds a considerable advantage among independents and a 22-point lead with white voters holding college degrees.

If Mr. Biden wins Florida, he may do so while proving that a Democrat can win the state without the resounding support of its large Hispanic population. The latest Times/Siena poll found him winning 55 percent of Florida’s Latino voters, and in a dead heat with Mr. Trump among Hispanic men. An NBC/Marist poll of Florida last week showed Mr. Biden falling below 50 percent among Hispanic voters.

But Mr. Biden has made up for his weakness among Latino voters with strong support from suburbanites, white women with college degrees and, in some parts of the state, older voters. In the Times/Siena poll, Mr. Biden was up by three points among all likely voters in the state, including a 10-point lead among political independents. (Marist gave him a four-point advantage among all likely voters.)

Mr. Trump’s fate will most likely depend on strong support from conservative senior enclaves like Sumter County, a boost from the conservative-leaning Cuban-American population and high turnout among his base of white working-class voters, particularly in smaller towns and rural areas.

This year is looking as if it could be the moment when Arizona flips to the Democrats for the first time this millennium. Mr. Trump’s rise has helped to speed up the phenomenon; two years ago, the backlash to his first term swept Kyrsten Sinema, the state’s Democratic senator, into office.

This year, polling suggests that Mark Kelly, an astronaut and Democratic Senate candidate, is on the verge of joining Ms. Sinema in Washington and ousting Senator Martha McSally.

Mr. Biden had consistently led in polls of the state for much of the race, and the final Times/Siena poll showed him up by six points. But other polls have found Arizona drifting back in Mr. Trump’s direction; an NBC/Marist poll out Monday showed a tied race.

Georgia is another state that could be on the verge of flipping from Republican to Democrat, and it has even bigger implications for the Senate. There are two seats open in the chamber, and in both cases the Democrat in the race is polling strongly. Both Senate races, however, could head to runoff elections in January if no candidate reaches 50 percent of the vote.

While Mr. Biden is leaning heavily on the support of the state’s large Black population, he has also eroded Mr. Trump’s backing among white voters, particularly those with college degrees. If he can break the 30-percent threshold among white voters, his chances of winning Georgia will improve.

A Monmouth poll last week found Mr. Biden meeting that target, pulling 31 percent of the state’s white voters, while holding a four-point advantage over Mr. Trump over all.

If there’s any poll that has shown tangible evidence of a late break toward Mr. Trump, it’s the Des Moines Register/Selzer & Company poll of Iowa, which is widely considered to be a gold standard. A Selzer survey released over the weekend found Mr. Trump opening up a seven-point lead among likely voters, after being tied with Mr. Biden in September.

The poll showed the president winning back the support of independents — a rarity for him in swing states this year — and cutting Mr. Biden’s lead among women in the heavily white state down to the single digits. The poll found that, even as coronavirus cases have spiked in the state recently, most Iowans do not consider the pandemic their No. 1 issue. The Selzer poll also found that Joni Ernst, the state’s Republican senator, was up four points on her Democratic challenger, Theresa Greenfield.

If Mr. Trump is going to win enough states to retain the presidency, he will need a lot more situations like this."
How Long Is This Going to Take? Americans Settle In to Wait,"They warned us. They said it would not be over right away. They said it could take days for all the votes to be counted. They told us to wait for the slow gears of democracy to grind toward a conclusion.

Or, as Ian Dunt, a British political journalist, said on Twitter: “There’s not enough booze in all the world for sitting through the American election results.”

As Tuesday night wore on and it became clear that what each side had hoped for — a definitive win that would end this election for good — was unlikely to materialize, it was important to remember what Jim Kenney, the mayor of Philadelphia, had asked of his city before Election Day began: “Patience.”

“After the polls close, and in the ensuing days, we will continue to need your patience,” he wrote in an open letter to his city. “Never in the history of this city have so many people voted by mail. By law, staffers are not allowed to start opening and counting these ballots until Election Day itself.”

Mr. Kenney noted that the results in Pennsylvania — and, by extension, the rest of the country — might not be known for a while. That’s the message election officials everywhere have been trying to emphasize, as they cope with the pandemic reality of a record number of mail-in ballots.

“This has been the slow-moving election from hell with all the early voting,” Drew McKissick, the chairman of South Carolina’s Republican Party, said on Monday, eagerly anticipating its end. “It’s been draining.”

The overriding prediction has been that getting through this election would indeed take patience, although it’s anyone’s guess for how long. (How long is a piece of string? It feels as if the country is playing a brutal, penalty-filled soccer game that will almost certainly go into extra time — but we don’t yet know how long that extra period will last.)

The specter of civil unrest has loomed large in the mind of voters like Paulino Leon, 70, a Tucson, Ariz., voter who identifies as an independent. On Tuesday, he said he was confident of a Biden victory, but was not sure that President Trump would accept the results.

“I bought canned food and have things set up in my house so I can stay there for at least two months,” he said. “And I’ve got my guns.”

Stationed outside a polling station in Atlanta’s historically Black West End neighborhood so that he could help direct residents of a local senior center to their proper polling place at a nearby library, Mark Robinson, 55, noticed two things in the parking lot: a big, gray-black Dodge Ram pickup truck festooned with flags and operated by a driver who exited the lot after being spotted, and a Chevrolet Suburban occupied by an agent from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, there to ensure that the voting ran smoothly.

Mr. Robinson said he felt as if violence was “almost assured” in America on Election Day. “I don’t think I’m being pessimistic,” he said, referring to Mr. Trump’s recent comments about the far-right Proud Boys group. “I mean, the president said ‘Stand back and stand by,’” he said. “I’m presuming that’s what they’re doing.”

In Minneapolis, Justin Salzl, 41, said he planned to vote for Mr. Trump, despite finding the president too brash and tweet-happy. He also said his plan was to vote and then “go dark” — order takeout sushi with his family, go to bed without watching the news and check the results in the morning.

That may be the smart approach. According to Kate Sweeny, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Riverside, anticipatory dread only increases as waiting continues.

“Quite a lot of research suggests that the worst is yet to come as far as anxiety,” said Professor Sweeny, who specializes in the psychology of waiting.

“Even people who are general optimists show a decline in optimism as the moment of truth draws nearer,” she said.

Contributing to the current difficulty is that no one seemed able to predict when this nirvanic (or hellish, depending) “moment of truth” might actually arrive. That left people fretting and obsessing even more, particularly about the direction they see the country going in.

“As individuals, we’ve all developed more of a capacity for hate,” said Angela Smith, 35, one of about a dozen people waiting to vote at the Bigler Street polling place in South Philadelphia Tuesday morning. “We are all capable of hating in a way that I didn’t think was possible until now.”

Ms. Smith, a teacher, mostly laid the blame on the Trump administration, which she said had sent out misinformation “and all kinds of things that get people churning and burning.”

“In my lifetime, I’ve never seen anything like this in America,” she said.

Michael Miller, director and co-founder of the New York Meditation Center, said it was important not to play out unpleasant situations in one’s head.

“This whole season has been focused on speculating about what is going to happen,” he said. “But getting caught up in the moment-by-moment question of what results are coming in — that has never been good practice.”

Stay in the present, he counseled. Clean your oven, rake some leaves, go for a walk, take off your shoes, feel the carpet on your feet. Breathe.

“If you think, ‘Don’t think about the election, don’t think about the election, don’t think about the election,’ then the election has become your mantra,” he said, “and that’s not going to do you any good.”

All day, officials exhorted the public to stay calm and not to expect a result too quickly.

In a joint statement, officials from a disparate coalition of groups — the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; the National Association of Evangelicals; the A.F.L.-C.I.O; and the National African American Clergy Network — implored people to wait peacefully until every last vote had been counted.

“With voting ending today, it is imperative that election officials be given the space and time to count every vote in accordance with applicable laws,” the statement said. “We call on the media, the candidates and the American people to exercise patience with the process and trust in our system, even if it requires more time than usual.

“It is important to remember that challenges are a normal part of every election,” the statement read. “We are confident our country and its institutions can rise to this historic moment.”

Good luck along the way.

“What is the German word for ‘feeling physically nauseous from anxiety at the news but also morbidly unable to look away and stop scrolling,’” the novelist Celeste Ng wrote on Twitter.

Mac Stipanovich, a Republican strategist and lobbyist in Florida who was intimately involved in the slow-burn nightmare of the 2000 election (his candidate won, but still), said that in many ways, it’s easier to be a campaign operative or a volunteer during stressful elections. Even if the tide is going against you, you’re too busy doing your job to indulge in your distress.

“It’s like having a broken foot and then being shot in the other leg — you don’t notice the foot so much,” he said.

Things are harder for regular voters whose civic engagement consists, basically, of one moment of voting followed by a million moments of catastrophizing.

“I try to distract myself,” Mr. Stipanovich said on Monday. “Yesterday I walked for seven miles. Today I’m mowing and edging. I might go for a drive.”

He was also trying to avoid flaming his enemies on social media. “I will scan Twitter looking for news stories in which the vice chairman of the Republican Party of Florida pops up and says something dumb,” Mr. Stipanovich said. “Whereas I would have engaged in the past, now I don’t, because it’s pointless.”

Judy Betty, a 79-year-old retired school principal from Marana, Ariz., a suburb of Tucson, said on Monday that her mood was swinging like a pendulum between manic and depressed, depending on which news sources she listened to and which polls she read. As a Trump supporter, she said she had been heartened by the size and enthusiasm of the crowds at his most recent rallies.

Her husband, Jim, a retired accountant, declared that if the president were to lose, he would liquidate the family’s stocks on Wednesday.

For her part, Ms. Betty said that she intended to watch the election results roll in on TV Tuesday night. The plan, at least as far as she had a plan, was to limit herself to “one cocktail.”

Election Day in California,"Good Election Day morning.

The sun was shining through a layer of haze on Monday afternoon as Dodgers fans, sporting their jerseys and caps, streamed into the upper deck of the stadium. Oldies blared from an unseen speaker, workers barked out directions and cheers intermittently erupted from inside.

Walking toward the stadium gates was a rare moment of near-normalcy — although, like everything these days, it wasn’t.

Everyone I saw wore a mask. Many of those masks were Dodger blue and emblazoned with the words “World Champions,” in honor of the team’s first World Series win in more than three decades, which took place last week — in Arlington, Texas.

The surrounding parking lot has in recent months been the county’s biggest coronavirus testing site, where thousands of Angelenos have been instructed by the mayor, projected on giant screens, to swab their mouths in their cars.

And the bursts of applause weren’t related to anything happening on the empty field, of course. Still, they marked something pretty momentous: First-time voters successfully casting their ballots.

One of those first-time voters was Abraham Pacheco, 19, a Cal State Northridge student who was born and raised nearby.

He said he preregistered to vote when he was 17.

“I saw it as a responsibility,” he said, “especially coming from a Hispanic family.”

Mr. Pacheco said he’d been paying attention to issues like Proposition 22 — he voted no — and was happy to make his voice heard.

[See The Times’s full voter guide for Californians, with information about how, when and where to cast your ballot. | Leer en español.]

But he said it was particularly exciting to vote at the stadium with his father and grandfather, the latter of whom was decked out in a Dodgers shirt, mask and hat. He’d played on the field as a high schooler and celebrated the World Series win.

“Since birth, I’ve been a huge Dodgers fan,” he said.

For Helena Herrera, 19, who came to the stadium to vote for the first time with her mother and younger sister, casting a ballot for her future was an imperative. The idea of young people sitting out the election, as they have tended to historically, was a motivator.

“Things are going to start affecting us,” she said.

Ms. Herrera said that she didn’t closely follow the state ballot propositions — although she voted on some based on other supporters. The most pressing issue in her eyes was voting out the president, which she said would allow the country to “go back to the humanity we once knew.”

The pandemic had also affected her and her family. Ms. Herrera started college at San Jose State University, but with most in-person classes canceled, she’d opted to attend community college instead.

Her mother, Bebe Herrera, 46, said she also voted for Joseph R. Biden Jr., even though he wasn’t her first choice for the Democratic nomination. She said she valued the stability she believed a Biden administration would bring.

More important, she said, she wanted to encourage her children to be engaged.

“I wanted her to feel like she exercised her voice,” she said, nodding at her daughter. “If she doesn’t get out there and change it, it won’t change.”

That the family had cast their ballots at Dodger Stadium just made the experience more meaningful.

Elsewhere in Los Angeles and in other cities, storefronts were being boarded up and police officers were preparing for postelection unrest.

But in Chavez Ravine, at about 3:15 p.m. Monday, on the eve of one of the most consuming elections of our lives, in the midst of a pandemic that will define a generation, voters, families and poll workers were cheerful — hopeful, even.

They took selfies with their specially designed “I voted” stickers and picked up free meals from a World Central Kitchen truck parked out front, while volunteers from the mutual aid group Hydrate LA offered fruit, bags of chips, water and pouches of Capri Sun.

Dehava McLaurin, 54, from Long Beach, called out to voters as they headed up the steps: “Right this way! Come on up to vote!”

Mr. McLaurin said he’d signed up to help at the polls because he knew the pandemic was preventing many people who normally volunteer from showing up.

“Who wouldn’t want to be here? It’s so beautiful,” he said. “And I’m being of service.”

"U.S. Cyber Command Expands Operations to Hunt Hackers From Russia, Iran and China","FORT MEADE, Md. — The United States Cyber Command expanded its overseas operations aimed at finding foreign hacking groups before the election on Tuesday, an effort to identify not only Russian tactics but also those of China and Iran, military officials said.

In addition to new operations in Europe to pursue Russian hackers, Cyber Command sent teams to the Middle East and Asia over the past two years to help find Iranian, Chinese and North Korean hacking teams and identify the tools they were using to break into computer networks.

Cyber Command was expanding on a push begun in 2018, when it sent teams to North Macedonia, Montenegro and other countries to learn more about Russian operations. The move also reflects a stepped-up effort to secure this year’s presidential election.

Cyber Command, which runs the military’s offensive and defensive operations in the online world, was largely on the sidelines in 2016. But for the 2018 midterm elections, the command took a far more aggressive posture. In addition to sending the teams to allied countries, it sent warning messages to would-be Russian trolls before the vote, in its first offensive operation against Moscow; it then took at least one of those troll farms offline on Election Day and the days afterward.

The 2018 operation was focused mostly on Russia, according to what is publicly known about it. But before the election this year, intelligence officials have described efforts by Iran and China, as well as Russia, to potentially influence the vote, and Cyber Command has also widened its focus.

“Since 2018, we have expanded our hunt forward operations to all major adversaries,” Lt. Gen. Charles L. Moore Jr., the deputy head of Cyber Command, said in an interview in his office at Fort Meade.

Cyber Command calls its work with allies to find enemy hackers “hunt forward operations.” After getting close to foreign adversaries’ own networks, Cyber Command can then get inside to identify and potentially neutralize attacks on the United States, according to current and former officials.

“We want to find the bad guys in red space, in their own operating environment,” General Moore said. “We want to take down the archer rather than dodge the arrows.”

Officials would identify only regions and not the countries they had operated in before the 2020 election. But Cyber Command officials said those efforts uncovered malware being used by adversarial hacking teams. Other government agencies used that information to help state and local officials shore up their election system defenses and to notify the public about threats.

Cyber Command sends teams of experts overseas to work with partner and allied nations to help them find, identify and remove hostile intrusions on their government or military computer networks.

For the allied nations, inviting Cyber Command operatives not only helps improve their network defenses but also demonstrates to adversaries that the United States military is working with them. For the United States, the deployments give their experts an early look at tactics that potential adversaries are honing in their own neighborhoods, techniques that could later be used against Americans.

The information gathered in the hunt forward operations was shared with the rest of the U.S. government to help defend critical networks before the election, Gen. Paul M. Nakasone, the head of Cyber Command, wrote in an article in Foreign Affairs in August.

Cybersecurity experts have argued that the deployments allow Cyber Command to work alongside partner teams that are under daily attack by Russia, Iran or China.

“The best way to get intelligence is through true cooperation and collaboration with other teams combating it,” said Theresa Payton, a cybersecurity expert and a former official under the George W. Bush administration. “They will have received different types of targeted attacks you may not have seen.”

Cyber Command officials said they continued to try to identify and stop foreign threats to the election after the midterm vote in 2018, adding new partners to their defensive network.

“The attacks are always ongoing; that is why Cyber Command’s ongoing work with other countries’ military cyberoperations is our best way to be on offense to protect American interests,” said Ms. Payton, whose book “Manipulated” examined emerging types of cyberattacks.

Some lawmakers and experts believe that foreign influence efforts could increase should there be a disputed election result, amplifying claims of fraud or demands for recounts.

Similarly, Cyber Command officials said their efforts to try to counter foreign threats would not end with the close of voting on Tuesday; they will continue as votes are counted and the Electoral College prepares to meet in December.

“We are not stopping or thinking about our operations slacking off on Nov. 3,” General Moore said. “Defending the election is now a persistent and ongoing campaign for Cyber Command.”"
What to Watch For as the Polls Close and the Counting Begins,"[President-elect Joe Biden’s victory prompts spontaneous celebrations.]

The night the nation has been waiting for — and in some quarters dreading — is finally here.

For four years, President Trump has run a permanent re-election campaign from the White House, hoping to recreate his 2016 victory, while Democrats have worked to ensure that a president who lost the popular vote by close to three million votes was limited to one term in office.

A pandemic changed both the stakes of the election and how the campaign season unfolded for both candidates. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. leaned heavily on television advertising and limited his campaign appearances, while Mr. Trump tried to soldier on with outdoor rallies that often violated local health restrictions.

None of it made voters less motivated: Nearly 100 million people cast their ballots early, more than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast in the 2016 election.

Here’s what to watch for on Election Day.

Polls will begin closing at 6 p.m. Eastern in parts of Kentucky and Indiana, and the first results will begin rolling in soon after that. Both are securely in the Trump column.

After that, there are a few states that may determine early on whether this election might be resolved Tuesday night — or whether we are in for a long week or (yikes) month.

If Mr. Biden wins Georgia, Florida or North Carolina, Mr. Trump has an even slimmer path to victory.

Polls begin closing in Florida at 7 p.m. Eastern (polls in the Panhandle, which is on Central time, will close an hour later). Florida officials have already processed the state’s record-breaking early vote, which has been almost evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats. Watch for those to be announced shortly after 8 p.m.

Unless the margin is razor thin — it’s been known to happen in Florida — there is a good chance that the state will be called before bedtime on the East Coast.

Polls in Georgia also close at 7 p.m. Final results could be known within a few hours as well.

North Carolina’s polls close at 7:30 p.m. Most of the early vote there has already been counted, so this is another state that is likely to be called Tuesday, unless it is very close.

If Mr. Biden does not win any of those three states (or Texas, where most of the state polls close at 8 p.m.), that will ratchet up the importance of the so-called blue wall of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which Mr. Trump flipped from Democrats in 2016 and where polls show Mr. Biden ahead. Mr. Trump needs to hold on to just one of them to win re-election, assuming he keeps the rest of his 2016 winning map. That’s a big assumption: He is defending a half-dozen states he won in 2016, and slightly trailing in some polls in Georgia and Arizona.

It all may come down to Pennsylvania. Polls there close at 8 p.m., but Pennsylvania won’t begin counting its early votes until Wednesday morning. The in-person voting is expected to be overwhelmingly Republican, so Mr. Trump may jump out to an early-night lead.

Don’t get misled; the early voting has been overwhelmingly Democratic. Polling shows Mr. Biden with a narrow lead in Pennsylvania, though Mr. Trump’s poll-defying victory there in 2016 — and the effort by his campaign this time to turn out first-time voters who Republicans say have been overlooked by pollsters — has made this state one of the big mysteries of the night. It could take days to finish counting Pennsylvania’s votes.

Polls in Wisconsin close at 9 p.m. Eastern, but the state’s municipal clerks won’t begin to count early votes until the polls open the morning of Election Day; a tight race might mean it will take a day or more before a winner is declared. In Milwaukee, the state’s largest city, officials said they would not release the results of any early voting until all ballots were counted — a process that isn’t likely to end until around 4 a.m. Wednesday.

The final poll closing in Michigan is 9 p.m. as well, though most of the state’s polls will be closed at 8 p.m. Early voting has been heavy here as well, and counting those votes didn’t begin until Monday. This is another one that could take awhile.

There will be a few later-night states out West that are worth keeping in mind: Nevada, which Mr. Trump has sought to pull back from the Democrats, and Arizona, which Mr. Biden has been trying to put into the Democratic column.

Four years ago, a superstitious Mr. Trump did not have a victory speech written before election night. Now, with the president expecting no definitive winner on Tuesday night, and his campaign lawyers trying to use state rules to stop the counting of mail-in votes after Election Day, he has no plans to deliver any sort of concession.

That’s a confident posture that will be tested if Mr. Trump loses Florida, which would all but close off his already narrow path to re-election. Aides said they expected him to declare victory if he won Florida, but it’s not clear what it would mean even if he did. A win in Florida would keep him in the race, but attention would then turn immediately to the Northern battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.

Like the election itself, Mr. Trump’s Tuesday night plans are still in flux. The White House has invited 400 people to the East Room and was planning for everyone attending to be tested for the coronavirus. There was no official invitation sent to many guests invited: The president’s secretary called them to extend the invitation personally. But officials said they expected a lot of attrition and were not certain how many people would show up.

Some of the president’s closest allies in the Senate, like Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, will be back in their home states watching their own election results. Several Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill have declined invitations to fly aboard Air Force One or visit the White House grounds since it became clear that the president and his staff were not adhering to the C.D.C.’s health guidelines.

And then there’s this: Many people in the president’s circle think he is likely to lose. A brief burst of optimism a few weeks ago has settled into concern about their own careers, post-Trump. Coupled with expectations of large protests around the White House, and the coronavirus, it was not seen by all invitees as the see-and-be-seen event of the year.

Tuesday is the day Mr. Biden has been waiting for since he first began thinking about running for president in the early 1980s, and it will look nothing like he imagined. There will be no party, no raucous election night headquarters and no big speech to a room of cheering supporters, win or lose.

Mr. Biden never expected the capstone of his political career to fall during a pandemic — or against an opponent already making noise about declaring victory before all the votes are counted.

In one last push to win Pennsylvania, where early voting has lagged, the former vice president will make Election Day stops in Scranton, where he was born, and Philadelphia, where Black turnout four years ago was lower than forecast. Mr. Biden is expected to deliver remarks sometime late Tuesday night or Wednesday morning from Wilmington, Del., but if the result remains in flux he may wait.

It’s unclear what Mr. Biden would do if Mr. Trump declared himself the winner before there was clarity in enough states to accrue the necessary 270 electoral votes. Mr. Biden, after a campaign premised largely on the idea of returning to presidential norms, would be stepping far out of character if he too called himself the winner before results were known in enough states.

If he wins, Mr. Biden will be at a major inflection point for his party whenever he finally speaks before a national television audience. Having built a diverse coalition held together mainly by its antipathy toward Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden’s first moves as president-elect will provide distinct clues about what sort of presidency he hopes to lead — and how he may navigate what could be the most contentious presidential transition since 1876, when Rutherford B. Hayes and Samuel Tilden disputed the result of the election up until two days before the inauguration.

Control of the Senate is also among the biggest issues being decided Tuesday, with the result going a long way toward determining the contours of the federal government for at least the next two years.

If Mr. Biden wins the presidency, Democrats need to flip a net of three Senate seats to take control of the chamber; if Mr. Trump is re-elected, they will need four.

There are 12 competitive Republican-held seats; two Senate Democrats have competitive races.

The biggest prize is Georgia, where Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler both face stern tests from the Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock (Ms. Loeffler also faces a challenge from the Republican Representative Doug Collins, in a special all-in primary). The state requires a winner to get at least 50 percent of the vote, or else either contest (or both) will be decided in a runoff in January.

Polling suggests Democrats are favored to pick up seats held by Senators Cory Gardner of Colorado and Martha McSally of Arizona, and lose the one held by Senator Doug Jones of Alabama.

The other big tossup contests are in Maine and North Carolina, where the Republican Senators Susan Collins and Thom Tillis face fierce challenges from the Democrats Sara Gideon and Cal Cunningham.

Most of these candidates’ fates are likely tied to the result of the presidential race in their states. In 2016, Republican Senate candidates won every state Mr. Trump carried, while Democrats won every state that backed Hillary Clinton.

Democratic candidates in Kansas, Montana and South Carolina, where Mr. Biden has not competed, and Iowa, where Mr. Trump leads in the latest polling, have raised record-shattering amounts of money in hopes they can outperform the top of their ticket.

With control of the House unlikely to change, the ability of Democratic candidates for Senate in these states to outrun Mr. Biden may determine the shape of Congress next year.

This might be the biggest question of the night. Or the week. The first thing to watch for is what the two candidates do if Mr. Biden wins Florida. Many Democrats speculate (hope might be a better word) that it would lead Mr. Trump to confront a difficult reality and concede. That is probably unlikely. But consider this: Should he take Florida, there will be pressure on Mr. Biden to declare victory quickly, especially from Democrats who remember what happened in Florida in 2000 when Al Gore, the Democrat, prematurely conceded to George W. Bush.

If Mr. Trump holds on to Florida, watch out for the lawyers. There are likely to be legal challenges — mainly from Mr. Trump — to early votes cast across the country. Mr. Trump has laid the groundwork with his unfounded warnings about voter fraud and by dispatching lawyers ready to challenge the legitimacy of votes cast. And if Pennsylvania is close, expect that state to be ground zero for legal action that could keep this election unresolved right through Thanksgiving."
It’s Election Day. Here Goes Nothing.,"How long will it take for this hurricane of an election to pass? We can only wait and see. It’s Election Day, and this is your politics tip sheet. Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.

Major department stores across Manhattan were boarding up their windows yesterday, preparing for what some feared could be a chaotic aftermath to the election today.

The harried preparations — turning much of the city into a “sea of plywood,” as our Metro reporters Michael Gold and Ali Watkins described it — evoked an entire nation preparing for a hurricane, unsure of the destruction it might wreak.

Although Joe Biden holds a sizable lead in most polls, and a last batch of quality surveys released yesterday largely affirmed that picture, it’s clear that no matter who wins, large parts of the country will see an apocalyptic storm cloud rising from the election results.

President Trump has done his best to seed the ground for a wave of outrage and disbelief if he loses. He called Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama “criminals” during a rally yesterday in North Carolina. Speaking in Pennsylvania later in the day, he cryptically implied that the state’s decision to count absentee ballots received after Election Day could be “physically dangerous” to Pennsylvanians, without explaining what he meant.

To a large extent, as Maggie Haberman, Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin report, he’s being egged on by staff members who have repeatedly placated the president by telling him that an Electoral College is all but guaranteed.

He even dared to dream of making an 11th-hour play for Democratic strongholds like New Mexico — an idea that some aides had to gently walk him away from.

The Biden campaign is trying to get ahead of any attempts by Trump’s team to control the message tonight. Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, Biden’s campaign manager, said that with so many ballots to be counted in so many different ways all over the country, “under no scenario” would Biden accept a Trump declaration of victory on election night.

“When Donald Trump says that ballots counted after midnight should be invalidated, he’s just making that up,” she added, speaking on a call with reporters. “There is no historical precedent that any of our elections have ever run and been counted and completely verified on election night. We do not expect that to happen in 2020.”

With both campaigns steeling themselves for what could be a drawn-out series of legal fights over ballot counting in battleground states, a federal judge yesterday shut down a Republican effort to throw out more than 100,000 ballots in Harris County, Texas, a heavily contested area. It probably put a nail in the coffin of that effort — which had also been shot down in a state-level court — but many more are sure to come down in the days ahead.

A final batch of polls from Quinnipiac University bore good news for Biden in Florida, Ohio and nationwide. Quinnipiac’s surveys have been among the more favorable to Biden throughout this campaign season, and he’ll certainly be satisfied if these results are borne out: He was up by four among likely voters in Ohio, five in Florida and 11 nationwide.

A victory in Florida would be particularly meaningful for either candidate — not only because of its crucial 29 electoral votes but also because its elections officials have gotten a head start on counting mail-in ballots, meaning Florida is among the more likely battlegrounds to be able to declare a winner fairly swiftly.

Looking out across the landscape of pre-election polls, with little evidence to suggest any meaningful slide in Biden’s support as Election Day has arrived, it appears hard for Trump to pull off a victory unless polls fail even more stupendously than they did in 2016. There’s just one pollster who called the election’s surprise results in 2016, and who thinks Trump is going to win again.

Granville Vitamvas, 4, helped his mother, Golda Vitamvas, cast a ballot in Omaha on Monday.

Our correspondents are fanned out across the country to cover the action at voting places today and the candidates’ last-minute campaign stops. Then, as polls begin to close in battleground states as early as 7 p.m. Eastern tonight, you can follow along with us at nytimes.com as our team brings you complete results and live analysis.

To see when polls are closing across the country, you can use this handy, state-by-state guide, which also tells you how likely we are to have a winner called tonight in each state.

Georgia will be one of the first states to wrap things up, with voting officially coming to an end at 7 p.m. across the state — although long lines there have been known to keep some locations open late, particularly in Democratic areas. It’s safe to assume you’ll have to wait awhile for all of the votes to be counted in Georgia, where both Senate seats are open this year and the presidential race is neck-and-neck. Officials there have said to expect calls by the next day.

North Carolina will be close behind, closing its final polling places at 7:30. Officials there have said they expect 98 percent of all ballots to be counted by the end of the night.

On the other side of the Sun Belt, in the hotly contested state of Arizona, polls won’t close until 9 p.m. Eastern. But considering its long history of no-excuse absentee balloting and its relative lack of voting-related legal drama this year, there’s a strong chance we will have a winner there tonight.

As the results roll in, you’ll probably have a hard time keeping your eyes off The Upshot’s hypnotic forecasting “needles.” We promise, they’re there to inform you — not to fray your last nerve. Because of the complications of voting amid the coronavirus pandemic, and the way it has affected vote reporting, we’re able to provide needles tracking the likelihood of a Trump and Biden victory in only three swing states: Florida, North Carolina and Georgia. You can read here about the complex work that goes into preparing the needles for prime time, and why they’ll prove informative as the night wears on.

How to Survive Your Election Day Anxiety,"Owen Keehnen, a writer and historian in Chicago, is losing sleep over the election. About five times a week over the past few months, he wakes up around 3 a.m. in a panic, he said.

“As the election approaches, I feel an overwhelming amount of anxiety,” Mr. Keehnen, 60, said. “So much seems to hinge on the election when it comes to rights down the line and everything else. It’s really wreaked havoc on my sleep.”

About 800 miles south in West Columbia, S.C., Monica L. Amick-Cassidy, a former state employee, has so far this election season managed her anxiety, which she says sets off her depression.

Ms. Amick-Cassidy 45, said she felt most stressed while scrolling through Facebook, where she spots stories from her local news station.

“I try to put my phone down and step away from it and read or knit, but reading Facebook and Twitter is almost an addiction,” she said.

Mr. Keehnen and Ms. Amick-Cassidy are not alone in managing stress this election cycle, a reality only amplified by the coronavirus pandemic.

About two-thirds of Americans in 2017 said concern about the future of the country was a significant source of their stress over money and work, according to a report published that year by the American Psychological Association titled “Stress in America: The State of Our Nation.”

The survey found a majority of people from both political parties were stressed about what it described as the “current social divisiveness,” but those figures were higher for Democrats at 73 percent, compared with Republicans at 56 percent and independents at 59 percent, it said.

A 2019 study in PLOS One showed that engaging in politics can have negative consequences on one’s health and friendships. Those on the political right, the study found, reported fewer negative impacts compared with those on the left.

Researchers found that of the 800 people surveyed, about 18 percent said politics had caused them to lose sleep and more than 29 percent said they had lost their temper because of politics. More than 11 percent said politics had adversely affected their physical health and more than 26 percent said they had become depressed when a preferred candidate lost.

And now, here it is: Election Day 2020. After billions of dollars spent on campaigning over an especially heightened and stress-filled year, there is, finally, an end in sight.

But the last polls in the United States don’t close until 1 a.m. Eastern, and even then there are multiple scenarios under which we may not know the results for quite some time after. So here are some tips on how to survive the many long hours between now and then, no matter which candidate you’re pulling for.

Is the election giving you nervous energy? Click on this.

You might be a lot like Ms. Amick-Cassidy — reading news on your phone, and then sometimes feeling more stressed about it. On Election Day especially, reconsider just how much you want to be glued to your device.

Allison Eden, an associate professor of communication at Michigan State University, said that while paying attention to the election results is critical, establishing the necessary limitations may help you get through. She suggested deleting social media apps like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok from your phone. Making them just a little harder to access can help.

“You’d have to access it through a website or some not-easily-available device,” she said of the apps. “But if you take the logo off your phone, you’re less likely to click on it.” Eliminating notifications can also help ease stress, she said.

The same goes for your television. Keeping cable news on all day in the background, when there are no results to report, might just stress you out even more.

“Sometimes it’s hard for people to even know they have a problem until they start checking how much time they’re spending” on their phones consuming news or watching it on television, Professor Eden said. 

There are a lot of hours to fill before any results will begin to trickle in.

Professor Eden suggested changing environments as a means to control any anxiety. 

You could also try putting your phone in a different room in hopes that the fatigue will outweigh the desire to check the news.

Dr. Brittany LeMonda, a senior neuropsychologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, suggested putting the hours usually spent reading articles or poring over news toward something that brings you joy. “Go for a long walk or watch movies that make you feel good,” she said. “Go to a bookstore, and find a new book to read. Go out to a cafe and have a socially distanced lunch; something that’s going to fill up your cup a little bit.”

OK, you’ve made it through most of the day and some returns have begun trickling in around 6 p.m. Eastern time, when some of the first polls close.

It’s important not to expect any full results for a number of reasons but mainly because the increase in mail voting as a result of the pandemic may delay full results in several key states. Some states, like Michigan and Pennsylvania, may not have official counts for several days.

And remember, the results at the beginning and at the end of the night will be skewed in some places because of the order in which different types of votes are reported.

Even if you’ve gotten through the day, your stress may not disappear.

“It’ll be a roller coaster,” said Dr. Victor Fornari, a psychiatrist at Northwell Health Hospital on Long Island. “Those emotions will be riding for a long time. Uncertainty breeds anxiety. I think that this will be a very anxious period of time because people, as I said, are so passionately one way or the other, and that level of anxiety is going to cause a great amount of stress.”"
Birx Issues Blunt Coronavirus Warning Starkly at Odds With Trump,"WASHINGTON — Dr. Deborah L. Birx, who has carefully straddled the line between science and politics as she helps lead the Trump administration’s coronavirus response, delivered a stark private warning on Monday, telling White House officials that the pandemic is entering a new and “deadly phase” that demands a more aggressive approach.

The warning, contained in a private memo to White House officials as the nation’s daily coronavirus caseload has broken records and approached 100,000, amounted to a direct contradiction of President Trump’s repeated — and inaccurate — assertions that the pandemic is “rounding the corner.”

In the memo, Dr. Birx suggested that Mr. Trump and his advisers were spending too much time focusing on preventing lockdowns and not enough time on controlling the virus.

“We are entering the most concerning and most deadly phase of this pandemic,” Dr. Birx wrote, adding: “This is not about lockdowns — it hasn’t been about lockdowns since March or April. It’s about an aggressive balanced approach that is not being implemented.”

The memo’s existence was reported earlier by The Washington Post. A top White House official who has seen it confirmed its contents.

The blunt message was a striking one for Dr. Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, who at least in public has taken care not to criticize the president or his administration. Her sharp critique reflects a growing concern among government scientists and public health experts that the worst of the pandemic is yet to come.

Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, has also been offering unusually blunt assessments, and is once again in Mr. Trump’s cross-hairs as a result. At a campaign rally early Monday morning in Miami, the president attacked the news media for its emphasis on the virus, which prompted the crowd to chant: “Fire Fauci! Fire Fauci!”

To that, Mr. Trump responded: “Don’t tell anybody, but let me wait until a little bit after the election. I appreciate the advice.” Dr. Fauci has Civil Service protections, and it would be extremely difficult for the president to remove him, though Mr. Trump recently signed an executive order in an attempt to give himself more leeway to fire federal workers.

Dr. Birx, a respected AIDS researcher, was named the coronavirus response coordinator in March. The job has required her to manage the work of the White House coronavirus task force, tracking and orchestrating the government’s effort to contain the outbreak. In the early days of the pandemic, she projected a calm, authoritative presence — and a steady counterpoint to the mixed messages from Mr. Trump.

But her tendency to remain silent as the president spread misinformation has hurt her reputation, and some of her old allies in the AIDS advocacy world have turned against her, saying openly that she has lost credibility in their eyes. More recently, she has been eclipsed by Dr. Scott W. Atlas, Mr. Trump’s new pandemic adviser.

Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci have both clashed with Dr. Atlas, who is not an epidemiologist and has called for the government to pursue a policy of allowing the virus to spread naturally among young people, while focusing efforts on protecting the elderly and vulnerable.

As Dr. Atlas’s star has risen within the White House, Dr. Birx has been spending most of her time on the road, traveling to coronavirus hot spots around the country and preaching the public health gospel of social distancing and wearing masks.

During a visit last week to North Dakota, she upbraided residents for being lax about covering their faces.

“Over the last 24 hours, as we were here and we were in your grocery stores and in your restaurants and frankly even in your hotels, this is the least use of masks that we have seen in retail establishments of any place we have been,” she told reporters during the visit, according to The Bismarck Tribune.

"Graham and Harrison Battle Over the ‘New South,’ in Their Final Appeals","[Follow our live Trump vs Biden 2020 election updates and analysis.]

CHARLESTON, S.C. — Senator Lindsey Graham’s comments that Black people can succeed without limits in South Carolina if they are conservative and that young women can excel if they follow a “traditional family structure” have framed the final arguments of the costly Senate campaign here.

Mr. Graham, a Republican seeking his fourth Senate term, has sped across South Carolina on a bus tour, imploring voters not to be tricked into abandoning him. Jaime Harrison, his Democratic opponent, has called the veteran senator a relic and is dominating the airwaves, powered by record-shattering fund-raising.

To Mr. Harrison, Mr. Graham’s comments on Black South Carolinians and women encapsulate what he has framed as competing visions of the South, one that looks backward and another embracing a diverse, inclusive future.

“I think he is a relic of 1950,” Mr. Harrison said of Mr. Graham, who has led the race by modest margins in some polls.

The incumbent appeared to embrace the role in which Mr. Harrison had cast him, pledging to defend South Carolina’s status quo.

“We’re not going to let our life and our way of life go away Tuesday, and that’s what’s on the ballot,” Mr. Graham told supporters at one of his weekend rallies, inspiring some in the crowd to raise campaign signs overhead, face masks dangling from some of their wrists.

With control of the Senate at stake, every competitive Senate race has taken on heightened importance. Republicans now hold a three-seat Senate majority, but the party is expected to lose at least two of those seats, while the Democrats are anticipated to lose one. Democrats from across the country have flooded South Carolina with money, motivated by Mr. Graham’s staunch support of President Trump and his stewardship of Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s lightning-fast confirmation to the Supreme Court as Judiciary Committee chairman.

But the same factors that have mobilized the nation’s Democrats to oppose Mr. Graham have been used by Mr. Graham to rally support in South Carolina, where Mr. Trump remains popular and Justice Barrett’s confirmation has been celebrated.

The Senate candidates’ dueling visions for South Carolina mirrored their views on the state of the nation. Mr. Graham echoed the president’s broad assurances that the coronavirus would come under control without further lockdowns, hailing Mr. Trump’s first term as a success and encouraging people to “imagine four more years” of the president’s policies and judicial picks.

Mr. Harrison and his allies invoked surging cases of the virus, struggling businesses, mounting unemployment, and what Representative James E. Clyburn, the dean of South Carolina’s Democrats, called the Trump administration’s commitment to “turning the clock back on the progress this nation has made.”

Even as Mr. Graham aligned himself closely with the president in his final pitch to voters, he acknowledged that he had been among his most vocal critics during the 2016 Republican presidential primaries.

“There’s a lot of drama, and some of it’s self-inflicted,” he said of Mr. Trump. “But when you back up, he’s done a great job for the conservative cause.”

Mr. Graham and his allies have made his work on the Judiciary Committee central to his appeal for re-election, turning the names of the Supreme Court’s two newest members, Justices Barrett and Brett M. Kavanaugh, into their loudest battle cry.

“Lindsey Graham, with the Supreme Court nominations, has shown himself to be a big leader. If we don’t get him back in, it’s going to be a serious problem,” said Mike Bales of Hanahan, S.C., who attended a rally with his wife Catherine and their young son. “Our freedoms and our way of life is at stake.”

As Lin Bennett, a Republican state representative, warmed up the crowd before the senator stepped off the bus in Charleston, she made a similar pitch. “I know some of y’all have been disappointed with him, but he has done a great job — look at the judges that he’s putting on the courts,” Ms. Bennett said.

Stumping for Mr. Harrison over the weekend, Mr. Clyburn said the Republican Senate had “aided and abetted” the president in neglecting the welfare of Americans because it had been “more preoccupied” with confirming judges as fast as possible.

“They have been confirming them to lifetime appointments just because they can,” he said. “Rather than be concerned about everyday people’s lives, they are concerned about an ideology.”

Mr. Harrison, a mentee of Mr. Clyburn’s who first reached out to the congressman when he was in high school, tried to keep the focus closer to home.

“It’s so funny that he wants to make the judiciary an issue,” he said of Mr. Graham. “Why doesn’t he make getting the Charleston loophole bill an issue?” referring to gun-control legislation drafted to close a loophole that allowed a white supremacist with a criminal record to buy a handgun that he used to slaughter Black parishioners at Charleston’s storied Mother Emanuel A.M.E. Church in 2015.

Pressed on Mr. Trump’s record of judicial appointments, Mr. Harrison did not say whether he would have supported the confirmations of Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Barrett.

In a race in which a staggering amount of money has been spent, each camp’s 11th-hour pitch sought to paint the other as beholden to special interests: Mr. Harrison’s supporters waved “For Sale” signs with Mr. Graham’s name at a drive-in rally in North Charleston on Sunday; Mr. Graham called Mr. Harrison the favored candidate of “New York and California,” arguing that even if his opponent opposed defunding the police, some of his donors might not.

Supporters at each man’s rallies said they were confident about their candidate’s chances.

“South Carolina is red to the roots,” said Beverly Owensby, a past president of the South Carolina Federation of Republican Women, who said she had traveled to Washington to support Justice Barrett’s nomination this fall.

Carlette Geddis, who attended one of Mr. Harrison’s events in Hollywood, S.C., said, “I feel, with Jaime, we have someone who can win this election and make a difference.” She was decked out in the colors of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the historically Black sorority to which Senator Kamala Harris also belonged. “He’s homegrown, just like Lindsey is, but I’m looking at the issues, and what Jaime’s talking about is what I like for my country.”

Some Democrats expressed concern about a protracted vote-counting process or potential voter suppression in South Carolina, a state that requires government-issued photo identification to vote. Mr. Harrison said Sunday that his campaign had a team of lawyers standing by.

“We know the tricks of the trade that the other side are going to try to do in order to save this race,” he said.

Mr. Graham was just ready for the advertising blitz against him to end.

“Don’t you miss car commercials?” he asked. “I can’t wait to see a car commercial.”"

Switch to Trump’s 2020






By Thomas Kaplan

Joseph R. Biden Jr. began his 2020 presidential campaign by losing, and then losing some more. But after an extraordinary comeback, he claimed the prize that had eluded him in two previous presidential campaigns: the Democratic nomination.

In the capstone of a career that has included two terms as vice president and 36 years in the Senate, Mr. Biden is now facing President Trump in a contest dominated by a global pandemic and a summer of unrest over police killings of Black Americans.

Mr. Biden’s year got off to a rocky start. In February, Iowans dealt him his first setback with a fourth-place finish in the state’s caucuses, and New Hampshire’s primary a week later went even worse. He finished in fifth place — and fled the state before the results came in.

The former vice president and his team hoped his fortunes would improve when more diverse states began holding their contests. Nevada came next, and Mr. Biden finished a distant second behind Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

Then came South Carolina. It was the first early contest where a large number of Black voters would register their preferences, and Mr. Biden enjoyed good will with those voters, stemming from his loyal service at the side of President Barack Obama. He also won the coveted endorsement of the state’s most influential Democrat, Representative James E. Clyburn.

When the results came in, he had won — and he had done so decisively, with more than twice as many votes as his closest rival, Mr. Sanders.

Over the next 48 hours, Mr. Biden got a big boost from his former competitors. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., both endorsed him, and so did former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas.

On Super Tuesday, Mr. Biden won 10 of 14 states, including some that he never campaigned in. His former rivals continued to coalesce around him over the next week. Senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey endorsed Mr. Biden before Michigan’s primary a week later.

On March 10, Mr. Biden traveled to Ohio, whose primary was scheduled for a week later. He was supposed to hold a rally in Cleveland, but the coronavirus pandemic was about to grip the nation and shut down the campaign trail. Mr. Biden’s rally was canceled.

There would not be more rallies any time soon. The pandemic effectively shut down the race between Mr. Biden and his remaining rival, Mr. Sanders, who dropped out in April.

Stuck at home in Delaware, Mr. Biden adapted to campaigning virtually — though not without some technical glitches. His campaign built a makeshift television studio in the basement of his home, allowing him to hold virtual events and give interviews as the pandemic raged.

Mr. Biden re-emerged on Memorial Day, placing a wreath at a veterans memorial in Wilmington, Del., and wearing a mask, in contrast to how Mr. Trump had been appearing. The next week, he met with community leaders at a Black church in Wilmington following the death of George Floyd in police custody.

Mr. Biden eased back into campaigning — at a distance.

His campaign organized occasional in-person events in Delaware and neighboring Pennsylvania that were designed with safety in mind, with large white circles on the ground ensuring social distancing among reporters who attended.

Mr. Biden once described himself as a “bridge” to a new generation of leaders, and he pledged to choose a woman as his running mate. After months of suspense, he selected Ms. Harris, a former rival, to join the Democratic ticket.

Ms. Harris had once eviscerated Mr. Biden on a debate stage, but their rollout went smoothly. She spoke about working with Mr. Biden’s late son Beau Biden when they were state attorneys general, and the new ticket avoided getting tripped up by their past differences.

The pandemic derailed plans for the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee and forced most of the proceedings online.

Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris accepted their nominations in front of socially distanced reporters at an event center in Wilmington — a far cry from the packed arena that was supposed to have cheered them on. On the convention’s final night, supporters gathered in their cars as if at a drive-in theater, and the new Democratic ticket joined them for a fireworks display.

Amid concerns from some Democrats about his visibility, Mr. Biden began to step up his campaigning around Labor Day, venturing to battleground states beyond the Mid-Atlantic Region. Once again, his campaign held carefully arranged events with social distancing and mask wearing, a stark contrast to Mr. Trump’s crowded rallies.

Mr. Biden was returning from a campaign trip to Minnesota when the news broke: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had died. Mr. Trump and Senate Republicans moved quickly to appoint Judge Amy Coney Barrett in her place.

Mr. Biden tried to frame the court fight as a battle over the future of health care in America, warning about Mr. Trump’s desire for the Supreme Court to strike down the Affordable Care Act.

The first debate was the subject of great anticipation, presenting Mr. Trump with a chance to change a race that was unfolding in Mr. Biden’s favor. It also put a spotlight on Mr. Biden after Mr. Trump had spent months portraying him as a senile old man.

The meeting, however, was remembered not for Mr. Biden’s performance but for Mr. Trump’s constant interruptions. Voters were left with a headache-inducing spectacle filled with attacks and light on substance.

Later that week came another seismic development: Mr. Trump tested positive for the coronavirus. Within two weeks, he had recovered and returned to the campaign trail with large rallies that flouted public health guidance.

Mr. Biden stuck to his approach. He made more visits to battleground states but refrained from holding crowded events.

In the final weeks, Mr. Biden pioneered a pandemic-appropriate substitute for traditional events: drive-in campaign rallies.

His speeches quickly took on a new soundtrack, with applause lines punctuated by the beeping of car horns.

On the last weekend before Election Day, Mr. Biden campaigned with former President Barack Obama in Michigan, a state their ticket won twice. With coronavirus cases surging in many places, they condemned Mr. Trump over his handling of the pandemic.

Mr. Biden finished the campaign much the way he had started, presenting himself as a unifying figure who would work to repair the damage inflicted by Mr. Trump’s presidency."
Some Regions Still Experience Slow Delivery of Mail Ballots,"WASHINGTON — The Postal Service has continued to struggle in the days before the election to meet its standards for on-time delivery of mail ballots despite court orders intended to speed its operations.

The percentage of ballots delivered to election officials nationwide in one to three days has hovered in the low to mid-90s in the past week. But portions of swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan have seen significantly lower rates in the closing days of the campaign, leaving some voting rights groups concerned about ballots being mailed in time to be counted.

According to an estimate by the United States Elections Project, about 29.6 million mail-in ballots are still outstanding, although it is not clear how many of those were never sent back or reflected decisions by voters to cast their ballots in person.

Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of United States District Court for the District of Columbia ordered on Sunday evening that the Postal Service again emphasize to its work force the need for “extraordinary measures” to ensure that every possible ballot was delivered by the cutoff time on Election Day, or Monday in Louisiana.

Judge Sullivan instructed the agency to clear and process all local ballots for delivery to election officials by no later than the next morning until at least Saturday. The agency must also use its Express Mail network to expedite certain ballots.

Pennsylvania, whose electoral votes could clinch a victory for either candidate, has experienced some of the most significant mail delays in the delivery of ballots. In the district covering the center of the state, daily on-time ballot delivery rates over the past 10 days have ranged from 83.28 percent to as low as 56.21 percent. The Philadelphia metropolitan area has seen better on-time delivery rates during the same period — between 78.01 and 96.7 percent — along with the Western Pennsylvania district.

The Postal Service has blamed the effects of the coronavirus and a lack of available employees for service issues in Central Pennsylvania. In a court filing on Sunday, the agency said it was moving employees to its processing plant, maximizing overtime and hiring new employees to address concerns about mail ballots.

Figures show problems in Michigan as well. Over the past week, Detroit has seen its on-time rates vary from below 50 percent to 80 percent.

In the Greater Michigan district, covering the rest of the state, the rate varied from 55 percent to 96 percent. However, in that district — as in others around the country, like in North Carolina — the Postal Service said in court documents that the figures did not include ballots that were processed in local post offices and “delivered the same day with a near 100 percent success rate.”

The agency has also argued that daily delivery rates submitted to the courts do not accurately reflect performance, as the scores fluctuate based on day and mail volume. However, a Postal Service spokesman said he could not provide weekly figures by region.

The Postal Service has blamed the pandemic and labor shortages for some of the poor rates. As coronavirus cases surge across the country, the Detroit district reported just 78 percent of its employees were available to work, while Central Pennsylvania reported 84 percent, according to a court filing on Friday.

“This has been one of the things that I’ve been really worried about this year,” said Tammy Patrick, a former Arizona elections administrator and a senior adviser at Democracy Fund, a research and advocacy group. “When you get closer and closer to Election Day, your options tend to run out.”

Keith Combs, the president of the Detroit chapter of the American Postal Workers Union, said the post office was still recovering from operational cutbacks imposed this summer by Louis DeJoy, the postmaster general, while it continued to deal with a shortage of employees.

Backups in mail delivery were better than they once were, but customers were still experiencing delays, Mr. Combs said. The Postal Service has been careful to try to shield ballots from the slowdowns, but some might slip through the cracks, he added.

Michigan and Pennsylvania are far from the only places to report problems. Lakeland, the Postal Service district that covers most of Wisconsin and Northern Illinois, has consistently fallen below the national average, along with Atlanta. The Gulf Atlantic district, which includes parts of Georgia and Florida, has also performed below the national average most days this week.

Other swing states have not experienced delays that are as widespread. Certain postal districts in Florida, including Suncoast and South Florida, have mostly had ballot delivery to election officials at rates above 90 percent this week. With the exception of Friday and Saturday, the rate of on-time mail delivery in Arizona has stayed above 97 percent."
November Surprise: Fewer Ballots Rejected by Election Officials,"[Follow our live Trump vs Biden 2020 election updates and analysis.]

WASHINGTON — With absentee ballots flooding election offices nationwide, the officials processing them are tentatively reporting some surprising news: The share of ballots being rejected because of flawed signatures and other errors appears lower — sometimes much lower — than in the past.

Should that trend hold, it could prove significant in an election in which the bulk of absentee voters has been Democratic, and Republicans have fought furiously, in court and on the stump, to discard mail ballots as fraudulent.

In Fulton County, Ga., home to Atlanta, just 278 of the first 60,000-odd ballots processed had been held back. In Minneapolis, Hennepin County officials last week had rejected only 2,080 of 325,000 ballots — and sent replacement ballots to all of those voters. In Burlington, Iowa, the number of rejected ballots on Monday was 28 of 12,310. And of 474,000 absentee ballots received in Kentucky, barely 1,300 rejects remain uncorrected by voters, compared to more than 15,000 during the state’s presidential primary in June.

The number of rejections could fall further. In those jurisdictions and many others, voters are notified of errors on ballots and can correct their mistakes, or vote in person instead.

There is no shortage of caveats to those and other upbeat reports from state and local election officials, which are far from comprehensive. In some states, including battlegrounds like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, regulations prevent early processing of millions of mail ballots, and it is impossible to know how many will be turned down.

Postal Service delays mean some — perhaps many — ballots will arrive in election offices too late to be counted. In at least a few states, including Florida and North Carolina, absentee ballots cast by people of color and young people are being rejected at rates far higher than the average. And even a low rejection rate can have enormous import, given the torrent of absentee votes cast this year.

Still, some experts on election administration say they are heartened by the reports they have received to date. About 319,000 mail ballots were disqualified in the 2016 general election, but according to a survey by National Public Radio, that ballooned to more than 550,000 rejections in this year’s primary elections, as voters new to absentee ballots stumbled over their often-confusing requirements.

Many experts feared that rejection rates would mushroom even more as mail voting reached new highs this fall. Instead, it appears that many voters have risen to the challenge.

“Historically, you’ve seen about 1 percent of ballots get bounced for one reason or another, mostly because of lateness,” said Nate Persily, a Stanford University professor of law and an expert on election administration. “But people are more attuned to the deadline this year, and voters are more aware of the criteria for casting absentee ballots.

“You’re going to have 80 million absentee ballots cast, and hundreds of thousands may have problems. But 99 percent or more of them will count.”

Should the early indications prove true, there will be no single explanation for the low number of rejections. As election officials tell it, a confluence of changes has made it easier for people to vote by mail since last spring, when many states were unprepared for the wave of mail ballots cast by people fearful of voting in person during a pandemic.

For one thing, some states have rolled back confusing requirements. Minnesota no longer requires that absentee ballots be witnessed, acceding to a court ruling that the mandate was not justified during a pandemic. In Kentucky, technological advances that have made it possible to track mail ballots enabled state officials to relax longstanding provisions, such as the requirement for multiple signatures, that were a major cause of past rejections.

“We’ve added so many layers of security to the system that redundancies built in in the ’60s and ’70s, we don’t need any more,” Jared Dearing, the director of the Kentucky Elections Commissions, said last week. Even those voters whose ballots are rejected, he said, are automatically notified by email within an hour.

Election officials also say many voters appear more motivated to cast ballots this year, and more attentive to instructions on mail voting that have flooded newspapers, television and the internet. Changes in the design of ballots also have been a factor: On the advice of experts, for example, election officials in Rochester Hills, Mich., made the spot on ballots where voters are supposed to enter contact information easier to find. More are now doing that, making it easier to notify voters of problems with their ballots.

It is not only voters who are more aware of the potential pitfalls in voting by mail. Voting officials also have come to recognize that a high rejection rate could have real-world consequences in a close election.

“Jurisdictions are now very sensitive to the reasons for disqualifying absentee ballots,” Dr. Persily said. “When they were processing very few of them, those reasons might not have appeared significant. But now that cavalier enforcement of the rules led to tens of thousands of ballots being disqualified, they’re more likely to provide strict and consistent application of those guidelines.”

Indeed, many election officials are going the extra mile to accommodate voters. In Nashville’s Davidson County, election workers used pink highlighters to underscore often-overlooked signature lines on the roughly 37,000 absentee ballots they have mailed to voters. As of last week, officials had flagged only 11 ballots that lacked proper signatures, said Jeff Roberts, the county elections director.

If the rate of disqualified ballots has unquestionably fallen in some jurisdictions, one leading expert on mail voting, Daniel A. Smith of the University of Florida, offers a completely different explanation as to why.

In Florida, where 1.3 percent of mail ballots were thrown out in 2018, the rejection rate on Monday was a bare 0.3 percent. But “it’s not that we’re having fewer ballots rejected,” Mr. Smith said. “It’s that we’re having a higher rate of ballots being cured” — that is, corrected and made eligible for counting.

That is especially true in battleground states like Florida and Georgia. In both states, armies of workers for political parties, candidates and advocacy groups are pelting voters whose ballots were rejected with telephone calls and emails urging them to fix their mistakes. In Florida, where some 32,000 ballots were rejected in 2018, only 14,072 had been tossed out as of Monday, two-thirds of those because signatures were missing.

“In every county, we’re having massive efforts on the ground” to fix ballot mistakes, Mr. Smith said. “And we have never seen anything like that in any previous election.”

In some other states, voters who make mistakes are simply out of luck. Only 18 states require that voters be notified if their ballot has a missing signature or a signature discrepancy, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In Texas and Alaska, state officials went to court this year to preserve their right to throw out ballots without telling voters — and won both cases.

Even the good news of fewer rejections masks persistent problems with the few ballots that are disqualified, Mr. Smith said. In Florida, ballots cast by Black voters have been rejected at twice the rate of those cast by white voters. The Latino rejection rate is still higher. And the ballots of the youngest voters, between ages 18 and 23, are being rejected at a rate more than four times that of voters over age 65.

Similar racial and ethnic disparities also are occurring in another swing state, North Carolina, the advocacy group Democracy North Carolina reported on Monday.

The current low rates are destined to rise, Mr. Smith said, when deadlines for receiving mail ballots expire and election officials reject the thousands that arrive late.

That said, some experts believe that American voters deserve a pat on the back for their performance.

“If election officials and voters are able to vote by mail in such high numbers, yet see so few ballots rejected during a pandemic, that will have been one of the great accomplishments in American democracy,” said David J. Becker, the director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research."
Can Biden Regain Lost Ground With Latinos?,"MIAMI — Despite a late push to court Latino voters over the last several weeks, Joseph R. Biden Jr. is ending his presidential bid on shaky and perhaps perilous ground with this diverse, essential segment of the electorate, according to interviews with Democratic officials, community activists and voters.

Several of the battleground states on a knife’s edge ahead of Election Day — Florida, Texas, Arizona and even Pennsylvania — have large Latino populations. If Mr. Biden loses those states, let alone the election, the Democratic Party’s post-mortem will surely include this question:

Did Mr. Biden do too little, too late to court Latino voters, committing a strategic error that could be the 2020 version of Hillary Clinton taking Wisconsin for granted in 2016?

“There’s more we could have done on our side, there is more the Biden campaign should have done, as a party we are always so late to the game,” said Lorella Praeli, president of Community Change Action, a Washington-based progressive group that has been trying to mobilize Latino voters.

“We are always leaving people on the table, we are always leaving power on the table,” she added.

Polling in battleground states this fall has generally shown Mr. Biden leading President Trump among Hispanic voters, but not in every case — and rarely by the same margin that Mrs. Clinton commanded in 2016, especially among Hispanic men.

The picture is especially dicey for Mr. Biden in Florida. Mr. Trump and his team have aggressively courted conservatives in the Cuban, Venezuelan and Colombian communities around Miami for years, hoping to offset their losses among suburbanites and seniors in the state.

His closing message — that Mr. Biden is the captive of “radicals” and “socialists” — resonates deeply in the anti-Castro Cuban community, and Mr. Trump wrapped up Saturday’s five-rally day in Opa-locka, once home to a relocation center for refugees from the island.

A New York Times/Siena College poll of Florida released on Sunday showed Mr. Biden with the support of 54 percent of the state’s Latino voters, compared with 62 percent for Mrs. Clinton four years ago. He and Mr. Trump were basically tied among Hispanic men in the state. Last week another Florida poll, from NBC News/Marist College, actually found Mr. Biden trailing among likely Latino voters, 52 to 46.

Hispanic voters in general have long shown less partisan loyalty over all than white and Black voters typically do, and they are more inclined to express ambivalence about their choices in an election.

Mr. Biden is competitive among Latino voters, and could still win Florida based on his strength with educated whites. But he would be in better shape, campaign aides privately acknowledged, if the campaign had reached out earlier to recruit infrequent voters and soften Mr. Trump’s support among Hispanic men in the state.

Even as Mr. Biden’s campaign intensified its phone-bank efforts and Spanish-language advertising in Puerto Rican communities in Florida and North Carolina over the weekend, it was clear to many involved in the effort that time had run out.

“The Biden people have done a good job in playing catch-up, but it is always the same, every cycle,” said Chuck Rocha, who runs Nuestro PAC, a pro-Biden committee that has raised $9 million for Spanish-language advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts. “Everybody only does Latino outreach in the last couple of weeks of the campaign. That has to change.”

Julián Castro, a former mayor of San Antonio whose unsuccessful run for the Democratic presidential nomination was rooted in an appeal to Latino voters, said his party “needs to do much more.”

“There needs to be a yearlong, consistent effort to turn people out, and to reach voters who are harder to get — especially in Arizona and Texas, which are so close for us now,” Mr. Castro added.

The coronavirus has also been an impediment, said Mr. Castro, the former secretary of housing and urban development under President Barack Obama and now an adviser to Mr. Biden. “Latino voters like in-person contact,” he said.

The overall problem is rooted not only in the party’s inconsistent efforts to reach Latino voters, but also in the particulars of Mr. Biden’s primary campaign. It was a cash-poor operation that was focused on Black voters, a group long courted by the former vice president that turned out to be critical to his primary victory.

Mr. Biden’s Hispanic-outreach operation, like other parts of his campaign, did not really get rolling until the summer, when his lackluster fund-raising operation turned around, and he hired Julie Chávez Rodríguez, granddaughter of the labor leader César Chávez, to oversee it.

Still, the party has seen some successes. The Democratic National Committee invested heavily in microtargeting Puerto Rican voters through the purchase of call lists in 2019, and Mr. Biden owes his surprising strength in Texas and Arizona to strong support from Latino voters.

Democratic officials say they expected that nine million Latino voters will have gone to the polls early by mail or in person, up from 3.7 million in 2016. Many of those voters are new — 500,000 of the two million Latino voters who have voted early in Texas were there for the first time, according to a person who worked on the effort.

Democrats have also recently begun pouring money and resources into outreach efforts, with donors pumping $28 million into three independent expenditure groups aimed at increasing Latino turnout in the past two months. That includes a recent influx of cash from Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, and Priorities USA, a leading pro-Biden super PAC.

Thanks to those funds, the Biden campaign has been able to increase its Spanish-language media buys in the closing weeks, with six-figure expenditures booked in Florida, Arizona and Pennsylvania, a spokesman said.

Mr. Biden has also made multiple trips to Florida, and surrogates like Mr. Castro have been crisscrossing the Sun Belt to stoke turnout. Last week the campaign dispatched Kamala Harris, his running mate, for a high-profile tour of the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, even though Mr. Biden himself has not campaigned in the state, a big prize many in his campaign still view as a reach.

But much of the Democrats’ resources in the closing days is being devoted to providing basic voting information to registered Latino voters, rather than funding a deeper dive into the voter files to reach more voters, or a big effort to change the minds of wavering male voters, party officials said.

“In our field conversations we’re making sure they have all the information they need to follow through on their voting plan,” said Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee.

As Election Day drew near, the party and campaign officials converged on a single message: steering voters to voyavotar.com, a web portal with polling place information in Spanish.

The effort has been especially intense in Arizona and along Florida’s Interstate-4 corridor, which crosses the middle of the state. The campaign has also boosted its efforts in parts of Pennsylvania, where dozens of volunteers canvassed voter lists to target Puerto Ricans who have recently moved to the state, a small but potentially significant pool of votes in the critical battleground.

The work is labor intensive.

On Saturday, Veronica Escobar, the Democratic congresswoman from El Paso, spent 20 minutes on the phone with a young Mexican-American woman in Texas who was outraged at Mr. Trump’s response to the pandemic and frightened by his rhetoric — and had no intention, whatsoever, of voting.

It often takes a lot of effort to persuade such voters, but the key for Ms. Escobar was offering the 24-year-old woman, who had registered at 18 but never voted, detailed step-by-step instructions on how to cast a ballot for Mr. Biden.

“When I was done, she said to me, ‘Thank you for doing this, I’ve wanted to vote for a long time, but was I too embarrassed to ask somebody how to do it,’” recalled Ms. Escobar, who helped fund part of a last-minute, $50,000 phone-bank effort to reach Latino voters on behalf of Mr. Biden and other Democrats, out of her own campaign coffers.

Still, Mr. Biden faces significant challenges if he wants to match or improve on Mrs. Clinton’s numbers among Latino voters.

In Florida, Mr. Biden needs non-Cuban Hispanics, such as Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Dominicans and others, to grow his support among the state’s Latino voters. Many of those voters, however, live in Miami-Dade County and have not cast ballots at the same rate as Republican-leaning Cubans.

About 45 percent of Puerto Rican voters had cast ballots in Miami-Dade as of Saturday, according to an analysis by Hawkfish, a Democratic technology and data firm, compared with 58 percent of other Hispanic voters and 62 percent of Cuban-American voters. Mr. Trump has made inroads especially with newer Cuban immigrants.

Democrats are relying on many Latino voters to go to the polls on Election Day, as they have tended to do in the past.

“That’s the thing with Miami: It’s hard to predict, because people decide late,” said State Senator José Javier Rodríguez, a Democrat from Miami, who is Cuban-American.

On Sunday, Mr. Trump held a midnight rally at the Opa-locka airport, near the Cuban-American enclaves of Hialeah and Miami Lakes. The warm-up acts featured a performance by the Cuban trio Los 3 de La Habana, whose song “Canción de Trump” has become ubiquitous in Miami and made it into a Spanish-language ad that Mr. Trump’s campaign has put atop its YouTube page.

Cary Hidalgo, 57, called the election a choice between “the lesser of two evils, same as last election,” in which she voted for Mr. Trump.

This year, she again voted for him. “He’s not a politician. He’s uncouth. He has no tact,” Ms. Hidalgo, a financial-aid officer at a vocational school, said of Mr. Trump.

“But I don’t like the fact that I feel Biden and the Democrat Party at this point is leaning toward socialistic views. I don’t agree with that,” said Ms. Hidalgo, who is Cuban-American. “That’s what my father left his country for.”"
"Undeterred by Pandemic, Americans Prepare to Deliver Verdict on Trump","[These are the key states President-elect Joe Biden won.]

NEW HOPE, Pa. — Voters on both sides of the nation’s widening political divide prepared on Monday to render a verdict on President Trump’s four tumultuous years in the White House and, in particular, his management of the coronavirus pandemic that has upended American life for the past eight months.

As Mr. Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. raced across the most important battleground states in a frenzied final push for votes, the 2020 election was unfolding in a country with urgent problems: an uncontrolled public health crisis, a battered economy, deep ideological divisions, a national reckoning on race and uncertainty about whether the outcome of the vote will be disputed.

Undeterred by the pandemic, Americans have already displayed an uncommon determination to have their voices and votes heard this year. Nearly 100 million cast their ballots in advance of Election Day, shattering records as they endured long lines at early voting sites or sent in their ballots by mail.

Much of the country felt on edge, as if the often-predicted “most important election of a lifetime” had finally arrived. Ahead of the polls opening on Tuesday, businesses in cities from Denver to Detroit to Washington, D.C., were boarding up their windows with plywood as they readied for the possibility of civil unrest. Some governors were readying the National Guard.

“Everyone is starting to panic,” Fernando Casas, a construction worker, said as he pounded nails into a plywood frame at a storefront in a trendy shopping district near Los Angeles.

Election administrators braced themselves to pull off the twin challenges of holding an election during a pandemic and fending off efforts by a president who is trailing in the polls to undermine trust in the vote-counting process.

“Please be patient,” Jim Kenney, the mayor of Philadelphia — the biggest city in one of the most important swing states — urged, predicting long lines on Tuesday. Both the Trump and Biden campaigns were readying armies of lawyers for a potentially prolonged fight.

Still, the unchecked spread of Covid-19 shadowed the election, and on Monday, a report from the coordinator of the White House virus task force contradicted the president’s repeated claims on the campaign trail that the United States was on the way to defeating the virus.

The report, by Dr. Deborah Birx, warned against the type of rallies that Mr. Trump had been holding. It also predicted that the United States would see days when the number of new cases exceeded 100,000, according to a White House official who has reviewed the report, which was first reported by The Washington Post.

Voters were racked with nervous energy. Katie Whelan, a high school history teacher from New Jersey, crossed the Pennsylvania border to knock on doors over the weekend for Mr. Biden in the key battleground. The previous night, she said, she had awakened from a panic dream involving Hillary Clinton and the dread of falling just short at the ballot box. “She was like, ‘Honey, I’ve been there,’” Ms. Whelan recalled Mrs. Clinton telling her in the dream.

Adding to her anxiety, Ms. Whelan could not tell if the nightmare was set in 2016 or 2020. “I stood over the sink and drank three pints of water,” Ms. Whelan said. “And I said to myself, ‘I better get canvassing.’”

For Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden, their final events on the last full day of 2020 campaigning offered as stark a display of their differences as anything they said.

Seeking to project a sense of normalcy even as infection caseloads surge, Mr. Trump flouted public health guidelines with a slate of large rallies in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, and even made a winking nod to firing the country’s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, should he win another term, in a Florida rally that lasted past midnight on Sunday.

In Ohio and Pennsylvania, Mr. Biden argued there could be no return to routine until the virus was under control and his itinerary of socially distanced, drive-in rallies — “Honk if you agree with me!” he shouted in Cleveland — served a visual expression of his sober approach. Mr. Biden, the former vice president, cast race as a referendum on Mr. Trump’s stewardship of a pandemic that has infected more than nine million people in the United States and cost more than 230,000 lives.

“The first step to beating the virus is beating Donald Trump,” Mr. Biden declared, adding, “The power to change the country is in your hands.”

In his own meandering and grievance-filled appearances, in which he lashed out against Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, Hillary Clinton and the news media, Mr. Trump framed his re-election as an economic imperative to avoid “a deadly Biden lockdown” of the economy’s fragile recovery.

“This is not the crowd of a second-place finisher,” Mr. Trump said in Scranton, Pa., where Mr. Biden will also appear on Election Day, in a sign of Pennsylvania’s potential to tip the election.

Mr. Trump has signaled he may try to declare victory prematurely if the early tabulations favor him, and the Biden campaign held an unusual public briefing on the eve of the election to set expectations. At issue is not just the tallying of the vote but how fast certain states can count. Some key battlegrounds, such as Pennsylvania, are expected to take days while others, like Florida and North Carolina, will likely process most votes within hours.

“Under no scenario will Donald Trump be declared a victor on election night,” Jen O’Malley Dillon, Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, bluntly declared.

As polling places were set to open on Election Day, Mr. Trump’s road back to the White House was plainly narrower than Mr. Biden’s pathway. Polls show Mr. Trump trailing nationally and in most of the key battlegrounds needed to reach the 270 electoral votes required to win the presidency.

Mr. Trump has been forced to defend not just the three Northern industrial states — the former “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan — that he flipped in a surprise victory four years ago but also an array of diversifying states across the Sun Belt and the South, including Florida, Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia and even Texas.

Those latter five states combine for 109 Electoral College votes, nearly all of which analysts believe Mr. Trump must win.

On Monday, Mr. Biden dispatched his most potent surrogate, former President Barack Obama, to two of those states: Florida and Georgia. The former president campaigned for Mr. Biden and two Senate Democratic challengers in Georgia, then stumped for Mr. Biden in Florida. Democratic Party strategists are hoping to win the three Senate seats they need to wrest back control of that chamber, along with the White House, and enact a progressive agenda in 2021.

The widening map had some Democrats coveting not only victory on Tuesday but also a landslide repudiation of Mr. Trump and his brand of Republicanism, including aspirations of flipping Texas for the first time since 1976. 

That Mr. Biden himself began his final full day on the road in Ohio — a state Mr. Trump carried by eight percentage points — appeared a sign his campaign hoped to run up the score. Ohio was not among the dozen closest states in 2016.

But voters in both parties are mistrustful of the polls. Mr. Trump has actively questioned them on a near daily basis. And many Democrats are still scarred by the shock of 2016.

Outside the Polk County Auditor’s office in Des Moines, the line to vote early stretched around the block. For 18-year-old Mikayla Simpson, who stood in line wearing earbuds and a tan camouflage Trump 2020 baseball cap, the wait to cast her first vote for Mr. Trump was well worth it.

“I’d stand here all day if I had to,” she said.

Turnout on Tuesday will be critical even with the record early voting.

Mr. Trump, who for months has sown mistrust in mail-in ballots, is especially in need of a huge in-person showing, banking that the Republican Party’s early investment in door-knocking will pay off.

Mr. Trump’s chances are mostly pinned on luring white working class voters to the polls — many of whom have flocked to his rallies despite the health risks. Seeking to recapture the energy of his surprise 2016 win, Mr. Trump’s final stop is expected to be in Grand Rapids, Mich., the same city he finished his 2016 schedule.

The Democratic ticket ended the day in Pennsylvania’s two biggest media markets alongside pop stars at rallies in stadium parking lots, with Ms. Harris in Philadelphia with John Legend and Mr. Biden in Pittsburgh with Lady Gaga. Lady Gaga also performed at Mrs. Clinton’s final 2016 rally, then in North Carolina.

“Vote like this country depends on it because it does,” she said Monday.

In the final stretch, both parties were zeroing in on key demographics. Mr. Biden spoke with the African-American community in Pittsburgh while his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, headlined a Latino get-out-the-vote effort in Bethlehem. Mr. Obama campaigned in Miami-Dade County, Florida’s most populous which is a majority Latino and Black.

Mr. Trump continued to obsess aloud about how white suburban women had flocked toward the Democratic Party during his presidency, helping to deliver Democrats the House in 2018 and possibly the White House in 2020.

“I say to the women of the suburbs: love me women of the suburbs,” Mr. Trump said.

For Mr. Tump, the race’s waning days have been a characteristically chaotic closing stretch. He has threatened to send in lawyers to stop vote counting, cheered on supporters who surrounded a Biden bus on a Texas highway and baselessly accused doctors of exaggerating how many people had died from the virus so that they could make more money.

In Fayetteville, N.C., on Monday, Mr. Trump condemned the Supreme Court decision that will allow ballots to be counted in Pennsylvania after Election Day. “Do you know what can happen during that long period of time?” Mr. Trump said without evidence. “Cheating.”

Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump’s closing messages captured their divergent approaches to electoral politics.

“There will be no red states and blue states, just the United States,” Mr. Biden said of his potential presidency. 

Mr. Trump had a very different pitch. “You have the power to vote, so go out and vote,” he said. “Unless you’re going to vote for somebody other than me, in which case, sit it out.”

President Trump’s 2020,"January 2020 President Trump began the year fighting an impeachment trial.

Switch to Biden’s 2020






By Annie Karni

This was not the 2020 that President Trump had envisioned for himself.

The year began with Mr. Trump embroiled in a monthslong impeachment proceeding, which scrutinized his pressure campaign on the president of Ukraine to investigate his political rivals at home. That was, in retrospect, the easy part of the year.

From the Democratic primary race emerged perhaps the trickiest opponent for him — Joseph R. Biden Jr., a centrist with moderate appeal. A pandemic killed more than 230,000 people in the United States and devastated the economic gains that were to serve as his main argument for re-election.

But Mr. Trump was already holding rage-filled campaign rallies in January, warning that Democrats’ efforts to remove him from office were designed to “nullify the ballots of tens of millions of patriotic Americans.”

Assured acquittal by the Republican-led Senate, Mr. Trump used his State of the Union address to make the case for a second term. The most memorable moment of the evening was delivered by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who ostentatiously ripped up her copy of the president’s speech at its conclusion. And Republican lawmakers’ cheers of “Four more years!” made it clear that both parties were interested in creating a partisan spectacle.

The Senate, divided almost entirely along party lines, acquitted Mr. Trump of charges that he abused his power and obstructed Congress to aid his own re-election. The president hailed it as a victory, calling the entire impeachment “corrupt.” 

He returned to the campaign trail, often visiting states where Democrats were holding primary contests.

Mr. Trump downplayed the risks of the coronavirus as it began to take hold in February. In an Oval Office address in March, he struggled to acknowledge the deepening crisis while continuing to diminish its threat to the country’s future. He described it ominously as a “foreign virus,” blaming China and Europe. 

The coronavirus task force briefings were originally led by Vice President Mike Pence. But Mr. Trump quickly took over, turning them into daily aggressive defenses of his own response to the pandemic. He was persuaded to halt the briefings after seeing a drop in his poll numbers, but the pause would only be temporary

In April, Mr. Trump tweeted “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” and “LIBERATE MINNESOTA!” — encouraging his supporters to protest coronavirus restrictions imposed by Democratic governors. His appeal to his base furthered partisan divisions on the pandemic response.

After George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, was killed in the custody of the Minneapolis police, protests against racial injustice spread throughout the country. A chemical spray and rubber bullets were used to clear peaceful protesters from Lafayette Park, in front of the White House, so that Mr. Trump could stage a photo op at a nearby church that had been vandalized days before. 

The Trump campaign hyped a June rally in Tulsa, Okla., as the president’s triumphant return to the stump. Though the campaign claimed that nearly one million people had registered for tickets, Mr. Trump spoke in front of a mostly empty arena. It was a sign that even his own supporters were frightened of the coronavirus, despite his repeated attempts to dismiss it. 

Standing in front of Mount Rushmore just before the Fourth of July, Mr. Trump used an official presidential address to wage a culture war against a straw-man version of the left that he portrayed as inciting mayhem and moving the country toward totalitarianism.

He tried to position himself as the candidate of law and order, claiming that “angry mobs” wanted to tear down statues of the nation’s founders and “unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities.”

The first coronavirus outbreak in the spring hit hard in Northeastern cities and spots on the West Coast, but a second surge in the summer spread across a wider portion of the country. Hospitals fought to contain the surge.

After moving the location of the Republican National Convention twice, Mr. Trump eventually decided to deliver his renomination speech from the South Lawn of the White House in August.

His campaign maintained that holding the premier political event of the presidential race on government property was not a violation of the Hatch Act. But the event symbolized a final demolition of the boundary between governing and campaigning that the president had been eroding for years.

The day after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died in September, Mr. Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, were already in contact with Judge Amy Coney Barrett about filling the opening on the Supreme Court. Two days later, they offered her the nomination.

Mr. Trump hosted Judge Barrett, her family and Republican lawmakers at the White House for a formal announcement ceremony the next weekend. There was no social distancing and few wore masks.

Mr. Trump spent the first presidential debate interrupting Mr. Biden nearly every time he spoke. The debate devolved into an ugly brawl that polls showed hurt the president.

Less than 48 hours after the debate, Mr. Trump announced on Twitter that he and the first lady, Melania Trump, had tested positive for the coronavirus. He was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he remained for three days. The White House physician, Dr. Sean P. Conley, delivered confusion and obfuscation with his updates on the president’s condition.

Upon his return to the White House, Mr. Trump was unrepentant about his efforts to play down the virus. “Don’t let it dominate your lives,” he urged Americans.

Mr. Trump roared back to the campaign trail after his recovery. In the final weeks of the race, as the number of coronavirus cases skyrocketed nationwide, his leading message to supporters was to trust him that the worst of the pandemic was over. He railed against the news media for continuing to cover the health crisis.

Mr. Trump’s advisers persuaded him to tone down his performance in the second and final debate. Even though he played nicer with the moderator and let Mr. Biden speak, he did little to change the trajectory of the race or to toggle the focus away from his handling of the pandemic.

Eight days before the election, Mr. Trump won confirmation of his third Supreme Court justice. He immediately hosted a nighttime ceremony on the White House lawn to swear in Ms. Barrett. The outdoor gathering was a mirror image of the potential superspreader event he held a month earlier to announce her nomination.

In the closing days of the campaign, Mr. Trump barnstormed the country as if the virus that defined much of his year did not exist. His lagging position in the polls was evident in his grueling travel schedule, which had him seeking to shore up votes in states that he won in 2016, with up to five stops a day.

Instead of focusing his closing argument on the economy, he accused doctors of fabricating coronavirus cases in order to make money, complained about the bitter cold in states like Michigan, and hinted he wanted to fire Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert. His last stop before Election Day was Michigan, a repeat of his travel schedule four years ago."
The Electoral College Explained,"It remains one of the most surprising facts about voting in the United States: While the popular vote elects members of Congress, mayors, governors, state legislators and even more obscure local officials, it does not determine the winner of the presidency, the highest office in the land.

That important decision ultimately falls to the Electoral College. When Americans cast their ballots, they are actually voting for a slate of electors appointed by their state’s political parties who are pledged to support that party’s candidate. (They don’t always do so.)

This leads to an intense focus on battleground states, as candidates look to boost their electoral advantage by targeting states that can help them reach the needed 270 votes of the 538 up for grabs. The Electoral College also inspires many what-if scenarios, some of them more likely than others.

On Dec. 14, as electors gathered across the country to cast their ballots, Joseph R. Biden Jr. had earned 306 electoral votes, 36 more than needed to win. President Trump had earned 232 electoral votes. Mr. Biden was leading in the popular vote, with more than 81 million votes. More than 74 million votes had been counted for Mr. Trump.

The New York Times called the last two states on its map on Nov. 13: Georgia’s 16 electoral votes for Mr. Biden and North Carolina’s 15 for Mr. Trump.

Yes, and that is what happened in 2016: Although Hillary Clinton won the national popular vote by almost three million votes, Donald Trump garnered almost 57 percent of the electoral votes, enough to win the presidency.

The same thing happened in 2000. Although Al Gore won the popular vote, George W. Bush earned more electoral votes after a contested Florida recount and a Supreme Court decision.

And in 1888, Benjamin Harrison defeated the incumbent president, Grover Cleveland, in the Electoral College, despite losing the popular vote. Cleveland ran again four years later and won back the White House.

Other presidents who lost the popular vote but won the presidency include John Quincy Adams and Rutherford B. Hayes in the elections of 1824 and 1876.

The House of Representatives picked Adams over Andrew Jackson, who won the popular vote but only a plurality of the Electoral College. A special commission named by the House chose Hayes over Samuel J. Tilden, after 20 electoral votes in Florida, Louisiana and South Carolina were disputed.

The Electoral College has also awarded the presidency to candidates with a plurality of the popular vote (under 50 percent) in a number of cases, notably Abraham Lincoln in 1860, John F. Kennedy in 1960 and Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996.

Because there is now an even number of electoral votes, a tie is feasible. If that happens in the Electoral College, then the decision goes to the newly seated House of Representatives, with each state voting as a unit.

Although it’s not detailed in the Constitution, each state delegation would vote on which candidate to support as a group, with the plurality carrying the day, said Akhil Reed Amar, a professor of law and political science at Yale University. If there is a tie vote in a state’s delegation, the state’s vote would not count. A presidential candidate needs at least 26 votes to win.

Currently, Republicans control 26 state delegations, while Democrats control 22. Pennsylvania is tied between Republican and Democratic representatives, and Michigan has seven Democrats, six Republicans and one independent. That could change on Nov. 3 of course, because all House seats are up for election.

The decision on vice president goes to the newly elected Senate, with each senator casting a vote. Ultimately, any disputes about the procedure could land everything in the Supreme Court.

People call them “faithless electors.” In 2016, seven electors — 5 Democrats and 2 Republicans — broke their promises to vote for their party’s nominee, the most ever in history. They voted for a variety of candidates not on the ballot: Bernie Sanders, Colin Powell and Ron Paul, among others. It did not change the outcome.

Whether electors should be able to change their positions has been heavily debated, so much so that the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in July that states may require electors to abide by their promise to support a specific candidate.

Some scholars have said they do not wholeheartedly agree with the decision, arguing that it endangers an elector’s freedom to make decisions they want and that electors are usually picked for their loyalty to a candidate or party.

“They will do as promised if the candidates do a very good job vetting them and picking people who are rock-solid,” Professor Amar said.

Thirty-three states and the District of Columbia have laws that require electors to vote for their pledged candidate. Some states replace electors and cancel their votes if they break their pledge.

Certain penalties exist in other states. In New Mexico, electors can be charged with a felony if they abandon their pledge, and in Oklahoma a faithless elector could face a misdemeanor charge.

The Electoral College was born at the 1787 Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia.

The nation’s founders hoped to quell the formation of powerful factions and political parties, and they wanted a mechanism that did not rely solely on popular majorities or Congress. Despite the name, it is not a college in the modern educational sense, but refers to a collegium or group of colleagues.

The system had some unusual results from the start, as evident in the election of 1800, a tie in which Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr received an equal number of electoral votes. Congress broke the tie, and Jefferson became president and Burr became vice president. (Until the ratification of the 12th Amendment in 1804, the candidate with the second-highest number of electoral votes became vice president.)

Today, electors meet in their respective states on the first Monday after the second Wednesday of December — Dec. 14 this year — to cast separate ballots for president and vice president, with the candidates who receive a majority of votes being elected.

Electors are chosen every four years in the months leading up to Election Day by their respective state’s political parties. Processes vary from state to state, with some choosing electors during state Republican and Democratic conventions. Some states list electors’ names on the general election ballot.

The process of choosing electors can be an “insider’s game,” said Kimberly Wehle, a professor at the University of Baltimore and the author of “What You Need to Know About Voting and Why.” They are often state legislators, party leaders or donors, she said.

The important number is 270. A total of 538 electoral votes are in play across all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The total number of electoral votes assigned to each state varies depending on population, but each state has at least three, and the District of Columbia has had three electors since 1961.

Most are, and it helps to think of voting on a state-by-state basis, Professor Amar said.

“It’s just like in tennis,” he said. “It’s how many sets you win and not how many games or points you win. You have to win the set, and in our system, you have to win the state.”

Two exceptions are Maine and Nebraska, which rely on congressional districts to divvy up electoral votes. The winner of the state’s popular vote gets two electoral votes, and one vote is awarded to the winner of the popular vote in each congressional district.

There are arguments that the states with smaller populations are overrepresented in the Electoral College, because every state gets at least 3 electors regardless of population. In a stark example, sparsely populated Wyoming has three votes and a population of about 580,000, giving its individual voters far more clout in the election than their millions of counterparts in densely populated states like Florida, California and New York. And the American citizens who live in territories like Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands are not represented by any electors.

“When you talk about the Electoral College shaping the election, it shapes the election all the time because it puts the focus on certain states and not others,” said Alexander Keyssar, a professor of history and social policy at Harvard University.

For years there have been debates about abolishing the Electoral College entirely, with the 2016 election bringing the debate back to the surface. It was even a talking point among 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.

The idea has public support, but faces a partisan divide, since Republicans currently benefit from the electoral clout of less populous, rural states.

Gallup reports 61 percent of Americans support abolishing the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote. However, that support diverges widely based on political parties, with support from 89 percent of Democrats and only 23 percent of Republicans.

One route would be a constitutional amendment, which would require two-thirds approval from both the House and Senate and ratification by the states, or a constitutional convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures.

Some hope to reduce the Electoral College’s importance without an amendment. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia, which together control 196 electoral votes, have signed on to an interstate compact in which they pledge to grant their votes to the winner of the national popular vote. (Voters in one of those states, Colorado, on Nov. 3 backed membership in the compact after opponents of the measure collected enough signatures to put the law on the ballot as a referendum.) The local laws would take effect only once the compact has enough states to total 270 electoral votes.

Lastly, an election-related case could find its way to the Supreme Court, which would lend greater importance to the judicial makeup of the court, Professor Wehle said.

“It only takes five people with life tenure to actually amend this Constitution through a judicial opinion,” she said."
"Washington, On Edge About the Election, Boards Itself Up","WASHINGTON — Here is one early and unnerving election indicator: plywood.

In recent days, the ominous precaution has been evident all across downtown Washington, fanning out several blocks from the White House. Plywood has been spreading around Capitol Hill, along the nightlife corridors of 14th Street and Adams Morgan, and reaching into the suburbs. Storefronts and office buildings were being boarded up throughout the weekend and probably will be until this is all over, whenever that is.

Plywood is never a comforting sign. It suggests chaos and riots, hunkering down and hurricanes. Elections? That’s not how it is supposed to go here. Yes, the country is palpably on edge, and there have already been scattered reports of ugly episodes nationwide: polling place confrontations, peaceful demonstrators being tear-gassed in North Carolina, supporters of President Trump shutting down a New Jersey highway and reported threats of possible militia violence in Georgia.

But there is something about seeing plywood in the nation’s capital that can seem especially chilling.

Theoretically, this should be the shining city of rituals, norms and orderly traditions. A presidential election should be a time to celebrate an enduring democracy and peaceful transfer of power. But of course, this is 2020.

On Sunday, several news organizations reported that government security officials would be erecting a “non-scalable” fence around the White House complex to secure the area. About 600 National Guard troops have been designated to respond if requested by any governor around the country — or by the Army secretary in the District of Columbia — to support their response to protests, Guard officials said.

The news conjured an immediate echo to the spectacle in Lafayette Square in June, when riot officers and mounted police cleared protesters so that Mr. Trump could hold up a Bible for a photo op in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church.

Nothing about the phrase “peaceful transfer of power” feels assured this week — neither the “peaceful” nor “transfer of power” parts.

It appeared that nearly every CVS, Walgreens and 7-Eleven within at least a mile or so of downtown was being heavily fortified.

That is perhaps the most unnerving part: the idea that plywood, suddenly, feels like a normal characteristic of the local architecture at certain times. That no one would flinch upon being warned that the next several days should be treated as a possible disaster.

Students at George Washington University received emails last week saying, “We suggest preparing for the Election Day period as you would for a hurricane or a snowstorm.” Recipients were urged to stock up on food and supplies.

There have been other such advisories. New Zealand’s ambassador to Washington, Rosemary Banks, sent a note in recent weeks to embassy staff members reminding them to keep 14 days of food and essentials at home. The stockpiling has been embassy protocol since the coronavirus pandemic began, but in this note the ambassador said there was a new concern: the prospect that violent protests around the election could mean that staff members might need to avoid venturing into the streets.

The news media was preparing as well. Reporters at The Wall Street Journal’s Washington bureau were issued gas masks and orange bike helmets marked “press.” Local television stations were running “be prepared” segments. Information hotlines and websites were set up.

Security details were bolstered around the private homes of high-profile administration officials. Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post posted on Twitter a photograph from outside Attorney General William P. Barr’s home in suburban Virginia as it was being picketed by supporters of Mr. Trump. They were unhappy that the president was not doing more to ensure the imprisonment of his Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is leading in the polls.

Several restaurants and retail businesses near the White House posted signs saying they would remain closed indefinitely “out of an abundance of caution,” which might as well be the official slogan of 2020.

At Puglisi Hair Cuts, about half a mile west of the White House, Abel Gaona said business was already slow because of the pandemic. Mr. Gaona, a barber, said he worried that the boards over his windows — which the building’s property manager put up last week — would make people think Puglisi was closed, driving away whatever business remained.

“All the barbers, when we’re not working, we don’t make money,” Mr. Gaona said on Monday morning, as he waited for his first customer to walk in.

Still, he said the plan was to close the barbershop on Wednesday out of concern that the election could lead to violence. “I guess when people don’t like whoever wins, they’re going to protest,” Mr. Gaona said.

It was difficult to go anywhere without encountering some sign that this was no normal election week.

This included social media (obviously). Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, reminded his Twitter followers on Monday morning that the country was entering an “unusual” period and that its adversaries might take advantage of this.

“Our intelligence community has warned that the period immediately before and after Election Day is going to be uniquely volatile,” Mr. Warner wrote.

"A Country Facing High Joblessness, Virus Rates and Anxiety Picks Its President","OMAHA — A nation with nearly 8 percent unemployment and mourning more than 231,000 Covid deaths, where four out of five Americans say they feel nervous about the country’s future, gets a final chance Tuesday to decide which candidate is best equipped to lead it past those daunting numbers.

The division and anxiety are evident in conversations among voters in long lines outside early voting places and across browning autumn lawns where warring yard signs pit neighbor against neighbor. Here in the middle of the country, where case counts are surging and college football games were postponed after much angst this past weekend, the worry is all connected, from people on either side of the political chasm.

The coronavirus trends are especially pronounced in several battleground states, including Wisconsin and Michigan, which Joseph R. Biden Jr. is fighting to win back for the Democrats after President Trump’s victories there in 2016, and where infection rates were ticking up as the calendar wound down.

A fundamental unease about the country hovers over most other concerns voters describe as they cast ballots: The future of America troubles them more than whether they may lose a job in this recession, whether they could become ill in this pandemic, whether they could personally be harmed by violent crime.

In national polling by The New York Times and Siena College, voters across the political spectrum say they worry that the next generation of Americans will be worse off. And they are concerned America could lose its democracy.

That sentiment means different things to voters on the left and the right. Republicans describe fears of creeping socialism from within the Democratic Party and deep changes in American values amid protests against the police and historical figures. Democrats fear threats to democracy from within the White House itself, as they describe Mr. Trump undermining the country’s institutions and rule of law.

Other opinion polling leading up to the election has shown Americans deeply divided not just on which candidate they support in the election, but also on questions that have become inseparable from partisan politics this year.

Democrats believe the worst of the coronavirus pandemic is yet to come; Republicans believe the worst is already behind the country. Democrats, by broad margins, approve of the Black Lives Matter movement; Republicans, to a comparable degree, have denounced it.

Voters in the two parties disagree on the outlook for the economy, the importance of wearing masks and even whether schools should reopen in person.

They even see different realities in their personal lives: Just one in five Democrats said they were personally better off than four years ago, in a recent Times/Siena national poll. Nearly nine in ten Republicans said they were better off at the end of the first Trump administration.

Heading into Election Day in 2016, the presidential candidates — and the country — were facing an economy that was pointed upward. There had been 79 months of uninterrupted private-sector job gains, the unemployment rate was running below 5 percent for the first time since the start of the Great Recession, wages were growing and there were high levels of consumer confidence.

Today, the economic picture looks very different. The official unemployment rate in September was 7.9 percent, and more than 12.6 million people are unemployed — five million more than when Mr. Trump took office.

There has been progress since the spring, when the spreading pandemic shut down the economy and virtually halted commerce. But the improvements, fueled in part by $2.2 trillion in government assistance to individuals and businesses, are fading. Hundreds of thousands of new jobless claims are reported every week at levels that still eclipse previous records.

Several major companies have said they expect another wave of layoffs and furloughs. Wall Street analysts warn that growth is likely to continue to slow, leaving the economy about 2.5 percent smaller than it was last year.

In several battleground states, including Pennsylvania (8.1 percent), Texas (8.3 percent), Ohio (8.4 percent), Michigan (8.5 percent) and Nevada (12.6 percent), the jobless rate is higher than the national average. Others are faring better, with Wisconsin at 5.4 percent, Georgia at 6.4 percent and North Carolina at 7.3 percent. All, though, are in much worse shape than they were a year ago.

Through most of the Trump administration, views of the economy closely tracked political preferences. Republicans could be counted on to have optimistic views about the economy and give President Trump the credit, while Democrats had a much more negative outlook on the country’s prospects and Mr. Trump’s effect on them.

“People’s views of the economy are always colored by party identification,” said Lynn Vavreck, a political scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. 

Republicans remain more positive than Democrats, but overall confidence in the economy is low, according to Gallup polls from mid-October, and only 28 percent of those surveyed approved of the way things were going in the United States.

Ms. Vavreck said that in this unusual year, handling of the economy and handling of the pandemic were joined together in a way that is difficult to peel apart.

But, she added, “there is a robust relationship between the actual economy and election outcomes.”

In Nebraska, the jobless rate in September was 3.5 percent, not that far off its rate last September and the lowest in the country. Many supporters of the president here tout the nation’s economy over all as one reason they plan to vote for him. They blame economic woes on the pandemic, which they think was outside his control.

“Trump has improved the economy and once they get a vaccine, I’m sure the economy will go back up again,” said Eli Duberow, 42, from Lincoln, as he was waiting for Mr. Trump’s rally in Omaha to start last week.

On top of economic and election worries, America is facing a pandemic with a growing number of victims; 9.3 million Americans have been infected.

Nebraska, which splits its Electoral College votes and has been a focal point for Mr. Trump, has averaged more than 1,100 coronavirus cases per day over the last week, the most of any point in the pandemic.

That, rather than the pandemic’s economic toll, is more present in the minds of some Nebraska voters — along with, for Republicans, the creep of socialism, and for Democrats, improvements to health care.

In the state’s Second Congressional District race in Omaha’s metropolitan area, the Democratic candidate, Kara Eastman, is being painted by her opponent as a radical socialist. Her Republican rival, Don Bacon, whom she has framed as heartless for not supporting Covid relief funds, had planned for an in-person election night hotel party, but switched it to a scaled-back event for staff and family as new coronavirus cases surged.

Across the country, the virus outlook is bleak and getting bleaker. Infection numbers are trending upward in 41 states, and more than 20 states have set weekly case records in recent days. The nation has averaged more than 82,000 cases per day over the last week, the most yet. Deaths, which tend to lag cases, have climbed more slowly to about 800 daily, still well below the spring peak.

Much of the recent increase has been driven by explosive growth in the same Northern battleground states that could decide the presidential race.

The situation is especially dire in Wisconsin and Iowa, which are third and fifth nationally in recent cases per capita. Ten of the country’s 17 metro areas with the highest rates of new cases over the past two weeks are in Wisconsin. More than 14,000 cases were announced in Iowa in the seven-day period ending Sunday, the most in any weeklong stretch of the pandemic.

Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan are all seeing worrisome rises. Cases have also reached record levels in the Omaha area, where Mr. Trump held a rally last week that drew thousands of mostly unmasked attendees.

In the Southern battlegrounds, the picture is somewhat more encouraging, though still not good. Cases are rising in Arizona, Florida and Texas, but so far remain below the peak levels seen this summer. In Georgia, which has also improved since summer, reports of new infections have leveled off in recent days. But in North Carolina, new cases and deaths are still emerging near record levels.

Worries about voter fraud, disinformation, misinformation, possible violence and disruptions to ballot casting are also troubling many Americans. But in Omaha the recent culprit of a more than hourlong halt to early voting at the Douglas County Elections Commission was less nefarious: a squirrel had chewed through electric equipment.

Dionne Searcey reported from Omaha, Emily Badger from Washington, Patricia Cohen from New York and Mitch Smith from Chicago."
The One Pollster in America Who Is Sure Trump Is Going to Win,"If President Trump pieces together an Electoral College win on Tuesday, at least one pollster — and perhaps only one — will be able to say, “I told you so.”

That person is Robert Cahaly, whose Trafalgar Group this year has released a consistent stream of battleground-state polls showing the president highly competitive against Joseph R. Biden Jr., and often out ahead, in states where most other pollsters have shown a steady Biden lead.

Trafalgar does not disclose its methods, and is considered far too shadowy by other pollsters to be taken seriously. Mostly, they dismiss it as an outlier. But for Mr. Cahaly, “I told you so” is already a calling card.

In 2016, its first time publicly releasing polls, Trafalgar was the firm whose state surveys most effectively presaged Mr. Trump’s upset win. A veteran Republican strategist, Mr. Cahaly even called the exact number of Electoral College votes that Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton would receive — 306 to 227 — although his prediction of which states would get them there was just slightly off.

So with liberal anxieties flaring over whether to trust the polls, the gregarious, goatee-and-bowtie-wearing Mr. Cahaly has been in demand on cable news lately. In addition to frequent appearances on Fox News, Mr. Cahaly was on CNN last week, explaining to Michael Smerconish why he thought the president would walk away with an easy victory — and defending himself against a battery of critiques that Mr. Smerconish called up, one by one, from Mr. Cahaly’s peers.

Amid a crush of pre-election media coverage seeking his theory of the case — it drove more than 1.5 million clicks to Trafalgar’s site on Monday, he said — the big question seems to be: Is it possible to believe a guy whose polls consistently give Mr. Trump just enough support for a narrow lead in most swing states, and who refuses to reveal much of anything about how he gets his data?

In his last few polls of this election season, Mr. Cahaly has found Mr. Trump with two-to-three-point advantages in North Carolina, Arizona, Michigan and Florida, and wider leads elsewhere. That puts him far out of line with almost all major pollsters, whose surveys in those states are generally showing Mr. Biden with the edge. As different as things are this year, it’s hard to miss the echo of 2016, when Trafalgar occupied a similarly lonely position on the eve of Nov. 8.

Above all, Mr. Cahaly’s approach centers on the belief that everyone lies, but especially conservatives. This has largely been disproved by social science, but that hasn’t softened his conviction. To hear him explain it, traditional pollsters (he calls them “dinosaurs”) are crippled by “social desirability bias”: the tendency for respondents to say what they think an interviewer wants to hear, not what they actually believe. In Mr. Trump’s America, he says, that problem has grown worse.

“I just think people are not what they say they are, ever,” Mr. Cahaly said in a recent phone interview from Atlanta, where he lives. “We cannot eliminate the social desirability bias, we can only minimize it.”

Four years ago, he addressed this by asking people both whom they would support for president and whom they thought their neighbors would support. This year, he said, he is using other means to achieve the same result.

But he’s not saying what they are. Mr. Cahaly releases almost no real explanation of his polling methodology; the methods page on Trafalgar’s website contains what reads like a vague advertisement of its services and explains that its polls actively confront social desirability bias, without giving specifics as to how. He says that he uses a mixture of text messages, emails and phone calls — some automated, and some by live callers — to reach an accurate representation of the electorate.

Conventional pollsters, who abide by long-tested and broadly effective methods to glean a representative sample, aren’t buying it. Besides, if there was ever such a thing as a “shy Trump supporter” — someone reluctant to admit that he or she plans to vote for the president — that species has been made virtually extinct during the raucous, rally-holding Trump presidency, said Daniel Cox, a polling and public opinion expert at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute.

“People do not seem embarrassed to support Mr. Trump,” Mr. Cox said. In the past four years, studies seeking to quantify a so-called “shy Trump” effect in surveys have generally found little evidence to support it.

Late last month, Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight got his hands on the cross tabs of a Trafalgar poll of Michigan that was still in progress. It found that more than a quarter of Democrats and Republicans expected to vote for the other party’s nominee, so far out of line with almost all other polls that Mr. Silver called the numbers “just crazy.”

Mr. Cahaly, of course, has no use for the skepticism of experts. He doesn’t seem to care whether he’s abiding by the best practices of the American Association of Public Opinion Research, the standard-bearing trade organization, any more than Mr. Trump says he cares whether the United States’ NATO allies respect him.

Among his polling colleagues, the main sticking point is Mr. Cahaly’s lack of transparency about his methods.

Josh Pasek, a professor of communications, data and political science at the University of Michigan, said that without a sense of the methods the firm uses to reach survey respondents, it’s not possible to rely on the numbers.

“It is wildly inappropriate not to tell me, not only what modes you use to draw your sample, but how specifically you did it,” he said. His general rule: “If somebody’s not transparent you can generally assume they’re crap.”

There is something undeniably enticing about the story of a swashbuckling, norm-busting Southern pollster who rode into 2016 with a fresh approach and proved all the bigger shops wrong. Born in Georgia and raised in upstate South Carolina by a banker and a teacher, Mr. Cahaly developed a politics obsession as a child and majored in it at the University of South Carolina. He soon came under the wing of the pollster Rod Shealy, an acolyte of the Republican strategist Lee Atwater, and eventually started his own firm.

Named after a battle in the Napoleonic Wars when the British navy turned back French and Spanish ships on the high seas, Trafalgar, which he runs alone, has been doing surveys on behalf of clients since 2006.

Most of Trafalgar’s polling is done for conservative and Republican clients, although — in another snub of traditional standards — it has not reliably revealed when surveys are paid for by partisan interests.

In 2010, Mr. Cahaly was arrested and taken to court for violating a law against using automatic calling machines — known as robocalling — to conduct polls. The charges against him were eventually dropped, and he later successfully sued a state law enforcement agency, causing South Carolina’s prohibition on robocalls to be declared unconstitutional.

Mr. Cahaly said he was doing legitimate polling, aimed at truly understanding voters’ opinions — and getting what he called “dead-on” results. During the 2016 Republican primaries, he was early to spot a surge of enthusiasm from many working-class voters who had long felt alienated from politics and helped power Mr. Trump’s ascent.

“I kept getting these stories about people who showed up to vote and didn’t know how to use the voting machines, they hadn’t voted in so long,” Mr. Cahaly said. So he began to look into who those people might be, and used data available online to create a list of roughly 50 lifestyle characteristics — including, for instance, whether they owned a fishing license — to identify the sorts of low-engagement voters who were turning out in droves. He used that data to make sure he was reaching the right kinds of respondents as he polled off the voter file in advance of the general election.

In 2018, Mr. Cahaly again amassed a successful track record polling Senate and governors’ races, including surveys that correctly presaged Ron DeSantis’s and Rick Scott’s wins in Florida.

This year, he has continued to see strong Trump support among these voters, and he believes other pollsters are again underestimating their importance. Among Mr. Cahaly’s theories is that it takes five times as many calls to get a conservative voter to complete a poll than to get a liberal one. Others in the field say they find no evidence to support this in their own work. 

But Mr. Cahaly insists it is presumptuous for pollsters to assume that they are drawing a representative sample of voters just because they are adhering to the scientific method. He returns to the country’s political divide, and how unwilling Americans are nowadays to communicate with each other from across the breach of suspicion. In a sense, he has positioned himself as a bard of Trumpism, giving voice to a silent majority — or at least, a majority in the Electoral College — that knows the elites consider its views deplorable, and therefore won’t express them freely to just anyone.

“Lee Atwater drilled into everyone around me that you have to get out of the head of politicos and into the head of Joe Six-Pack,” Mr. Cahaly said. “What do the average people think? And to do that I like to talk to average people. I like to follow up polling calls and chat with people for 30 minutes.”

Mr. Cahaly feels no need to reveal his techniques, despite the near-universal doubt about his work from his peers. “I’ve given away enough; I’m not giving away any more,” he said, arguing that it had been a mistake to even tell the public about his “neighbor question,” which some other firms have since adopted in their own surveys.

“I think we’ve developed something that’s very different from what other people do, and I really am not interested in telling people how we do it,” he said. “Just judge us by whether we get it right.”"
"In a Swing County in a Swing State, the Verdict Is In: It’s Going to Be Close","[Follow our live Trump vs Biden 2020 election updates and analysis.]

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — Dan Parri, a lawyer in the city of Clearwater, loved driving around town with the Pinellas County Jeep Club — until some members started festooning their vehicles with Trump 2020 campaign flags.

So Mr. Parri spoke up, then kept speaking. The Confederate flag also bothered him, he told his fellow Jeep enthusiasts, as did the systemic racism that brought about the killing of George Floyd.

And when his words were met with resistance, he founded what he calls a “progressive Jeep club.”

“We have about 70 members,” he said, standing proudly next to his Jeep, which he has named Prometheus and decorated with red, white and blue balloons; an American flag; a Black Lives Matter flag; another flag with an L.G.B.T. rainbow he found on Amazon; and lots of Biden-Harris campaign paraphernalia.

In any other year, one might chalk up Mr. Parri’s new club as just another curiosity in Pinellas County, Fla., population 974,996.

But in 2020, in the swing state that crowned past presidents by small margins, much in this country is riding on the all-important question of who flies what flag on which Jeep.

As returns stream in across the state on Tuesday night, more than a few eyes will be glued to this stretch of the central Gulf Coast, which includes liberal St. Petersburg and conservative Clearwater, the vacation hub and base of the Church of Scientology.

The population of Pinellas County, about three-quarters of which is white, includes a good number of older retirees and suburban women, two groups shown by polling to significantly favor Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential nominee. Yet the county’s voting preferences this year are much harder to discern: Among registered voters, about 256,000 are registered as Democrats and about 252,000 as Republicans.

That leaves Pinellas as a swing county in a swing state.

“In Florida, we’re another melting pot and everyone brings their values of what they have with them — right, wrong or indifferent,” said Shawn Berger, 48, who lives in Dunedin, at the county’s north end, and works in information technology.

After Barack Obama won Pinellas County by hefty margins in 2008 and 2012, Donald J. Trump narrowly triumphed here by roughly 6,000 votes, out of about half a million cast. Hillary Clinton visited Florida more than any other battleground in the final month of the 2016 presidential campaign, spending heavily on ads throughout the state. But postelection observers said her appeals to middle-class voters in Pinellas County didn’t resonate as well as Mr. Obama’s had.

These days, with most polls indicating that it’s anyone’s guess who will carry Florida, Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden have been barnstorming the area once more in the final stretch.

Both men held rallies in nearby Tampa on Thursday that underlined the polar-opposite realities each candidate now inhabits: Mr. Biden’s gathering was socially distanced and focused on the death toll from the coronavirus, while Mr. Trump’s took no such precautions and repeated unsubstantiated claims about the business dealings of Mr. Biden’s son Hunter in Ukraine.

Mr. Berger attended Mr. Trump’s rally, arriving in Tampa at 11:30 p.m. the night before with a group of friends to ensure they would be among the first to enter the stadium to see the president.

Mr. Berger, a conservative who said he had blocked Fox News on social media for being “too mainstream,” said he enjoyed the crowd’s excitement and the president’s speech. He even had his young daughter take a day off school to attend the rally with him because, he said, he “felt that it would be a good learning experience, so she could learn about some history and politics firsthand.”

“Is he crass? Does he have a locker-room mentality?” Mr. Berger asked, referring to the president. “Yeah, sure, but I’m not hiring him to be nice.”

Travel south from Mr. Berger’s home in Dunedin and the political landscape changes. St. Petersburg — once overshadowed by Clearwater’s beach-retirement hub — has been transformed by recent years that have brought a mix of gentrification and progressive politics. The Trump flags mostly vanish, replaced by gay pride banners and organic food markets.

A short drive away at the Tropicana Stadium, Terri Lipsey Scott, the director of the city’s Dr. Carter G. Woodson African American Museum, gave a speech at a drive-in, get-out-the-vote rally in honor of Representative John Lewis, the Georgia Democrat and voting rights champion who died over the summer.

At the rally, speakers mainly focused on what they said were efforts to block voters from casting ballots this year — and how to combat them. Those efforts included one by Florida Republicans, who sidestepped a statewide referendum to extend the franchise to former felons by requiring them to pay court fees. One in five Black Floridians is thought to have a felony conviction and could be unable to vote because of it.

Ms. Scott ended her speech by calling on attendees, parked and listening from their cars, to drive in a convoy through town in support of Biden — as Trump supporters had done for their candidate in recent days.

“I got a call from the local police saying if we block traffic then we’ll get ticketed,” she said. “I’m not encouraging anyone to break the law, but today is a day for some ‘good trouble,’” she added, using one of Mr. Lewis’s signature phrases from his civil rights struggles.

Across town in an early-voting line, Albert Hill, 22, seemed less caught up in the politics of the year than the anxiety of being a recent college graduate in a grim job market. Mr. Hill, who had briefly worked for a clothing company after earning a degree in fashion marketing in May, was without a job after the pandemic shut down much of the county’s economy.

“It’s the next four years that I’ll have to think about most, who is elected and what jobs are in place,” he said.

Mr. Hill was voting for Mr. Biden.

Down the street stood Billy Overcast — “spelled like the weather,” said Mr. Overcast, pointing up, however, to a typically clear day with one hand, a “Trump 2020” flag in the other.

He said he understood Mr. Hill’s concerns, as a young person facing economic uncertainty. Mr. Overcast found out that one of his adult children would vote for Mr. Biden recently.

Mr. Overcast said that in his view he had raised all of his children as conservatives politically and culturally, even teaching one to shoot with a 22-caliber squirrel gun that had been given to him when he was younger. It hadn’t really worked, he said.

A neighbor riding a bicycle nearby took off his headphones and shouted that Mr. Trump was a dictator.

Mr. Overcast sighed. He said that living in the same county as the Church of Scientology’s headquarters had taught him how to tolerate almost any point of view, even that of the neighbor, who he suspected had stolen the Trump sign from his lawn.

Mr. Overcast said his home security system had filmed the culprit making off with it. But rather than confront the neighbor, Mr. Overcast just bought another sign.

“But with this one I tied 90 pounds of fishing line on it and tied it to a tree in my yard,” he said."
"In the Trump Campaign, Government Agencies and Officials Have Often Provided Help","WASHINGTON — President Trump’s national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien, has hit the road in recent weeks — not touring war zones, but promoting Mr. Trump’s record in swing states.

Mr. O’Brien boasted about Mr. Trump’s job-producing push at a shipyard in Kittery, Maine. He delivered remarks at Drake University in Iowa, calling the world more peaceful and prosperous “because of the president’s policies.” And he toured a Wisconsin manufacturing plant and shipyard, telling a local radio host that Mr. Trump is a “peacemaker” but that journalists will not “give him much credit.”

In the days and weeks leading up to Election Day, Mr. Trump has employed every tool at his disposal to win another four years in the Oval Office in a consequential election that is likely to help determine the limits on a president’s ability to bend the government to his whims.

While the national security adviser is a traditionally nonpartisan job, Mr. O’Brien has been part of a sustained effort by the president, members of his cabinet and top aides to use the powers of incumbency in ways that go far beyond his predecessors, harnessing the levers of government power and the authority of Mr. Trump’s office to help him stay there.

Last month, Department of Homeland Security officials gathered reporters, cameramen and photographers in Pennsylvania and Minnesota to highlight the president’s immigration policies, even though the routine arrests they announced took place across various states. The agency has paid for ominous-looking billboards in Pennsylvania, a state crucial to Mr. Trump’s re-election, depicting wanted immigrants charged with violent crimes.

On Oct. 15, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo participated in five call-in interviews with broadcast organizations, four of them in the swing states Florida, Georgia, Arizona and Michigan.

The Office of Special Counsel has opened two investigations into whether Mr. Pompeo has illegally campaigned for Mr. Trump. One is focused on a speech Mr. Pompeo delivered during the Republican National Convention while on a diplomatic trip to Jerusalem, and another on his declaration that the State Department might release new emails from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton before the election.

“We’ve got the emails,” Mr. Pompeo said in an interview with Fox News, one day after Mr. Trump expressed impatience with the secretary’s inaction. “We’re getting them out. We’re going to get all this information out so the American people can see it.”

The use of government resources to help the president’s political fortunes is taking place in a bitterly polarized country, and the assertion of raw political power by Mr. Trump and his aides has drawn furious criticism from Democrats and ethics experts.

“There’s a reason that secretaries of state and national security advisers don’t campaign,” said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut. “It’s really important for a handful of national security figures to remain above the partisan scrum, and when they become just another partisan actor it does rob them of some of their credibility.”

Other presidents have embraced the perks of incumbency to their advantage. But no other modern president of either party has so brazenly directed government action toward his own benefit by so many agencies and departments.

In the months leading up to Election Day, the Justice Department represented Mr. Trump in a defamation lawsuit brought by a woman who had accused him of rape. His intelligence chiefs declassified documents central to the president’s campaign rhetoric. Coronavirus aid checks to taxpayers from the Treasury Department prominently featured Mr. Trump’s signature, and food boxes for the poor included a letter from the president. Mr. Trump proposed, though never delivered, a $200 discount drug prescription card for seniors — a gift timed to arrive in the middle of voting.

Mr. Trump and his aides have pressed scientists to approve treatments and vaccines before the election. Attorney General William P. Barr has assailed Democratic-led cities and intervened in ballot cases to benefit Mr. Trump’s campaign. The president has virtually transformed the Department of Homeland Security into an engine of his campaign, confronting protesters in cities even against the wishes of governors and mayors.

And members of the president’s cabinet have fanned out across the country, ostensibly conducting official business, but doing so in places undeniably critical to the president’s personal political fortunes. In late September, Mr. Pompeo gave an official speech in — of all places — the Capitol building in Madison, Wis., a critical swing state that Mr. Trump narrowly won in 2016.

“Robert O’Brien’s presence on the campaign trail, or pseudo campaign trail, is more evidence of how irregular the Trump administration is and how badly things are going for the president in Washington and in the campaign,” said John Gans, the author of “White House Warriors: How the National Security Council Transformed the American Way of War.”

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Trump’s rival for the White House, has been blunt in his condemnation of the president’s use of the government for political gain, and he described the Justice Department under the leadership of Mr. Barr, a fierce Trump ally, as essentially corrupt.

“The Department of Trump,” Mr. Biden said.

That name could also apply to the Department of Homeland Security.

On the last night of the Republican convention, it was hard to miss the display of the Trump-Pence campaign logo on Jumbotron screens flanking both sides of the White House. But inside, the president and his acting secretary of homeland security, Chad Wolf, held an official naturalization ceremony for a half-dozen new Americans — a solemn occasion turned into a campaign stunt and broadcast to millions of people as part of Mr. Trump’s political convention.

After Mr. Wolf and Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, held an event in the shadow of Mr. Trump’s border wall last week to celebrate the near completion of 400 miles of the project and criticize policies embraced by Democrats, the nonprofit government watchdog American Oversight requested that the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general investigate whether the senior leadership had violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from engaging in political activities on the job.

Last summer when Mr. Trump turned the focus of his re-election campaign to protesters damaging statues and monuments during a speech at Mount Rushmore, the Homeland Security Department was also there to help.

That same weekend, Mr. Wolf announced a new task force to protect “historic monuments, memorials, statues and federal facilities” that used tactical agents from various agencies. Some of those agents, specifically from Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, were then deployed to Portland, Ore., and suddenly were at the center of the president’s re-election campaign.

After tactical teams from the Homeland Security Department were deployed, the Trump campaign pointed to images of the camouflage-wearing agents clashing with demonstrators as they portrayed cities led by Democrats as settings of crime and chaos.

Mr. Wolf also delayed the release of an intelligence bulletin warning that the Russians were specifically targeting Mr. Trump’s opponent, Mr. Biden, by denigrating his mental health.

Mr. Wolf has said the quality of the product needed to be improved.

But in a whistle-blower complaint filed to the House Intelligence Committee, Brian Murphy, the former head of the homeland security intelligence branch, said Mr. Wolf blocked dissemination of the bulletin because the briefing “made the president look bad.”

Inside D.H.S., some career officials have tried to slow or stop what they say are overly political efforts by the president and his allies. In April 2019, when Mr. Trump’s top aides pressured immigration agencies to release arrested migrants into so-called sanctuary cities represented by Democratic lawmakers, homeland security lawyers and even a top ICE official, Matthew T. Albence, objected, saying that there would be liability issues if a migrant were injured during transport.

Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the acting deputy secretary of the department, dismissed concerns about the agency during a press briefing on Monday.

“We don’t stop doing our job because there’s an election coming or going,” Mr. Cuccinelli said. “I make no apologies for being here. This is part of my job.”

While Mr. Trump was accused of politicizing Mr. Cuccinelli’s department from the early days of the administration, the intelligence agencies were mostly spared. But this year, the president installed a pair of political allies as director of national intelligence, who quickly moved to declassify and release information to benefit Mr. Trump.

The president initially made Richard Grenell, then the ambassador to Germany, the acting director of national intelligence. He was later replaced by John Ratcliffe, a Republican congressman who was confirmed by the Senate to take the job permanently.

Mr. Ratcliffe continued Mr. Grenell’s efforts to declassify documents that raised questions about the origins of the inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Republicans had claimed that the documents substantiated the allegations Mr. Trump makes on the campaign trail that his predecessor had spied on him.

Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, condemned the actions of the administration’s national security team to boost Mr. Trump’s campaign.

He said the White House “has bent the national security adviser to mislead the country, has appointed a director of national intelligence who is willing to do the same and has installed an attorney general who has no compunction about deceiving the public in any way the president wishes.”

But with the election approaching, the president’s top aides show no signs of letting up. Last week, Mr. O’Brien attended a mining industry round table in Hermantown, Minn., hosted by a Republican congressman.

In a statement, John Ullyot, a National Security Council spokesman, said that Mr. O’Brien had visited Minnesota to focus on “protecting America’s critical mineral industry and supply chains for national security reasons” and had traveled to Wisconsin to highlight the role of defense manufacturers.

“The important work of protecting our national security continues regardless of domestic political events,” he added.

Mr. Ullyot did not identify any non-swing states Mr. O’Brien had visited in recent weeks.

"As Voting Nears End, Battle Intensifies Over Which Ballots Will Count","[President-elect Joe Biden’s victory prompts spontaneous celebrations.]

With the election coming to a close, the Trump and Biden campaigns, voting rights organizations and conservative groups are raising money and dispatching armies of lawyers for what could become a state-by-state, county-by-county legal battle over which ballots will ultimately be counted.

The deployments — involving hundreds of lawyers on both sides — go well beyond what has become normal since the disputed outcome in 2000, and are the result of the open efforts of President Trump and the Republicans to disqualify votes on technicalities and baseless charges of fraud at the end of a campaign in which the voting system has been severely tested by the coronavirus pandemic.

In the most aggressive moves to knock out registered votes in modern memory, Republicans have already sought to nullify ballots before they are counted in several states that could tip the balance of the Electoral College.

In an early test of one effort, a federal judge in Texas on Monday ruled against local Republicans who wanted to compel state officials to throw out more than 127,000 ballots cast at newly created drive-through polling places in the Houston area. The federal court ruling, which Republicans said they would appeal, came after a state court also ruled against them.

In key counties in Nevada, Michigan and Pennsylvania, Republicans are seeking, with mixed results so far, to force election board offices to give their election observers more open access so they can more effectively challenge absentee ballots as they are processed, a tactic Republicans in North Carolina are seeking to adopt statewide.

And everywhere, in a year that has seen record levels of early voting and a huge surge in use of voting by mail, Republicans are gearing up to challenge ballots with missing signatures or unclear postmarks.

In his last days of campaigning, Mr. Trump has essentially admitted that he does not expect to win without going to court. “As soon as that election is over,” he told reporters over the weekend, “we’re going in with our lawyers.”

Trailing consistently in the polls, Mr. Trump in that moment said out loud what other Republicans have preferred to say quietly, which is that his best chance of holding onto power at this point may rest in a scorched-earth campaign to disqualify as many votes as possible for his Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr.

If there is a clear-cut outcome on Tuesday night that could not plausibly be challenged via legal action, all of the planning on both sides could become moot. But if there is no decisive result, the following days would likely see an intensifying multifront battle fought in a variety of states.

After months of claiming that any election outcome other than a victory for him would have to have been “rigged,” the president used his final days on the campaign trail to cast doubt on the very process of tabulating the count, suggesting without any evidence that any votes counted after Tuesday, no matter how legal, must be suspect.

Both sides expect Mr. Trump and his allies to try again to disqualify late-arriving ballots in the emerging center of the legal fight, Pennsylvania, after the state’s high court rejected a previous attempt and the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal.

The scale of the Republican effort is beyond any that longtime civil rights lawyers said they could recall, and they, along with lawyers for the Democrats, said they were ready to meet Mr. Trump’s lawyers in court.

“This is the most blatant, open attempt at mass disenfranchisement of voters that I’ve ever witnessed,” said Dale Ho, the director of the Voting Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, which has litigated several major cases this year.

Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic Party, said Democrats were keeping careful track of all ballots that were being rejected in key swing states, under a strategy to get as many as possible fixed and reinstated now and seeking to force the reinstatement of the rest in postelection litigation if the closeness of the Electoral College count requires it.

Democratic Party lawyers, buoyed by the ruling in Texas and hopeful that even ideologically conservative judges would deny the Republicans’ more brazen moves, were also preparing to monitor polling locations to be on the lookout for premature closings, long lines and unruly, pro-Trump election observers.

Mr. Trump comes to the fight having shown a willingness to use the levers of power to further his personal political interests in ways few other presidents have.

A wild card for both sides is the posture the Justice Department will take in voting disputes under Attorney General William P. Barr. On Monday, the department announced it was sending civil rights division personnel to monitor voting at precincts across the country, including in key areas like Philadelphia, Miami, Detroit and Houston. That is standard operating procedure, but both sides were girding for possible breaks from protocol given Mr. Barr’s own statements about potential for fraud, which have echoed Mr. Trump’s.

The Republican efforts moved to an even more aggressive footing on Sunday, after Mr. Trump made clear his intention to challenge an unfavorable outcome through a focus in particular on the mail-in vote, which both sides expect will favor Mr. Biden.

“I think it’s terrible that we can’t know the results of an election the night of the election,” Mr. Trump told reporters ahead of a rally on Sunday night in North Carolina before saying he intended to send in his lawyers.

On Monday night, in an extraordinary moment that encapsulated the tenor of his presidency, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that the Supreme Court’s Pennsylvania decision would “allow rampant and unchecked cheating” and “undermine our entire systems of laws” and “induce violence in the streets,” drawing a warning on the platform that it was misleading.

The president has no legal authority to stop the count on Tuesday night, and even in normal election years, states often take days or even weeks before completing their tallies and certifying the outcome.

“If a jurisdiction doesn’t get done counting its ballots on election night because of the volume, broken machines or any other reason, there’s zero grounds for stopping it under any state’s laws,” said Benjamin L. Ginsberg, one of the nation’s leading elections lawyers, who served as counsel to multiple Republican presidential candidates. “You’re just going to disenfranchise people for his sport?”

Many states require ballots to arrive by Election Day to be counted, but several of them have sought to allow to be counted ballots that are postmarked on or before Election Day but arrive within a set number of days afterward. (In Pennsylvania it is three.)

In an interview, Justin Riemer, the chief counsel for the Republican National Committee, indicated that much of the legal wrangling in the days to come would be over such late-arriving ballots, and he disputed Democratic charges that Republicans were solely seeking to knock out valid Democratic votes.

“Our position is that all lawfully cast ballots should be counted,” he said. “If the ballot doesn’t meet the deadline, then I guess if one considers that to be a technicality, so be it, but those ballots shouldn’t be counted.”

He said the party’s efforts this year were about ensuring the election was conducted by the letter of the law. “We are protecting the existing safeguards that are in place and making sure the law is enforced and ensuring in the process that everyone can have confidence in the results,” he said.

Mr. Trump has spent the past few years appointing conservative judges, an effort that has affected the balance on several appellate panels that will be critical in swing-state voting fights while giving the Supreme Court a new, 6-to-3 conservative tilt.

And he has another wild card in Mr. Barr.

This summer, Mr. Barr made a string of exaggerated claims about the problems with mail-in voting and opened the door to sending in federal authorities to stop voter fraud threats.

Behind closed doors, the attorney general briefed Mr. Trump on incremental developments in minor voter fraud investigations. The president, the White House and his campaign then promoted the cases as evidence that mail-in voting was highly problematic.

In the past couple of weeks, however, Mr. Barr and the Justice Department have gone quiet, leading to a new pressure campaign from conservative groups to aid Mr. Trump’s efforts to stop the counting of any mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day.

“D.O.J. should be prepared to go to court on this — it’s Election Day, not election week or month,” said Tom Fitton, the head of the conservative group Judicial Watch.

Mr. Fitton, who said his group had more lawyers and investigators dedicated to scrutinizing this election than any other, said that Mr. Barr needed to be prepared to use his legal power — including the F.B.I. — to ensure that states were keeping ballots that came in before Election Day separate from those that came in after.

Both sides agreed that some of the most important postelection legal wrangling would most likely take place in Pennsylvania, where uncertainty surrounds the state’s plan to count ballots that are postmarked by Election Day but arrive in the three following days. The United States Supreme Court last week allowed Pennsylvania to keep that plan intact, though some of the justices opened the door to considering the issue again if necessary, and Republicans have indicated they might go back to the court.

That situation has led Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania’s attorney general and a Democrat, to issue guidance that election officials should segregate any ballots that arrive after 8 p.m. Tuesday.

“We made a careful decision to segregate those ballots in part to stave off possible future legal challenges from Donald Trump and his enablers,” Mr. Shapiro said.

Some lawyers also believe there is the potential that unclear postmarks will be to 2020 what “dimpled chads” were to the 2000 recount in Florida. (The term denoted unclear preferences on the state’s punch-card ballots.)

“I see that being the main area where there could be some disputes between the two sides,” said Mr. Riemer, the Republican Party lawyer. “There is some ambiguity particularly in Pennsylvania in regard to how you treat a ballot that arrives after Election Day but does not have an indication that it is postmarked by Election Day.”

Mr. Shapiro said his team had been preparing for different levels of challenges from Trump-aligned lawyers and groups.

“They’ll be fanned out across Pennsylvania, on Election Day, and prepared for whatever challenges to possibly come beginning at 8:01 when the polls close,” he said.

The Trump campaign and Republicans have also been seeking greater access to the election boards counting ballots, as they did in Clark County, Nev., in a lawsuit that would have slowed counting there. Democrats equated that suit with harassment.

On Monday, a Nevada judge, James E. Wilson Jr., sided with the Democrats.

“There is no evidence that any vote that should lawfully be counted has or will not be counted,” Judge Wilson wrote. “There is no evidence that any vote that should lawfully not be counted has been or will be counted.”

With hours to go before Election Day, Republicans said they were considering an appeal."

SANFORD, Fla. — If the election were a couple, it might just be the Hogans from Deland, Fla.

Robert Hogan, 61, is a committed supporter of President Trump, who praises his handling of the economy and his business background. Pamala Hogan, 55, is so horrified over how Mr. Trump has governed the country that she changed her voter registration to the Democratic Party. They both voted early for the first time this year, casting their ballots in the kind of suburban Orlando county that could swing this quadrennial battleground state.

“We’ve agreed to not speak about it in our house,” said Ms. Hogan, a graphic artist. “As passionate as you can feel I am, he’s also as passionate.”

But when pressed on their predictions for tomorrow night, they both stuck with their guys.

“I really think Trump could win by a lot more than people would believe,” said Mr. Hogan, who works in commercial contracting. “His supporters are quiet but he’s an overperformer.”

Ms. Hogan fired back: “Biden’s going to win because we woke up and realized what could happen.”

Here in the Sunshine State, both have about an equal chance of being proved right.

Florida is always a jittery place around election time, but I’ve never seen it quite like this.

Democrats and Republicans are sweating out the final hours of the race here. Our polling average shows the contest within two percentage points. Internal numbers that I’ve seen from the campaigns and other political players have it about the same, maybe even tighter.

But the fried nerves aren’t just about the outcome of the election. The voters I interviewed around Orlando and Tampa in recent days worried about what might follow the results — lawsuits, protests or even violence.

That sentiment isn’t unique to Florida. The whole country — really, the whole world! — is anxiously watching.

So why end this marathon in Florida? Well, I must admit I have a soft spot for this kooky swing state, the home of frozen iguana forecasts, pet alligators and Mar-a-Lago drama.

It’s a place that is really many political states in one, where you can interview Venezuelan waitresses in the morning, talk to evangelical students in the afternoon and spend the evening with Midwestern retirees. A place where elections are expensive and almost always close.

A place that’s kind of like America.

It’s also 75 degrees and sunny today, and my cortadito is made just right. (Try to beat that, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.)

But I didn’t just come to Florida for its political diversity. I came because — like so many of you, dear readers — I am tired and ready to just know What Is Going to Happen?!?!?!?!

Florida will offer us some of the earliest insights during the big show tomorrow night.

For a state famous for election blunders, Florida is promising that this year will be different. There are some key factors working in favor of a quick count: Unlike Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, Florida allows counties to start processing mailed-in ballots weeks before Election Day. All those mail ballots must be received (not postmarked) by Nov. 3, so there won’t be more that arrive after Election Day and need to be counted. And the early-vote count is supposed to be released by 8:30 p.m. tomorrow.

Now, if the race is as close as expected, Florida still may not be called before we fall asleep tomorrow night. But the early results should give us a sense of the direction of the race.

If Mr. Trump loses Florida, he must nearly sweep the remaining swing states — not an easy lift given his current numbers. If he wins Florida, we may be facing a longer road to calling a winner, as the race could be determined in states that will take more time to count. (I’m looking at you, Pennsylvania.)

In Central Florida, the Hogans are getting ready. Ms. Hogan said she had asked her husband what they should have for their election night meal. One of them, she figured, would be celebrating.

Mr. Hogan isn’t so sure. “Here’s something I will predict,” he said. “There’s going to be rioting not matter who wins.”

With the end of voting almost here, there were lots of questions about when we would know the results. You ask, we answer. Even if we don’t really know!

With so many states using mail-in ballots, I’ve read that we will probably not know the results of the election on Nov. 4. Does anyone have an idea of when we will know?

— Mary Beth Patten, Florence, Mont.

Well, this is an easy one.

No.

When we will know a winner depends on a lot of questions we can’t answer right now. How many issues will there be with voting on Tuesday? How quickly will states be able to count a flood of mail ballots? How tight will the election end up being in crucial areas?

What we do know is that the counting is likely to take longer this year. Two key battleground states — Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — can’t start counting all those mailed-in votes until Election Day. Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia allow postmarked ballots to arrive after Election Day. Even by the most optimistic of estimates, only nine states expect to have at least 98 percent of unofficial results reported by noon Wednesday.

In Pennsylvania, which could be the state that decides a close election, the secretary of state has said that she expects “the overwhelming majority” of votes will be counted by … Friday.

This is not new: We have never had final results on election night. News outlets declare a winner based on projections, once it becomes clear that partial counts make it impossible for one candidate to overcome the advantage of the other.

The difference this year is that because of how so many of the votes are being cast — by mail, provisionally, early — news outlets’ decision desks may not have enough information on election night to make an accurate projection.

Which brings us to our next question …

How will the TV networks and news organizations “call” an election on election night?

— Gene Gorrin, Union, N.J.

The short answer? Very, very carefully. And maybe not on election night at all.

Various news outlets, including The New York Times, have said they plan to prioritize caution over their journalistic instinct for beating the competition.

How the election results are reported by television networks is likely to look different tomorrow night. As my colleague Michael Grynbaum reported, real-time results will be displayed in the context of the total expected vote, including absentee and mail-in ballots — a change from the usual metric of “precincts reporting.”

There’s also likely to be more information about how and why the calls are being made. The Associated Press, which expects to call about 7,000 races up and down the ballot, plans to explain its calls — or lack of them — in real time.

The Times relies on information from The A.P., in addition to analysis from its own election experts, to call races. We will also be bringing back our famous “needle” that shows who is on track to win — but only for three key states where we expect to have enough information about which votes have been counted. (The needle itself does not make the race calls.)

Want to know more? A number of outlets are offering pretty detailed explainers of their race call operations.

Does the president have any legal power himself, through the Department of Justice, or through the court system to curtail state ballot counting at midnight, Nov. 3?

— Norm Goldman

President Trump has recently argued, ignoring the history of every election night, that states should stop counting ballots by the end of Nov. 3. But he cannot prevent states, which manage their own elections, from counting ballots beyond midnight.

No state ever reports final results on election night, even in years where there isn’t a pandemic. And to be clear, Mr. Trump cannot directly dispute the election results in court, but he could challenge voting methods and election procedures in an effort to change the postelection counting process.

Mr. Trump has said that he wanted to get Justice Amy Coney Barrett onto the Supreme Court before the election because he expects the court to rule on postelection challenges. This is an extremely unusual occurrence — even if some people still have reserved trauma from the 2000 election, when the Supreme Court stopped Florida’s manual recount, effectively handing the election to George W. Bush.

But last week, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh breathed new life into the Bush v. Gore ruling, writing that the decision could play a role in deciding potential challenges to election rulings from state courts.

"Statehouse Seats Are Up for Grabs, and With Them, Great Power","[Follow our live Trump vs Biden 2020 election updates and analysis.]

WASHINGTON — Abortion. Guns. Police. Schools. Health care. Covid-19.

These are just a few of the issues that state legislatures will make laws about next year. Not to mention the once-a-decade event: redrawing state and national electoral maps after the decennial census, an exercise that can give one political party a deep and enduring advantage in lawmaking for years.

So, while the campaigns for president and seats in Congress may have absorbed much of the nation’s attention, the elections to determine control of state government — more than 5,000 legislative races farther down the ballot — could also have a major effect on Americans’ lives.

About 80 percent of the nation’s 7,383 state legislative seats are up for grabs this year, with elections in 44 states, according to Tim Storey, an expert at the National Conference of State Legislatures, or N.C.S.L.

The stakes are high for both parties. Democrats are on offense in state elections this year, trying to pry chambers away from G.O.P. control, but Mr. Storey said it was highly unlikely that the Democrats would make gains anywhere close to those that Republicans scored in the 2010 election cycle, when they gained a whopping 24 chambers, the culmination of a historic realignment of Southern legislatures toward the Republican Party.

“If there are gains, they won’t be extraordinary or off the charts,” Mr. Storey said. Demographic change is slow, he said, and movement of a state from one party to the other is usually gradual.

A few of the chambers Democrats are aiming to flip, he said, are the Texas House, the North Carolina House and Senate, the Arizona House and Senate, the Minnesota Senate, and the Pennsylvania, Michigan and Iowa Houses. Republicans, for their part, are looking to take New Hampshire’s House and Senate.

Republicans have a distinct advantage in statehouses today. Of the 98 partisan legislative chambers in 49 states, about three-fifths — 59 chambers — are controlled by Republicans, and the remaining 39 by Democrats, according to the N.C.S.L. (Nebraska’s Legislature has only one chamber and its elections are officially nonpartisan.)

In all but one of the states with two chambers (Minnesota is the exception), the same party controls both chambers. That is an effect of rising polarization and the growing tendency of voters to stick with a single political party up and down the ballot.

The 2010 Republican sweep coincided with a census, giving Republicans disproportionate control just when lines were to be redrawn for congressional and state electoral districts across the country. The effects are still being felt today.

“I think most people, including Democrats, realize that Republicans were ahead of the game in 2008 and 2009 and 2010, and got control of the legislatures,” said Wendy Underhill, a specialist on redistricting at the N.C.S.L. This time, she argued, “both teams are equally well prepared.”

The redistricting process begins again next year, when the Census Bureau delivers population data to each state. That usually happens by April 1, though the timeline is less certain this year because of delays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and by continuing litigation.

Whatever the timing, though, the outcome of this week’s balloting will be critical. While some states use nonpartisan or bipartisan commissions to draw electoral maps, the process in most states is controlled by the majority party in the state legislature.

“The state races have never been more important than they are this year,” said David Abrams, deputy executive director of the Republican State Leadership Committee, which focuses on electing Republicans to state offices. He said that his group was focusing on 14 target states and that in many of them, Democrats who flipped Republican seats in 2018 are vulnerable now. “The conventional wisdom is that we are entirely on defense, but that’s not actually true,” he said.

Issues beyond redistricting power are at stake, too — for example, health care access, which is especially important during the pandemic.

In North Carolina, where Republicans have controlled both chambers since the national sweep in 2010, Democrats are fighting to take back control, and want to expand Medicaid to cover low-income North Carolinians.

North Carolina is one of 12 remaining states — all with Republican-controlled legislatures and most of them in the South — that have not expanded their Medicaid programs under the Affordable Care Act.

Abortion is another example. Joe Pojman, the executive director of the Texas Alliance for Life, said his organization was focused not just on helping Mr. Trump win the state, but also on the down-ballot races for the Texas House, which Democrats hope to flip.

If that happens, Mr. Pojman said, “it would be very difficult to advance our agenda.”

One goal, he said, is a “trigger law” that would ban abortion in the state if and when Roe v. Wade is overturned. The new composition of the Supreme Court is seen as having made such a reversal more of a possibility, and similar bills have passed in other Republican-controlled states.

Abortion rights advocates say they are watching the Iowa House, which Democrats are trying to flip. The chamber voted this year to place on the ballot a proposal to amend the State Constitution to say that it does not protect abortion, according to Elisabeth Smith, chief counsel for state policy and advocacy at the Center for Reproductive Rights, an abortion rights group. If Republicans lose control of the Iowa House, she said, the initiative would not pass a second time, a requirement for putting the proposal before the voters.

Elsewhere, efforts at curbing police violence are at stake. In Minnesota, where Democrats control the House and are hoping to flip the Senate, a policing bill that passed the Legislature over the summer was weaker than Democrats wanted. It did not require officers to live in the communities they serve, nor did it completely ban choke holds or impose penalties for using them, according to Jessica Oaxaca, a spokeswoman for Senate Democrats. It also lacked protections for police officers who report illegal uses of force, she said, adding that in order to pass tougher changes, Democrats would need control of the Senate.

“We have to win the majority to have the conversation,” she said."
National Guard Readies for Election Day Deployment,"This year has brought a barrage of emergencies across the country that have required the National Guard — the coronavirus pandemic, hurricanes, wildfires and a wave of street protests. Now those troops are preparing in case they are needed once again, this time for potential violent unrest in the wake of the election.

Communities are bracing for protest regardless of the election’s outcome. If demonstrations turn violent and overwhelm the local police, governors will almost certainly call out their states’ National Guard.

Under federal law, it is the Guard, not active-duty military, that can enforce order on domestic soil. It has already happened dozens of times this year in cities across the country.

States are already on alert for violence. On Monday, Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts ordered 1,000 members of the National Guard to be on standby in case of turmoil following Tuesday’s election.

And in Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown declared a state of emergency for the Portland area, citing concern for potential violence surrounding the election. Under the plans, the Oregon State Police and the Multnomah County Sheriff will take over management of public safety in the city, and Governor Brown said she has directed the National Guard to have members trained in crowd control to be on standby.

“We know that there are some people who might use peaceful election night protests to promote violence and property destruction,” Ms. Brown said Monday. “That behavior is not acceptable.”

Hundreds of National Guard troops already have been called up in non-law-enforcement roles, to assist states where the ranks of poll workers have been depleted by the coronavirus pandemic. Those troops are doing cybersecurity and routine election tasks like opening mail-in ballots. As of last week 10 states had activated the National Guard to help with election tasks and 14 more are expected to activate troops this week.

New Jersey and Wisconsin have both called up hundreds of citizen soldiers and airmen to work the elections. In both states, the troops helping out are wearing civilian clothes so that voters will not be alarmed by seeing camouflage uniforms at the polls.

“It creates a sense of normalcy,” said Major Joe Trovato, a spokesman for the Wisconsin National Guard. “We’re not trying to alarm anyone; we are just trying to support the election.”

But in a year that is anything but normal, with the electorate sharply polarized, the president warning supporters of a stolen election, and gun sales through the roof, states are bracing for violence that may overwhelm local law enforcement and bring uniformed military troops into the streets.

Legal experts say the election may complicate the response because the president has broad discretion to sidestep legal restrictions by declaring an insurrection, which would allow him not only to take control of state National Guard troops, but also to deploy the Army or Marines.

If the president decides unrest rises to the level of insurrection, there is little Congress or the courts can do to stop him, legal experts say.

“The law is so broadly written that the president gets to decide what’s an insurrection, and there is not much local authorities or anyone else can do to stop it,” said Rachel VanLandingham, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who now teaches national security law at Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles.

President Trump has not indicated he will deploy troops after the election. If he did, legal scholars and historians said it would be highly unusual. But just a few months ago, the president signaled he was willing to use the Insurrection Act to send in federal troops amid widespread protests over abusive policing. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,” he said in June.

But at the same time Mr. Trump threatened to deploy active-duty troops, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, argued against such a move to control the wave of protests in American cities, including Washington, at least at that time. Mr. Esper said at a Pentagon news conference that deploying active-duty forces in a domestic law enforcement role “should only be used as a matter of last resort and only in the most urgent and dire of situations.”

A federal law known as the Posse Comitatus Act prohibits federal troops from engaging in domestic law enforcement, leaving that role instead to state National Guard forces.

“The founding fathers were wary of having an army interfere in the new republic, so they placed the authority for law enforcement with the states,” Ms. VanLandingham said. Governors long relied on state militias when local authorities were overwhelmed. Those militias in 1903 were organized as the National Guard but still remain under the control of governors unless they are federalized for a national emergency.

Governors have mobilized Guard forces frequently in recent months to respond to protests over violent policing, as well as hurricanes and wildfires. In June, during the height of the protests, about 86,000 Guard troops were deployed in domestic missions.

Some governors have put troops on standby this week for the election, including Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, who The San Antonio Express-News reported had dispatched 1,000 Guard troops to major cities in anticipation of violence.

While federal law bars using federal troops, that restriction can be lifted by the president under the Insurrection Act, which allows the president to send in armed forces if he decides local authorities are not enforcing the laws of the United States. This has happened amid labor strikes and conflicts with Native Americans and to enforce school desegregation. The last time the act was used was in 1992, when riots in Los Angeles broke out after four white police officers were acquitted in the beating of Rodney King, a Black motorist.

The Insurrection Act could complicate the response to civil unrest, Ms. VanLandingham said, because mayors and governors have no say in what is classified as insurrection, so troops could be sent in even if local authorities do not think they are needed.

Federal troops have not been used to guard against election violence since the years after the Civil War when the Army was stationed across the South to put down the Ku Klux Klan and protect Black voters, said Joshua Kastenberg, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel and military judge who teaches military law at the University of New Mexico School of Law.

“Presidents have historically been very reluctant to call out the Army. They’ve used the authority briefly and responsibly,” he said. But, he cautioned, there are almost no checks on the president’s power to send in troops. Challenges in the courts are so slow that they are often decided long after an executive order is carried out, he said, and Congress has no standing to challenge what the White House deems an insurrection.

“A president could issue a ridiculous insurrection proclamation or violate the Posse Comitatus Act, and the people would have very little recourse,” he said.

"As Election Day Arrives, Trump Shifts Between Combativeness and Grievance","President Trump arrives at Election Day on Tuesday toggling between confidence and exasperation, bravado and grievance, and marinating in frustration that he is trailing Joseph R. Biden Jr., whom he considers an unworthy opponent.

“Man, it’s going to be embarrassing if I lose to this guy,” Mr. Trump has told advisers, a lament he has aired publicly as well. But in the off-camera version, Mr. Trump frequently exclaims, “This guy!” in reference to Mr. Biden, with a salty adjective separating the words.

Trailing in most polls, Mr. Trump has careened through a marathon series of rallies in the last week, trying to tear down Mr. Biden and energize his supporters, but also fixated on crowd size and targeting perceived enemies like the news media and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the federal government’s infectious disease expert whom he suggested on Sunday he might try to dismiss after the election.

At every turn, the president has railed that the voting system is rigged against him and has threatened to sue when the election is over, in an obvious bid to undermine an electoral process strained by the coronavirus pandemic. It is not clear, however, precisely what legal instruments Mr. Trump believes he has at his disposal.

The president, his associates say, has drawn encouragement from his larger audiences and from a stream of relatively upbeat polling information that advisers have curated for him, typically filtering out the bleakest numbers.

On a trip to Florida last week, several aides told the president that winning the Electoral College was a certainty, a prognosis not supported by Republican or Democratic polling, according to people familiar with the conversation. And Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, has responded with chipper enthusiasm when Mr. Trump has raised the idea of making a late bid for solidly Democratic states like New Mexico, an option other aides have told the president is flatly unrealistic.

His mad dash to the finish is a distillation of his four tumultuous years in office, a mix of resentment, combativeness and a penchant for viewing events through a prism all his own — and perhaps the hope that everything will work out for him in the end, the way it did four years ago when he surprised himself, his advisers and the world by winning the White House.

But by enclosing himself in the thin bubble of his own worldview, Mr. Trump may have further severed himself from the political realities of a country in crisis. And that, in turn, has helped enable Mr. Trump to wage a campaign offering no central message, no clear agenda for a second term and no answer to the woes of the pandemic.

Most people in the president’s inner circle share his optimism about the outcome of the race, even as they fight exhaustion and the president’s whipsawing moods, interviews with more than a dozen aides and allies showed. But some advisers acknowledge that it would require several factors to fall into place. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal deliberations.

Republican lawmakers have offered less rosy assessments of his prospects, and in private some Trump advisers do not argue the point. One high-ranking Republican member of Congress vented to Mr. Meadows last month that if Mr. Trump “is trying to lose the election I can’t think of anything I’d tell him to do differently,” the lawmaker recalled, noting that the aide only nodded his head in acknowledgment. “They just think they can’t do anything about it.”

Beyond the capital, though, some Republicans insist that Mr. Trump can again defy the odds, and that a devoted base will fuel a traditional G.O.P. surge in Election Day voters.

Joe Gruters, the chairman of the Republican Party of Florida who appeared with Mr. Trump in Tampa last week, described the president as “a lock” in the state.

“You can take it to the bank and cash the check,” Mr. Gruters said, adding of the Democrats: “We’re crushing them on the ground. That’s what’s going to make the difference.”

Seldom far from Mr. Trump’s thoughts, however, is the possibility of defeat — and the potential consequences of being ejected from the White House.

In unguarded moments, Mr. Trump has for weeks told advisers that he expects to face intensifying scrutiny from prosecutors if he loses. He is concerned not only about existing investigations in New York, but the potential for new federal probes as well, according to people who have spoken with him.

While Mr. Trump has not aired those worries in the open, he has railed against the democratic process, raising baseless doubts about the integrity of the vote.

He has also mused about prematurely declaring victory Tuesday night, but if there’s any organized plan to do so his top lieutenants are not conveying it to their allies. One congressional strategist said that he spoke to Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, on Sunday and that Mr. Kushner not only didn’t ask for buy-in from Capitol Hill Republicans for such a plan but also didn’t mention the prospect at all.

Mr. Trump’s advisers do continue to believe he has a realistic chance of besting Mr. Biden, but they concede it would take a last-minute breakthrough in one of the Great Lakes states where he is currently trailing. Some Republicans, however, are already bracing for losses or close calls in a series of Sun Belt states — and expressing alarm that Mr. Trump may have turned some of them prematurely blue in the same fashion that Barack Obama’s 2008 landslide made Virginia and Colorado Democratic bulwarks.

“Arizona and Georgia are a big deal,” said Nick Everhart, a Republican strategist. “That’s a shift people thought would come but once they’re gone they’re hard to reel back.”

The president himself has done little to strengthen his chances in the final days of the race. On Friday, Mr. Trump used a rally in Michigan to float a baseless theory that doctors are classifying patients’ deaths as related to the coronavirus in order to make more money, drawing fierce condemnation from medical groups, as well as Mr. Biden and Mr. Obama.

And on Saturday, in Pennsylvania at the site where George Washington mapped out his Delaware crossing during the Revolution, aides wrote out a sober speech for the president to deliver. Midway through, he seemed to get bored and began to riff about the size of Mr. Biden’s sunglasses.

He has frequently used his speeches to deliver long diatribes against Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, even though some Trump advisers believe the whole subject is a sideshow in the midst of a public-health disaster. But Trump associates say he simply enjoys attacking the Biden family.

Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican from North Dakota, said that he believed Mr. Trump did not let the possibility of losing interfere with his approach.

“He certainly isn’t going to buy into anybody’s argument that it’s all over or that he’s lost,” Mr. Cramer said.

What confounds some Republicans is how little Mr. Trump is discussing last month’s confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court; some G.O.P. senators have made that achievement a centerpiece of their campaigns.

Campaigning in Kentucky this weekend in pursuit of his seventh term, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, repeatedly trumpeted Justice Barrett and the other two Trump-nominated judges on the high court while not mentioning Mr. Biden’s name once.

Though Mr. Trump has reconstituted parts of his 2016 inner circle in the waning days of the race, the operation lacks a figure who is both willing and able to force the president to stick to a script. Four years ago, Mr. Trump viewed the campaign’s top official, Stephen K. Bannon, as something of a peer— one who was able to focus the candidate. These days, Mr. Trump often rages to associates and aides that he believes they are failing him.

There was a fleeting effort to bring in a new voice as recently as three weeks before the election: Some Trump advisers floated the idea of recruiting Karl Rove, the former George W. Bush adviser, who has been involved in a super PAC supporting Mr. Trump, or someone like him.But by the time that idea was discussed the election was already less than a month away. Some Republicans appear to be looking past the end of the Trump era, whether that comes on Tuesday night or in another few years.

Several ambitious young Republicans have recently made visits to the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire, including Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota. Ms. Noem also quietly visited Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago, which may become another stop on the G.O.P. primary circuit should Mr. Trump lose. Another, Senator Rick Scott of Florida, is maneuvering to take over the National Republican Senatorial Committee, an effort seen by other Republicans as a step toward running for president.

There is even quiet lobbying underway for the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee, a body helmed for four years by Ronna McDaniel.

Several Trump loyalists are seen as potential successors in that job, including David Bossie, who is an R.N.C. member from Maryland, as well as the Ohio Republican Party chairwoman, Jane Timken, whom the president effectively installed in her post. Mr. Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. and his girlfriend, the conservative pundit Kimberly Guilfoyle, have both been discussed as possible chair, though their aides said they are not interested in the job.

Mr. Gruters said he was not aware of any efforts by the president’s son to pursue the R.N.C. job, and praised Ms. McDaniel. But Mr. Gruters said a Trump scion could ascend to the job if she were to step down.

“Ronna has really done well and she certainly deserves the nod if she decides to continue on,” Mr. Gruters said. “Don Jr. obviously would be credible for anything he wanted to go after. He has a solid command of the base. He has the ability to raise a lot of money and would be another superstar for the party.”"
"Long a Republican Stronghold, Arizona Edges Toward Flipping Blue","[Joe Biden has won the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Read our story]

SUN CITY, Ariz. — For months, for years, Democrats have said that 2020 is when Arizona goes blue. But Patti Thompson, who joined fellow Republicans on Saturday in a state party office decorated with cardboard cutouts of Presidents Trump and Ronald Reagan, was not hearing it.

Even before state G.O.P. leaders urged the volunteers to ignore the polls showing that Democrats were ahead in Arizona, Ms. Thompson, a 72-year-old party activist, professed nothing but optimism.

“I’ve never seen energy like we’re seeing now,” she said, dressing to reflect her confidence in a Women for Trump T-shirt emblazoned with an image of a stars-and-stripes stiletto and holding a bedazzled mask in her hand. “People care about saving our country. You can’t let the liberals take power. We cannot let them run our country.”

In a year when energy is hard to see — when Democratic campaign events have been mostly virtual — it is impossible to know whether Ms. Thompson is right.

Yet two years after voters elected the first Democrat to represent the state in the Senate in decades, the question is plain: Can Democrats create the same winning coalition in 2020 as they did in 2018? And is the once reliably Republican state, the birthplace of Barry Goldwater conservatism, on the verge of flipping to a potential bastion for Democrats?

In the past week, both Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, have held rallies in the state. Both campaigns have coordinated staff members and volunteers knocking on millions of doors, with local officials saying it’s the most frenzied political outreach they’ve seen.

That the state is in play at all is a remarkable change. Arizona has not voted for a Democratic candidate for president since Bill Clinton won in 1996, which made him the first Democrat to win the state since Harry Truman.

In some ways, Arizona’s political shift mirrors its demographic one. It has a growing population of younger Latino voters who tend to be more progressive and focused on more liberal immigration policies, universal health care and climate change. Those voters helped Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat, defeat Martha McSally in 2018 to win the seat vacated by Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican. (Mr. Flake famously broke ranks with the president but did not run for re-election to find out whether Arizona voters would punish him for that.)

The optimism among Democrats is also fueled by polling that shows women in the suburbs decisively voting for Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mark Kelly, the Democratic candidate for Senate. Mr. Kelly is running in a special election against Ms. McSally, who was appointed in December 2018 to the Senate seat held for decades by John McCain until his death in August of that year.

State polls also suggest that voters over 65, who have long favored Republicans in the state, are now split between the parties.

“We’ve got more and more people willing to come out of the closet as liberals,” said Phyllis Minsuk, 82, who lives in a retirement community in Goodyear, a suburb near Phoenix, and volunteered for Mr. Kelly. Ms. Minsuk said her local Democratic club had more than quadrupled in size over the past four years. “But even those who won’t declare themselves Democrats, who want to stay secret, they are moving with us. I hear it from them in whispers anywhere I go.”

With 2.6 million voters, Maricopa County is bigger than many states, and is by far the biggest county in Arizona. It’s home to Phoenix and scores of suburbs, and is one of the fastest-growing counties in the country. It was also the largest county in the state to vote for Mr. Trump in 2016, when he received 46 percent of the vote in Maricopa. Roughly 435,000 new voters have registered in the past four years and, as of Sunday, voter turnout in the county — which opened early voting on Oct. 7 — had already exceeded that of 2016.

Still, for all the shifts, a crushing blue wave is not certain for Democrats in a state where independence is seen as virtue of the highest order. Mr. McCain, who long cultivated his image as a maverick, is lionized even by many Democrats. Both Mr. Kelly and Ms. Harris have invoked him on the campaign trail, and his widow, Cindy McCain, has endorsed Mr. Biden. Independent voters make up 31 percent of those registered.

Much as Ms. Sinema did in 2018, Mr. Kelly, who registered as a Democrat only two years ago, has portrayed himself as a moderate independent. Ms. McSally has tried to tie him to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and liberal members of the Democratic Party’s leadership.

“I think the partisanship and the polarization is what has broken Washington and has broken the government,” Mr. Kelly said in an interview on Sunday, after an event to encourage volunteers knocking on doors in Maryvale, a predominantly Latino neighborhood in Phoenix. “I think the only way to solve some of these problems is for both parties to work together.”

Though such an aspiration — and a move toward bipartisanship — may seem impossible at the moment, he pointed to history, singling out both Mr. McCain and Mr. Kelly’s wife, former Representative Gabby Giffords, who had a reputation as a moderate before she resigned after being shot in the head by a constituent in 2011. The couple’s subsequent gun safety advocacy led to the start of Mr. Kelly’s political career.

Mr. Kelly’s emphasis on working across the aisle has not stopped Republicans from trying to portray him, along with Mr. Biden, as tools of the far left. A victory for Mr. Kelly would mean that the state has two Democratic senators for the first time in modern history, which the state’s Republicans are fighting to prevent.

One of their main messages in that fight is that Democrats would “lock us down and open our borders.”

That’s how Mr. Pence put the risks of electing Mr. Biden and Mr. Kelly when he visited Flagstaff, in the northern part of the state, on Friday.

Early in the coronavirus pandemic this spring, when Mr. Trump began pushing to open the economy back up, Arizona was among the first places to do so. Then infection rates exploded and the state eventually had one of the highest per capita rates in the country. Now, people are packing restaurants again even as the curve goes up.

“People are very mindful of who’s going to help us with our economy, get that back on track, ensure that there’s opportunity for families, that people can get kids back to school safely,” Ms. McSally, who campaigned with Gov. Rick Scott of Florida and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in recent days, said in an interview. “When I’m asking them what’s on your mind, they think about how and what are we going to do going forward? How are we going to get the economy going again? People are making choices to keep themselves safe.”

As she fired up her Republican base at volunteer events last weekend, Ms. McSally, who declined to back Mr. Trump in 2016, warned supporters that Arizona was on the verge of becoming like the liberal boogeyman next door: California. At one stop after the next, it was an argument that resonated. (And, indeed, hundreds of Democratic volunteers came from California to knock on doors in the final days.)

“The Democrats have been plotting state by state, precinct by precinct, to take over here for a long time,” said Rich Hale, 71, a lifelong Republican who has lived in the state for more than a decade. “They want to take over coast to coast and then become a totalitarian state. They just see Arizona as a stepping block for the presidency.”

But for some voters, making the state more like California is just what they want to see.

“We have to be more tolerant, more willing to care about decency and each other, and that’s what I think we will get if we get this guy out of office,” said Angel Lopez, a 54-year-old Phoenix resident who drove his 1967 pale yellow Chevy Impala to a “Low Ridin’ for Biden” event in Phoenix on Sunday afternoon. A Dia de los Muertos altar there honored several people who had died from Covid-19 this year. “We’re just letting people get hurt, letting people die, and we have a president who just doesn’t care.”

While Mr. Kelly and other Democrats have tried to make the election a referendum on the president’s handling of the virus, it is unclear whether that will turn voters in their favor. In interviews with dozens of voters across the state in the last week, there was a clear partisan split between those who view the virus as a threat to be feared and those who see it as a nuisance to be dealt with or even ignored.

Ms. Minsuk, the Biden volunteer, said that several of her friends had contracted the virus after attending social gatherings they worried could put them at risk. And when they fell ill, she said, many were too ashamed to tell their friends right away.

Asked whether she or her older friends in Sun City worried about getting sick, Ms. Thompson motioned to the room filled with Republican volunteers and cardboard cutouts of Mr. Trump and Reagan.

“Look around here,” she said. “Two-thirds of the people who are here aren’t wearing masks, so what does that tell you?”

Not long afterward, Ms. McSally led the indoor crowd in singing a rousing rendition of “God Bless America.”"
"At late-night rally, Trump suggests he may fire Fauci ‘after the election.’","President Trump suggested at a rally early Monday morning that he might fire Dr. Anthony S. Fauci after Election Day, further escalating the tension between his administration and the nation’s top infectious disease expert as the number of new coronavirus cases in the United States reaches record highs. 

Mr. Trump spoke well past midnight at the Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport in Florida at his fifth and final rally of the day. At one point, he began reciting a familiar complaint about the news media’s continued coverage of the virus. 

His grousing led the crowd of his supporters to begin chanting, “Fire Fauci! Fire Fauci!” Mr. Trump listened in silence for a few moments before remarking: “Don’t tell anybody, but let me wait until a little bit after the election. I appreciate the advice.”

Crowd chants “Fire Fauci” during Pres. Trump’s campaign rally in South Florida: “Don’t tell anybody, but let me wait until a little a bit  after the election,” the president says in response. “I appreciate the advice.” https://t.co/rlgU1dKT2A pic.twitter.com/Mqa2RwbP3i

The president’s aside came toward the end of what was a whirlwind day of campaigning across five states — Michigan, Iowa, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida — and he spoke even as a local curfew aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus took effect at midnight. On Friday, more than 99,000 coronavirus infections were reported across the country, a single-day record. Nonetheless, Mr. Trump has maintained without citing evidence that the United States has “turned the corner” in fighting the virus, a point he reiterated at the rally early Monday. 

That assertion is strongly disputed by Dr. Fauci, who told the The Washington Post in an interview published on Saturday that the United States “could not possibly be positioned more poorly” as it heads into winter. A White House spokesman later called Dr. Fauci’s comments “unacceptable.” 

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee, has said repeatedly that if he were to win the presidency, he is hopeful Dr. Fauci would remain in his role and serve in his administration.

Mr. Trump’s quip about Dr. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was part of an hourlong mix of meanspirited jokes, misstatements, hyperbole, self-congratulation and occasional on-script arguments he made for his re-election. 

Mr. Trump has adopted Florida as his home turf, and it is a swing state that he desperately needs to win to open paths to another four-year term. Although he narrowly prevailed there in 2016, polls, including one released Sunday by The New York Times and Siena College, have shown him trailing Mr. Biden in a tight race.

Roughly 8.7 million Floridians had already voted as of Sunday, according to the U.S. Elections Project, almost two-thirds of all registered voters in the state. But at least as of Sunday night, turnout among Black and Hispanic voters, both key groups for Democrats, has been lagging in Miami-Dade County, the most populous county in the state. 

In a sign of how important South Florida is to the Biden campaign, Senator Kamala Harris, Mr. Biden’s running mate, visited the region on Saturday, and former President Barack Obama is scheduled to campaign there for Mr. Biden on Monday.

“We win Florida,” Mr. Trump said at the rally, “we win the whole thing.” "
A Stable Race’s Volatile Finish,"As Trump covers the battleground waterfront and Biden tries to avoid another Pennsylvania surprise, the highways have started to feel like the high seas. It’s Monday, and this is your politics tip sheet. Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.

One day before Election Day, which is to say, weeks into Election Season, the presidential polls are pretty consistent with where they’ve been for weeks, with a few notable exceptions. But the anxiety levels, somehow, keep outdoing themselves.

Both the Biden and Trump campaigns are most heavily focused on Pennsylvania, and have visited often for over a month. Joe Biden began a final push there yesterday, with appearances at a “Souls to the Polls” event in the afternoon and a drive-in rally in the evening. President Trump, no doubt needling Biden, will hold a rally today in Scranton, the Democratic nominee’s hometown.

A Monmouth University poll of Pennsylvania released just an hour before this message hit your inbox found Biden holding a lead of seven percentage points among likely voters in a “high-turnout scenario,” as seems likely, and five points in the event of a low-participation election.

Trump gained ground slightly since the previous Monmouth poll among seniors and those living in swing counties, showing that he may be faring well among the very small share of voters who remained undecided until the very last moment.

A New York Times/Siena College poll of Pennsylvania likely voters released yesterday bore a similar result: Biden up by six points. That survey was part of The Times’s last batch of pre-election polls, which also included surveys of Florida, Wisconsin and Arizona. Biden was ahead in all of them, although it was close in Florida, where he held just a three-point edge.

Fighting to make up ground in swing states across the country, Trump traveled to five battlegrounds yesterday — Michigan, Iowa, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida — finishing with a late-night rally in Miami-Dade County.

Biden’s campaign yesterday announced a last blitz of advertising across five media markets in Pennsylvania, drawing upon its strong financial advantage in the homestretch. Last week Biden spent $62 million on TV and radio ads, while the Trump campaign spent only $15.5 million, according to Advertising Analytics.

Biden released a list over the weekend of 817 bundlers, his campaign’s key fund-raising supporters, shedding light on some of the sources of his war chest and drawing another line of demarcation with Trump in the process. The president has not published the identities of his campaign bundlers, something Democrats have done since before the Citizens United Supreme Court decision in 2010.

Biden’s list was full of Wall Street executives, power lawyers and Hollywood producers, as well as his own longtime associates.

In Texas — where the number of ballots cast by late last week had already surpassed the total vote count in 2016 — the State Supreme Court yesterday rejected a Republican effort to throw out more than 120,000 ballots that had been cast at drive-through locations in Harris County, which is heavily Democratic.

The suit centered on 10 voting sites in locations throughout Houston. The plaintiffs, State Representative Steve Toth and Steve Hotze, a conservative activist, said that the Harris County clerk, Chris Hollins, had acted illegally by setting up the sites without having them approved by the State Legislature.

The state court rejected that argument, but a nearly identical case is being heard in federal court, with Judge Andrew Hanen of U.S. District Court, a George W. Bush appointee, set to hear arguments today.

Trump supporters have driven their cars into high-profile incidents throughout his presidency, and the trend has continued as worries about possible election violence rise.

In Texas over the weekend, the president’s supporters surrounded a Biden tour bus on the highway and slowed it down to as low as 25 miles per hour, yelling as they drove and prompting the campaign to cancel two events. Trump shared a video of the incident on Twitter, writing: “I love Texas!” Last night, he added, “These patriots did nothing wrong.”

Trump supporters in New York and New Jersey yesterday gathered for a demonstration on the Mario M. Cuomo Bridge and the Garden State Parkway, jamming up traffic for miles along two of the busiest highways in the New York area.

None of this is nearly as dangerous or as violent as the conduct of James Fields, the white supremacist who drove into a crowd of anti-racist protesters in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017, killing a woman in what the F.B.I. director called an act of domestic terrorism. And it doesn’t quite rise to the level of the president’s backers in Portland, Ore., who sped through the city’s streets in August firing tear gas and paintball guns at protesters on the left who threw objects back at them. That day, a right-wing demonstrator was killed in a violent clash.

But it is part of a growing culture of escalation that has federal law enforcement officials worried about the scenes that could play out in the event of a disputed or delayed election result.

In Graham, N.C., a march to the polls was met by police officers using chemical spray, including on young children, and making numerous arrests. Organizers of the rally called it an act of blatant voter suppression.

“We are very concerned about groups lurking and trying to intimidate voters in particular communities,” said Kristen Clarke, executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a group that works to ensure voting rights. “We want voters to know these sporadic incidents are being addressed, and we want them to be able to cast their ballot.”

Supporters of President Trump gathered in Londonderry, N.H., on Sunday.

BEDFORD, Texas — Texas has, seemingly overnight, flicked an electoral switch.

In a state where one party has dominated for years, and where the Republican primary was once the bellwether election that determined winners and losers, Texas has been watching, slack-jawed, at what happens when a two-party state holds a general election during a presidential race.

Texans have already cast more votes early than they did in the entire 2016 election, with a record-breaking 9.6 million people casting early ballots. There have been long lines at early voting sites in San Antonio, Houston and Austin, not because of polling-place glitches but simply because of demand.

Even the graffiti artists are riled up. One of Houston’s landmarks — a piece of block-letter graffiti reading “Be Someone” on Interstate 45 that has become a civic slogan — was painted over and now declares, “Vote or Die.”

More than 1.4 million people in Harris County, which includes Houston, voted in person and by mail during the early voting period ending Friday, out of a total of 2.4 million registered voters.

What that means is that Democrats, who have benefited from the state’s rising populations of college graduates, younger voters and minorities, are sure to loosen the Republican grip on power in Texas. What no one knows is by how much.

“I’m not surprised to see turnout numbers that are going to exceed 2018 and will probably dwarf any previous Texas election,” said Ted Delisi, a Republican strategist in Austin who was the national field director for former Gov. Rick Perry’s 2012 presidential campaign. “We have a pandemic. We have a presidential election. And we obviously have an activated Democratic Party, and spending on both sides that is completely unprecedented.”

The high turnout was not just a Democratic thing.

In recent days, many of those who have been standing six feet apart outside the library doors in Bedford were fired-up suburban conservatives.

Bedford is part of a chain of Fort Worth suburbs known more by their initials than a name: H.E.B., or Hurst-Euless-Bedford. This had been Tea Party country in the Obama era, but Democrats have chipped away at that support as the region has grown more diverse.

Many voters at the library wore masks and gloves (that’s not just a Democratic thing, either). Some conservative voters were white, but several others were originally from India, including one man who said that he and his wife had rushed back home from overseas to make sure they had time to vote.

One retired electrical engineer who voted for Trump said he blamed the state’s changing politics on the young people who had moved to Texas from California.

And Bonita Herr, a retired pharmacist who lives in Euless and who voted for Trump, said that for her, it was all about the bottom line.

“I don’t want my taxes increased,” she said.

‘It’s Just Crazy’ in Pennsylvania: Mail Voting and the Anxiety That Followed,"KITTANNING, Pa. — “Hello, Elections.”

“Hello, Elections.”

“Hello, Elections.”

The rapid-fire calls were pouring in to Marybeth Kuznik, the one-woman Elections Department of Armstrong County, a few days before Election Day. “This is crazy,” she told an anxious caller. “Crazy, crazy, crazy. It’s a good thing because everybody should vote,” she added, “but it’s just crazy.”

Armstrong County, northeast of Pittsburgh, is one of Pennsylvania’s smaller counties with 44,829 registered voters. But it is a microcosm of the high tension, confusion and deep uncertainty that have accompanied the broad expansion of mail-in voting this year, during an election of passionate intensity.

With all Pennsylvania voters eligible for the first time to vote by mail, more than three million ballots were requested statewide — nearly half the total turnout from 2016. One in five voters in Armstrong County requested a mail-in ballot.

A complicated two-envelope ballot, uncertainty over the reliability of the Postal Service and a glitchy online system for tracking returned votes have caused Ms. Kuznik to be bombarded by callers. And, though to a lesser extent, she has also been visited by a stream of walk-ins at her small second-floor office in the county administration building, where an American flag was stuck into a dying plant above her desk.

“All righty, let’s look you up, see what’s going on,” she told voters who called seeking assistance.

“Gotcha,” she said whenever she found a voter’s name in her Dell computer.

The state-run portal intended to track mail ballots was unreliable, Ms. Kuznik said. By using a database available only to election officials, she was able to reassure voters about the status of a ballot — in nearly all cases, it had been received.

Many callers were alarmed that they had not received a ballot. For some, it was because they had not checked a box on their application for a mail ballot for the primary, asking to receive a general-election mail ballot. “There was a little wee tiny box on there to check,” she told one voter. “Don’t worry about it. Just go and vote.”

She told an upset caller that his ballot had been mailed on Oct. 16, two weeks earlier. “It’s kind of a long time if you haven’t gotten it,” she said. The voter could either visit Ms. Kuznik’s office to have the original ballot canceled and a replacement issued, or vote using a provisional ballot in person on Tuesday.

When the caller complained of not being able to get through to her earlier by phone, Ms. Kuznik said: “Yeah, I apologize, it’s been very, very busy here. But we will get you a ballot. We want you to vote.”

She then helped Beverly Nason, 84, who was waiting behind a swinging half-door and said her 87-year-old husband, William, had not received his ballot.

“Hold on for a minute,” Ms. Kuznik told a phone caller while helping Ms. Nason. “I’m right in the middle of processing a voter, and I will look up and see what’s going on with that.”

As she readied a new ballot to be printed for Mr. Nason, she talked back to a pop-up on her computer: “No, Adobe, I do not want to give a review of this software. No.”

Amanda Wallace, a child-care worker, appeared and asked where to drop off her completed ballot. “Well, that isn’t the whole thing,” Ms. Kuznik told her, explaining that Ms. Wallace, 48, had the inner “secrecy” envelope with her ballot inside but hadn’t brought the outer envelope that she was required to sign. The outer envelope includes a bar code to stop anyone from trying to vote more than once. “You absolutely have to have it in that, or it will not count,” Ms. Kuznik told her.

Sharon Kerr was upset that no ballot had been delivered to her home. It turned out she had entered a post office box for an address. “I can’t fix this today,” Ms. Kuznik told her, “but for right now, I’ll cancel that ballot that was sent out and I’ll get you another one.”

“God bless you, honey,” Ms. Kerr said. “I was worried that mine wouldn’t be counted, and we’ve got to do something. I’m very, very upset with what we have. We need changes.”

Ms. Kuznik, whose job is nonpartisan, did not respond to that, nor to any other comments about candidates. President Trump carried Armstrong County, whose population is almost entirely white and working class, by a margin of more than 16,000 in 2016. Kittanning, the county seat on the Allegheny River, has a population of 4,000. The largest employers are a hospital, government and Walmart.

Many election analysts believe Pennsylvania is the knife’s edge on which the race is balanced, the closest of the three “blue wall” states where Joseph R. Biden Jr., if he sweeps them, has his most likely path to the White House. A New York Times/Siena College poll of Pennsylvania on Sunday showed Mr. Biden with a lead of six percentage points, and a margin of error of 2.4 points.

With more Republicans expected to vote on Election Day and Democrats favoring mail ballots in Pennsylvania, when to count and report results have become partisan flash points. Mr. Trump has demanded, without a basis in law, that the vote leader on election night be named the winner. Democrats are braced for early returns from in-person voters to show a significant Trump lead, with the tide shifting bluer as mail ballots are reported.

Though counties have hired extra workers and in some cases bought machines to rapidly slit envelopes and extract ballots — which they cannot begin to do before 7 a.m. on Nov. 3 — there are wide differences among counties, with some not expecting full results for days.

“No way,” was how Ms. Kuznik responded when asked whether Armstrong County would have all of its votes counted in the hours after polls close at 8 p.m. “We’ll go as quickly as we can, but we’re not going to rush it,” she said. “It’s not the Super Bowl. Nobody’s going to hoist a trophy on election night.”

The state’s largest cities, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, are aiming to report results of mail-in ballots on Tuesday night, according to an aide to a top Democratic official briefed on statewide preparations. But many second-tier counties, including in the Philadelphia suburbs, will be slower. “Erie, Berks, Bucks, Delaware and Lackawanna are real problems,” the aide said. “Their reporting of mail-in votes could go into Wednesday, which will create a lot of election night anxiety.”

Erie County, a swing county that Mr. Trump won in 2016, is expecting about 50,000 mail ballots. Election Day results will be reported first, then starting at 11 p.m., the results from about 10,000 mail ballots will be released, said Carl Anderson III, chair of the Erie County Election Board.

“They’ll still be separating envelopes and ballots on Wednesday, probably Thursday,” he said.

He did not rule out the following Monday for a count of all ballots, including those received in the three days after Election Day that are postmarked by Nov. 3. The secretary of state has ordered counties to segregate ballots received in that window because of potential litigation that has already reached the U.S. Supreme Court.

In Armstrong County, the plan is to open mail ballots and flatten them out in a workroom behind Ms. Kuznik’s office. Workers escorted by sheriff’s deputies will carry the ballots to the public works garage, where the county keeps its scanners.

Ms. Kuznik, who with her mother, Merle Smith Kuznik, had an earlier career running a children’s theater, was named elections director in September.

On Friday, she was preparing to send each polling place a red, white or blue replica of the Liberty Bell, to be rung when someone checked in who was voting for the first time. It was a tradition started by her mother, a longtime judge of elections in a nearby county until her death at 93.

One of Ms. Kuznik’s callers, a woman named Rosanna, was worried that she had not received a ballot.

“Well, Rosanna, what I’m seeing, according to the records here, unfortunately you haven’t voted since 2012,” Ms. Kuznik told her. She explained that her voter registration had been canceled after she missed two federal elections and did not respond to a postcard sent to her.

The voter registration deadline had passed. “After the election, promise me you will call me and we’ll get you a new registration,” Ms. Kuznik said.

Rosanna, who said she had recently retired at 90 from Walmart, began to tell her life’s story.

“Aww,” Ms. Kuznik said at one point.

“Well,” she said at another.

“I don’t want to be mean,” she said finally, “but I have a bunch of people here waiting to get help, so you know maybe, like, why don’t you call me up in January and we’ll have a good long talk?”"
Wisconsin Faces a Challenge: Getting Out the Vote When Most People Have Already Voted,"MILWAUKEE — As Wisconsin weathers the worst coronavirus outbreak of any presidential battleground, the state Democratic Party is calling and texting voters instead of going door to door. The Biden campaign’s get-out-the-vote effort in the state is all virtual.

Stepping into the void to make face-to-face contact with voters are people like Rita Saavedra, who is taking Election Day off from her job as a community relations officer for a local health insurance company so she can drive friends and family members to their polling sites.

“I’m reaching out to everybody I know, all the people who haven’t voted yet,” she said. “I’ll even go to the house and get them out of bed.”

With early voting over and no time left for a mailed ballot to arrive by the Election Day deadline in Wisconsin, the typically herculean task of reminding voters in person to get to the polls and, in many cases, transporting them there, is being left to an informal group of volunteers like Ms. Saavedra, 43. This is happening as the entire infrastructure of the state Democratic Party and Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign is focused on calling and texting the small universe of would-be supporters who still haven’t voted.

The total push toward official online campaigning comes as Wisconsin is experiencing a coronavirus spike unlike any other swing state. The state’s daily average case count was the third-highest in the country per capita over the past week. Only one other presidential battleground, Iowa, is in the top 12.

Absentee turnout in Wisconsin so far amounts to 63 percent of the state’s 2016 electorate. More than half the state’s registered voters have already voted. But there remain thousands of people in vote-rich urban and suburban areas who have yet to cast ballots. 

“It is very weird how we’re going to inevitably have the most volunteers on Election Day, but that gigantic number of volunteers is going to be working to turn out a much smaller number of votes,” said Ben Wikler, the chairman of the Wisconsin Democrats. “There’s a kind of extra return on yard signs and chalk murals and holding a sign near a grocery store and all the things that human beings can do using atoms instead of electrons.”

There is ample evidence that Democratic turnout in Wisconsin has boomed.

Ten counties, including Dane, the state’s most Democratic and the home of Madison, and Milwaukee, the state’s largest, have exceeded 70 percent of their 2016 turnout, according to Wisconsin Election Commission data released on Monday.

At the same time, the state’s 29 counties with the lowest pre-Election Day turnout relative to 2016 are all rural enclaves that voted for President Trump four years ago.

Still, Republicans in the state believe its presidential contest is far closer than public polling suggests. A New York Times and Siena College poll released on Sunday found Mr. Biden had an 11-point advantage over Mr. Trump.

“The Democratic absentee lead has evaporated over the past four to five days as voters in Republican areas have surged to vote early in person,” said Matt Batzel, the executive director of American Majority Action, a conservative group. “I’ve never seen anything like it.”

In Milwaukee, bands spent the past few days driving around the city on the back of flatbed trucks, jamming while holding large “VOTE” signs. In Madison, volunteers who would have knocked on doors to remind people to vote are instead holding signs on busy street corners. At night, the Democratic National Committee is projecting reminders to vote onto the sides of buildings at the University of Wisconsin campuses in both cities.

And instead of big rallies during the final weekend of the campaign, Wisconsin Democrats put on a dizzying number of virtual events that were geared toward die-hard supporters and local media.

Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont spoke at a virtual rally while the party held virtual phone banks that featured local elected officials, musicians, players from the N.B.A.’s Milwaukee Bucks and Pete Souza, the official White House photographer during the Obama administration.

The most prominent out-of-state surrogate campaigning in Wisconsin on Sunday, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, appeared with Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin at events that were not announced to the public, a nod to the state’s deteriorating public health situation.

There is more appetite for canvassing and in-person events in states where the pandemic is somewhat less dire. In Pennsylvania, Democrats spent the weekend block-walking in Philadelphia. Barack Obama campaigned in Michigan on Saturday and was set to hold rallies in Florida and Georgia on Monday. A group called Walk the Vote organized parades to deliver ballots in drop boxes in 48 cities across 12 states over the weekend, but just one parade was in Wisconsin, in the leafy and liberal Milwaukee suburb of Whitefish Bay.

And in Texas, Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, stumped with Gilberto Hinojosa, the state Democratic chairman, while Mr. Hinojosa directed door-to-door canvassing that the Biden campaign has forbidden.

“This is our money, our money is being used to knock doors in all of South Texas,” Mr. Hinojosa said. “This is the gap area where you need to do everything you do to increase the turnout.”

Republicans in Wisconsin have taken a more aggressive approach toward in-person campaigning than their Democratic counterparts. Senator Ron Johnson, Representative Bryan Steil and former Gov. Scott Walker appeared before crowds in Kenosha and at several other campaign stops in southeastern Wisconsin on Saturday. Melania Trump, the first lady, spoke to a crowd in West Bend.

And conservative groups like Mr. Batzel’s have spent the final days of the campaign knocking on tens of thousands of doors trying to convince voters to back both Mr. Trump and Wisconsin’s Republican candidates for the state legislature, who are facing a potential blood bath if Tuesday’s results mirror polling showing Mr. Biden with a sizable lead.

On Friday, Mr. Batzel canvassed in West Allis, a largely white working-class Milwaukee suburb, in a ward where Mr. Trump won 53 percent to Mrs. Clinton’s 40 percent.

Mr. Batzel’s organization is betting there is a competitive advantage to knocking on doors and greeting voters in person, even at a six-foot distance.

During 90 minutes of door-knocking, Mr. Batzel found 13 Trump voters, three people who said they would vote for Mr. Biden and nine people who said they had already voted.

“I usually vote in person, but with Covid I figured I’d stay safe,” said Jodi Hansen, 36, a customer service representative who told Mr. Batzel she had already voted for Mr. Biden.

Later in the afternoon, Rance Frankum, 38, a quality assurance technician, told Mr. Batzel he planned to vote for Mr. Trump at the polls on Election Day.

“I just know that I have no complaints about how the world is under his administration,” Mr. Frankum said.

Milwaukee voters casting ballots on Saturday afternoon at the Tippecanoe branch of the public library expressed varying degrees of exasperation over the onslaught of calls, texts and mail they had been receiving from various parties, campaigns and outside groups.

“I get them every other hour from random people,” said Marilisa Gonzalez, 36, a vice president of a commercial cleaning company. “I don’t read the messages and I have unknown calls blocked.”

For people who haven’t cast their ballots, the calls and texts won’t stop until the polls close on Tuesday night.

“They’re going to be looking around for any phone number that doesn’t have a check mark by it that says, ‘We know they voted,’” said State Senator Janet Bewley, the Democratic leader. “They’re going to keep on calling and calling.”

In Madison, where just 35,587 registered voters in a city of 258,000 have yet to vote, according to the city clerk, Democratic volunteers get through their dwindling lists of locals to contact early each day and spend the rest of their time calling voters in the rest of the state.

“We have the most volunteers and the fewest people left to vote,” said Alexia Sabor, the chairwoman of the Dane County Democrats.

Even Ms. Sabor, who cast her ballot weeks ago, said she still receives multiple texts a day from other liberal groups reminding her to vote. “People are tired of all the texts and calls,” she said.

On Saturday, Ms. Saavedra got a head start on her Tuesday vote-shuttling by driving her nephew Juan A. Saavedra, 19, to vote early for Mr. Biden.

“She got me out of bed and told me I had to vote,” Mr. Saavedra said. “I was going to wait until Tuesday but she wouldn’t let me.”

Ms. Saavedra, who cast her ballot two weeks ago, said she was planning to take at least 10 people to the polls on Tuesday.

“I wouldn’t necessarily pick up a stranger,” she said. “But I have stopped people on the street and asked them, ‘Did you vote yet?’”"
"Win or Lose, Trump and Biden’s Parties Will Plunge Into Uncertainty","[Joe Biden has won the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Read our story]

PLANO, Texas — Facing the toughest race of his Senate career, John Cornyn warned a small crowd of supporters from the second floor of his campaign bus last week that his party’s long-held dominance in this historically ruby-red state was at risk.

But while the three-term Texas senator demonized Democrats at length, he didn’t spend much time talking up the obvious alternative: President Trump, the leader of his party, the man at the top of his ticket on Tuesday.

Asked whether Mr. Trump, the man who redefined Republicanism, was an asset to Mr. Cornyn’s re-election effort, the senator was suddenly short on words.

“Absolutely,” he said, stone-faced.

Mr. Cornyn’s gentle distancing from Mr. Trump foreshadows a far less genteel battle to come. This year’s election seems likely to plunge both Republicans and Democrats into a period of disarray no matter who wins the White House. With moderates and progressives poised to battle each other on the left, and an array of forces looking to chart a post-Trump future on the right (be it in 2021 or in four years), both parties appear destined for an ideological wilderness in the months ahead as each tries to sort out its identities and priorities.

The questions facing partisans on both sides are sweeping, and remain largely unresolved despite more than a year of a tumultuous presidential campaign. After Democrats cast their eyes backward several generations for a more moderate nominee, does a rising liberal wing represent their future? And what becomes of a Republican Party that has been redefined by the president’s populist approach, and politicians like Mr. Cornyn who have been in the long shadow of Mr. Trump for four years?

Traditionally, presidential elections provide clarity on how a party sees its political future. When Barack Obama won the White House in 2008, he reinvigorated a progressive public image of his increasingly diverse party. Eight years earlier, George W. Bush remade Republicanism with a message of “compassionate conservatism.”

Today, with both presidential candidates content to make the race a referendum on Mr. Trump, questions about him have overshadowed the debates raging within both parties over how to govern a country in the midst of a national crisis.

“Both sides have been content to make this election about a personality,” said Brad Todd, a Republican strategist and an author of a book about the conservative populist coalition that fueled Mr. Trump’s victory in 2016. “Therefore, we’ve not had a lot of light shown on the ideological realignment that’s occurred in the country.”

The jockeying has already begun. If Mr. Biden wins, progressive Democrats are preparing to break their election-season truce, laying plans to push for liberals in key government posts, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as Treasury secretary. If Mr. Biden loses, progressives will argue that he failed to embrace a liberal enough platform.

Ambitious Republicans, like the former United Nations ambassador Nikki R. Haley, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, have begun appearing in Iowa, stops that they say are on behalf of their party’s embattled Senate candidate there but that have distinctly 2024 overtones.

“The party is headed toward a reckoning, whatever happens in November, because you still have large segments of the party establishment that are not at all reconciled with the president’s victory in 2016,” said Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, who is frequently mentioned as a possible 2024 contender. “These people are still very powerful in the Republican Party, and I think we’ll have a real fight for the future.”

The emerging dynamics are particularly stark across in Texas and other states in the Sun Belt, a fast-growing region that embodies the demographic trends that will eventually reshape the nation.

For Republicans like Mr. Cornyn, the battle lines are already being drawn. Four years ago, Mr. Trump mounted a hostile takeover of the Republican Party, winning the support of the party’s base with a message that shredded mainstream conservative ideology on issues like fiscal responsibility, foreign policy and trade.

A contingent of the party’s old guard is eager to cast the president as an aberration, a detour into nationalism, populism and conspiracy theories with no serious policy underpinning.

Former Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said that he expected Mr. Trump to lose and that he hoped the defeat would refocus the party from “anger and resentment” to developing an inclusive message that could win in an increasingly diverse country.

“Nothing focuses the mind like a big election loss,” said Mr. Flake, who was one of many Republicans to retire in 2018 and who has endorsed Mr. Biden for president. “The bigger the better when it comes to the president.”

He added, “Trumpism is a demographic cul-de-sac.”

Mr. Flake would like the party to resurrect its 2012 “autopsy,” an assessment commissioned by the Republican National Committee to explore why the party had lost its bid for the White House that year. The report urged the party to better embrace voters of color and women.

A co-chair of the project, Ari Fleischer, said there was no returning to the days of that message. Mr. Trump, he said, had accomplished the goal of the report, expanding the party — just in a different way.

Rather than engage women or voters of color, the president expanded Republican margins with white, working-class voters, said Mr. Fleischer, a former press secretary for Mr. Bush who has come to embrace Mr. Trump after leaving his ballot blank in 2016.

Sara Fagen, who was the White House political director for Mr. Bush, agreed: “Trumpism is cemented in,” she said. “The base of the party has changed; their priorities are different than where the Romneys and Bushes would have taken the country.”

Mr. Hawley argued that Republicans should embrace the populist energy of their voters by pursuing the breakup of big technology companies, voicing skepticism of free trade and making colleges more accountable for their high tuition costs.

“If the party is going to have a future, it’s got to become the party of working people,” he said.

Texas may provide a preview of these debates. As Democrats continue to make gains in the state and as the coronavirus rages there, moderate Republicans have tried to steer the state closer to the center while conservatives have tried to push Texas further right.

Hard-line Republican legislators, lawyers and activists have sued Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, formally censured him and protested mandates like a statewide mask order. Over the summer, the party elected a new chairman, Allen B. West, a former Florida congressman and firebrand conservative.

“The governor has continued to issue executive orders that are anything but conservative,” said Jared Woodfill, a conservative activist and Houston lawyer who has sued Mr. Abbott. “His base has left him completely.”

Democrats face their own divides over whether to use the moment of national crisis to push for far-reaching structural changes on issues like health care, economic inequality and climate change.

Like Republicans in 2012, Democrats assembled their own task force to try to unify their party after the crowded party primary this year. The group came up with recommendations that were largely broader than what Mr. Biden championed in his primary bid but that stopped short of embracing key progressive policies like “Medicare for all,” the Green New Deal and a fracking ban.

Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, a co-chair of the House Progressive Caucus and an ally of Senator Bernie Sanders, said those plans were the “floor, not the ceiling” of what the liberal wing of the party plans to demand should Mr. Biden win. A White House victory, she argued, would give Mr. Biden a mandate to push for more sweeping overhauls.

In Texas, a rising number of young, liberal politicians believe they can finally turn the conservative state blue by embracing a progressive platform.

Two years ago, Julie Oliver lost a House race in Texas’ 25th Congressional District, based in suburban Austin, by nine percentage points — a far closer margin than the 20 points that Representative Roger Williams, a Republican, won by in 2016. This year, the race may be even tighter.

“The things we are talking about two years ago that seemed radical don’t seem so radical today,” said Ms. Oliver, who was endorsed by Mr. Biden last month. “Universal health care doesn’t seem radical. Universal basic income doesn’t seem so radical. These are popular ideas.”

Others in the state worry that their colleagues are forgetting the lessons of recent history. In 2008, Democrats won control of Congress and the White House. But after passing the Affordable Care Act and pushing a climate bill through the House, they lost seats during the midterm elections and their majority in the House.

“We got to remember, midterms are coming,” said Representative Henry Cuellar, a moderate Democrat from South Texas. “If liberals had a mandate, then Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren would have won the primary. The mandate of the American public was to have somebody more to the center.”

Yet in an increasingly polarized country, that center may be shifting.

As he waited for Mr. Cornyn to address the crowd in Plano, Mark Wurst said he had come to embrace the Trump brand of conservatism.

A lifelong Republican, Mr. Wurst, 74, volunteered at the George W. Bush Presidential Library for years. He was skeptical of Mr. Trump initially but was impressed with his actions on immigration and trade — policies that diverged drastically from Mr. Bush’s approach.

“I didn’t know at the time how much I really disagreed with Bush on some things,” Mr. Wurst said. “Look at what Mr. Trump has gotten done. I don’t like his tone, but sometimes you have to look at results.”"
"Texas Supreme Court Denies G.O.P. Push to Throw Out 127,000 Votes","The Texas Supreme Court on Sunday denied an effort by Republicans to throw out more than 120,000 votes that had already been cast at drive-through locations in Harris County, leaving Republicans’ only remaining option at the federal level.

The ruling from the court came without comment.

The effort to get rid of the votes from Harris County, which includes Houston and is largely Democratic, now hinges on a nearly identical effort at the federal level, where a judge has called an election-eve hearing for Monday.

The lawsuit contends that the 10 drive-through voting sites in Houston, the nation’s fourth-largest city, are operating illegally and are arranged in locations that favor Democrats.

The system was put in place for the first time this year by Chris Hollins, the Harris County clerk, with unanimous approval by county commissioners, after being tested in a pilot program over the summer.

More than 127,000 voters have cast ballots at the sites, and the number could grow to more than 135,000 through Election Day on Tuesday, said Susan Hays, a lawyer for Harris County. She said county officials planned to vigorously challenge the suit, which she described as an act of “voter suppression.”

“It’s nuts,” she said. “Votes should count.”

Democrats were hopeful on Sunday that the decision from the all-Republican Texas Supreme Court would bode well for their battle at the federal level.

The case will be heard on Monday morning by Judge Andrew S. Hanen of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, who was appointed by President George W. Bush.

In a motion on Friday asking to intervene in the case, Democrats said it threatened to “throw Texas’ election into chaos by invalidating the votes of more than 100,000 eligible Texas voters who cast their ballots” at the drive-through sites. The motion was filed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the campaign of M.J. Hegar, a Democratic candidate for the Senate in Texas.

The plaintiffs, who include State Representative Steve Toth and the conservative activist Steve Hotze, argue that drive-through voting “is a violation of state and federal law and must be stopped.”

In a telephone interview on Saturday, Mr. Toth said that only the Legislature had the authority to put in place a drive-though voting system. He also said the arrangement of the sites was tilted toward Democratic voters, noting that Mr. Hollins is vice chairman of finance for the Texas Democratic Party.

“If Hollins is really concerned that everybody is accurately represented, why is it that nine of the 10 are set up in predominantly Democratic areas?” said Mr. Toth, who represents part of neighboring Montgomery County.

He denied that the lawsuit was aimed at blunting Democratic momentum amid record rates of early voting in Houston and other strongly Democratic areas in the last days before the election.

“We’re not the ones who are disenfranchising anybody,” he said. “This is Hollins who did this.”

In a statement on Twitter on Saturday, Mr. Hollins said drive-through voting was “a safe, secure and convenient way to vote,” adding: “Texas Election Code allows it, the Secretary of State approved it, and 127,000 voters from all walks of life have used it.”

He said that his office was “committed to counting every vote cast by registered voters in this election,” and that voters would be notified if court proceedings required them to take any additional steps."
"In Texas, the Polls Open for a Graveyard Shift","HOUSTON — Felix Sylvester drove straight to the polling site after work and cast his ballot in a matter of minutes. There was no line, perhaps because it was a few minutes past 3 a.m.

The parking lot was lit up in the predawn darkness by towering light poles. Most of Houston was asleep — most, but not all. Mr. Sylvester, 65, voted early Friday at one of eight polling places across Harris County that, five days before the election, stayed open all night. For him, it was about more than convenience; it was probably the difference between voting and not voting.

Mr. Sylvester works at a grain elevator on the Houston Ship Channel. He had been working eight-hour and 12-hour shifts that made it almost impossible to cast a ballot during Texas’ early voting period, during which the polls have typically been open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.

“It would have been difficult, because if I work nights, I’m sleeping during the day,” he said. It happened that 3 a.m. was one time that worked for him.

The 2020 election now has something in common with 7-Eleven: 24-hour service.

From 7 a.m. Thursday to 7 p.m. Friday, the eight polling sites gave new meaning to the notion of early voting, operating in the cities of Houston, Pasadena and Cypress. Voters in the third-most-populous county in America cast their ballots at 2 a.m. as if it were 2 p.m., part of a push by officials in the predominantly Democratic county to expand voter access in the midst of a pandemic during the three-week early-voting period, which ended Friday.

The numbers made it clear that it was not a mere gimmick. At the peak nighttime hours — from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. — 10,250 people voted at the eight locations. More than 800 of those voters cast their ballots between midnight and 7 a.m., election officials said.

The late-night voters were college students and retirees, men and women, gay and straight, parents who brought their children and workers who walked in still wearing their work ID lanyards and nameplates.

Leslie Johnson, 29, who works for an oil-services company, finished work, went to the wrong polling site and finally voted at an overnight location shortly after 7 p.m. Richard Munive, 33, a bar back who is the son of a Colombian immigrant, clocked out around 1:30 a.m., switched out of his work shoes and voted by 2:30 a.m., a few hours before he started his second job at a T-shirt printing warehouse.

At three overnight polling sites, it was democracy in action, in the dark. The locations were near the old Astrodome at the NRG Park stadium complex, the Tracy Gee Community Center in a diverse neighborhood north of Chinatown and a facility in a historically Black neighborhood called Kashmere Gardens.

Many of the voters at those polling places were Black, Hispanic or Asian, and the vast majority said they were Democrats who had voted for Joseph R. Biden Jr. for president. Some said they had headed to the polls at nighttime, when they could, because they did not want to miss what could be a historic election that might change the political landscape of Texas. Others said it was simply because they almost always work late or stay up late, and the polls in Texas never do.

Mr. Sylvester, who is originally from the Caribbean island of Trinidad, finished work at about 2 a.m. and headed to the polls after hearing on the news about the 24-hour voting. Asked whom he supported for president, Mr. Sylvester chuckled.

It was too late for politics. Or too early.

“I voted for the winner,” he said.

Malea Hardeman, 24, has the type of job that rarely fits into a 7 a.m.-to-7 p.m. schedule. So she was thrilled to be able to vote at 11:30 p.m.

“It really took the stress off of trying to figure out where to fit it in,” Ms. Hardeman said after voting. “I’m a doula, so my work hours are completely random. Because babies are all the time.”

Ms. Hardeman voted at an all-night location at NRG Arena. A drive-in concert nearby, organized by the Move Texas civic engagement group to draw people to the nighttime polls, had just ended.

The concert headliner was a Houston rap superstar, Bun B. For many in the audience, there was another superstar at the show — the young man responsible for 24-hour voting, Chris Hollins, the top election official in Harris County.

Mr. Hollins, 34, is the youngest and the first Black clerk of Harris County. He has pushed to make it easier to vote during the pandemic, tripling the number of early-voting sites and opening drive-through voting locations. The all-night voting event was the first time in Texas history polls were open 24 hours.

For years, Texas Republican leaders have fought to toughen the state’s voting rules, passing a voter ID law and other measures. The initiatives led by Mr. Hollins, a Democrat, have been challenged in court by Republican officials and conservative activists. Despite those legal battles, turnout in Harris County surpassed the 2016 early-vote total; 1.4 million people voted in person or by mail during the early voting period that ended Friday. Across Texas, more early ballots were cast this year than the entire number cast in 2016.

“There are a lot of folks in this county and around this country who work nontraditional hours and live nontraditional hours, and for good reason,” Mr. Hollins said. “On one night, we’re giving them the opportunity to cast a vote at a time that’s convenient for them.”

The late-night polling site in west Houston near the Chinatown neighborhood had what none of the others had: free tacos.

State Representative Gene Wu, a Houston Democrat, had arranged and paid for Boombox Taco to park its truck in a community center parking lot and serve voters. People stood by the truck with plates of tacos on an unusually cold Houston night, lingering after voting.

Jovany Ramirez, 19, was still wearing his Burger King uniform when he voted at about 1 a.m. Carlos Davis, 41, was in his nurse’s apparel.

“Just like with health care, there’s nothing like access,” Mr. Davis said. “If you don’t have access, you have nothing.”

As any A.T.M. manager will tell you, sometimes things are busy long past midnight. And sometimes things are yawn-inducingly slow.

After Mr. Sylvester voted at 3 a.m. at a community center in Kashmere Gardens, the minutes ticked by with nary a sound, and zero voters.

And then, shortly before 4 a.m., up pulled Brittany Hayes, 33, a small trove of virus masks dangling from the rearview mirror. She, too, went in and out within minutes.

“I work at night, and I typically get off at 9:30, so the polls are closed,” said Ms. Hayes, a customer-service representative and mother of two who described herself as a night owl, as is, she said, her 1-year-old. “I always vote. I feel like this is a way for our voices to be heard.”

The parking lot was frigid. Ms. Hayes wrapped herself, right after voting but long before the dawn’s early light, in the Stars and Stripes blanket she keeps in her car."
"Both Candidates Agree: Trump’s Crowds Are Bigger, and They’re OK With That","WASHINGTON — For President Trump, the only thing that really matters is the size of his crowds. For Joseph R. Biden Jr., the road to the White House is full of honking cars.

As the two candidates for president closed out the final weekend of the 2020 campaign, which is unfolding in the middle of a health crisis, their venues not only contrasted their radically different positions on the coronavirus pandemic but offered revealing windows into the core of their political identities.

Mr. Trump is defined by his obsession with the size of his rallies, an almost inevitable bookend to his boastful exaggerations about the number of people who attended his inauguration four years ago. For the president, campaigning is a show, and its success is defined by the ratings that come with it: the crowds.

Mr. Biden has abandoned that instinct for large turnout in favor of drive-in rallies that underscore a central message of his campaign: that he will be more responsible than Mr. Trump in the face of a deadly pandemic. Mr. Biden’s socially distanced rallies, which draw hundreds, not thousands, of people in their vehicles, are the physical manifestation of his willingness to sacrifice numbers for safety.

Both men put those competing identities on display as they dashed across battleground states over the weekend.

Mr. Trump was holding rallies in five states on Sunday after spending a full day in Pennsylvania on Saturday. As he crisscrossed the country, the president repeatedly marveled at the thousands of people who had turned out to see him and viciously mocked the smaller gatherings for his Democratic rival.

“And then you’d have like two cars honk — honk, honk,” Mr. Trump said in Washington, Mich., on Sunday, as he complained repeatedly about the cold wind and the snow that fell throughout his remarks.

Mr. Trump bragged about attracting bigger crowds than Mr. Biden and former President Barack Obama, who campaigned together on Saturday. “I hate to say it, Obama doesn’t draw any better,” he said. “They went as a twosome and they had less people.”

Mr. Trump enters his rallies to pounding music and crowds roaring their approval — with few people wearing masks — as he throws Make America Great Again hats into the stands like T-shirts at a basketball game. Aides say that he feeds off the energy of his audiences, and that the rallies have convinced Mr. Trump that he will win despite polls showing him trailing in almost all of the competitive states.

“A great red wave is forming,” Mr. Trump said on Saturday in Newtown, Pa. “As sure as we’re here together, that wave is forming. And they see it, they see it on all sides, and there’s not a thing they can do about it.”

Jason Miller, a senior adviser for Mr. Trump’s campaign, said the president “loves campaigning” and is always eager for “the input from people outside the Beltway.”

But Mr. Trump is less enthusiastic when the input comes from smaller crowds. On Saturday morning, as he spoke to only about 300 people at his first Pennsylvania rally of the day, Mr. Trump was lethargic and subdued, as if he were privately thinking to himself: Yawn.

The night before, the president stalked off the stage in Rochester, Minn., after speaking for less than 30 minutes before a tiny crowd in a state where gatherings are limited to no more than 250 people. Mr. Trump claimed that there were “at least 25,000 people who wanted to be here tonight,” and said that his supporters were “barred from entry by radical Democrats.”

On Sunday, Mr. Trump also had rallies scheduled in Dubuque, Iowa; Hickory, N.C.; Rome, Ga.; and Opa-locka, Fla. — the last one at 11 p.m.

Mr. Biden held campaign events in Michigan on Saturday and in Pennsylvania on Sunday, but with a twist: His supporters attend his rallies in their cars to ensure social distancing in the midst of the pandemic.

On a rainy Sunday evening in Philadelphia, Mr. Biden addressed supporters at a park where cars were parked on a muddy field. Earlier in the day, he appeared at another drive-in event outside a church in the city. And on Saturday, Mr. Obama joined him for drive-in rallies in Flint, Mich., and Detroit.

At the event in Flint, Mr. Obama mocked his successor for his “obsession” with crowd size, asking: “Did no one come to his birthday party when he was a kid? Was he traumatized?” He cited a recent study by Stanford researchers estimating that rallies held by Mr. Trump had resulted in tens of thousands of new coronavirus cases.

Mr. Biden has also faulted Mr. Trump for endangering his own supporters.

“I’m being responsible and I’m not becoming a great spreader of Covid,” Mr. Biden said last week, making explicit the distinction that he has been trying to draw for months. Mr. Trump, he said, is “putting thousands of people at risk.”

Mr. Biden’s drive-in rallies may be a campaign trail novelty, but they provide a way for his campaign to excite supporters in key areas and attract local news media coverage, much like a traditional rally would, while also observing public-health precautions.

“It’s a great way to show the enthusiasm and get the feeling of a campaign while being Covid safe,” said Jenn Ridder, the national states director for the Biden campaign. “People love them. They love the honking and the noise. I think people want to feel part of something, and especially in Covid.”

The drive-in events have smaller audiences than the big rallies that would be expected at the end of a typical presidential campaign. About 180 cars were on hand for the Flint rally, for example, while the rally in Detroit had 450 cars. 

But the format allows for something that has been missing when Mr. Biden gives speeches during the pandemic in front of small groups of reporters: audible feedback from the crowd, even if it is different from the applause at Mr. Trump’s rallies.

“The horns can be really cool as far as call and response,” said Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II of Michigan, who spoke at the rallies in Flint and Detroit. “You have people kind of sitting on top of their cars, or hanging out the window.”

“It kind of personifies this campaign,” Mr. Gilchrist added. “Joe Biden is a person who values human connection.”

Mr. Biden has played off the format at times. “Honk if you want America to lead again,” he said in Philadelphia. “Honk if you want Americans to begin to trust each other again. And honk if you want America to be united again.”

The crowd responded with a burst of beeping.

For attendees, it is a new experience, and they have different approaches to taking in the proceedings. Some people stay inside their cars, allowing easy access to honking. Others stand near their cars, a position that allows for sign hoisting or flag waving. Some open their car doors and stand in the doorways, giving them better views. Still more sit on their roofs, providing the highest vantage point of all.

The rallies also offer a unique opportunity for artistic expression, with voters decorating their cars to show their support for Mr. Biden. At a drive-in rally at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines on Friday, Nancy Bobo, 68, plastered her S.U.V. with signs, some of them homemade.

Only after she made the signs did she realize she had made a mistake on one of them. It was the kind of mistake that could be made only in preparation for a Biden rally: She misspelled “malarkey” on a sign that declared, “No more malarky!”

Michael D. Shear reported from Washington, and Thomas Kaplan from Flint, Mich."
Trump Backers Block Highways as Election Tensions Play Out in the Streets,"Vehicles with Trump flags halted traffic on Sunday on the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey and jammed the Mario M. Cuomo Bridge between Tarrytown and Nyack, N.Y. Another pro-Trump convoy in Virginia ended in a tense shouting match with protesters as it approached a statue of Robert E. Lee in Richmond. 

In Georgia, a rally for Democrats was canceled shortly before it was scheduled to begin on Sunday, with organizers worried about what they feared would be a “large militia presence” drawn by President Trump’s own event nearby.

As the nation races toward Election Day, the tensions and acrimony surrounding an extraordinarily divisive campaign, coming on the heels of a summer of protests and racial unrest, are bleeding into everyday life and adding further uncertainty to an electoral process in which Mr. Trump has not committed to a peaceful transfer of power. 

Sunday’s incidents came a day after a group of Trump supporters in Texas, driving trucks and waving Trump flags, surrounded and slowed a Biden-Harris campaign bus as it drove on Interstate 35, leading to the cancellation of two planned rallies. The F.B.I. confirmed on Sunday that it was investigating the incident.

On Saturday, President Trump tweeted a video of the incident with a message, “I love Texas!” After the F.B.I. announced it was investigating, he tweeted again, saying, “In my opinion, these patriots did nothing wrong,” and instead “the FBI & Justice should be investigating the terrorists, anarchists, and agitators of ANTIFA.” 

In Graham, N.C., a get-out-the vote rally on Saturday ended with police using pepper spray on some participants, including young children, and making numerous arrests. Organizers of the rally called it flagrant voter suppression.

“These people are afraid,” the Rev. Gregory B. Drumwright, his eyes still burning, said as he assailed the police action in Graham. “There’s a climate of fear around this.”

And those were just the incidents that were caught on video. Kristen Clarke executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a voting rights group, said there had been many more. The group settled a lawsuit last month against officials in Graham whom they accused of violating the First Amendment rights of protesters.

“We are very concerned about groups lurking and trying to intimidate voters in particular communities,” Ms. Clarke said. Her group’s election protection hotline received calls from nearly a dozen counties in Florida just over the past week, she said, reporting individuals or groups harassing voters at the polls.

 “We want voters to know these sporadic incidents are being addressed, and we want them to be able to cast their ballot,” Ms. Clarke said.

Law enforcement authorities are increasingly worried, too — not just about what they have already seen, but also about what has been threatened, especially online. 

Most of the internet threats have not migrated to the nation’s streets, according to a senior law enforcement official who has reviewed Homeland Security Department bulletins and warnings as well as online activity from instigators on the political right and left. But law enforcement officials fear that online posts by instigators could materialize into violent acts.

Trump supporters mounted a motorcade across the New York City region on Sunday, waving flags and cheering for the president while clogging traffic on key arteries.

The supporters were spotted crossing the Mario M. Cuomo Bridge over the Hudson River in the city’s northern suburbs and bringing the busy Garden State Parkway in New Jersey at least partly to a standstill. Officials in New Jersey told a local newspaper that the motorcade stopped near the Cheesequake Service Area — about 30 miles outside New York City — and “backed traffic up for about five miles.”

Supporters waved Trump flags, leaned out of their vehicles wearing Make America Great Again hats and honked and cheered.

The Mario M. Cuomo Bridge might have been a symbolic target for Republicans — it is named for the deceased father of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who has quarreled frequently with President Trump.

A separate set of anti-Trump protesters marched in New York City to counter the pro-Trump caravans, leading to some scuffles and arrests.

Groups that monitor voting have been preparing for intimidation at the polls at least since September, when protesters disrupted voters at a polling location in Fairfax, Va. 

Of particular concern are militia groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, whose members have lurked on internet chat boards like 4Chan. “We are keeping an eye on them,” said Joanna Lydgate, national director of the Voter Protection Program which works closely with law enforcement on voting issues. 

Law enforcement officers can be a complicating factor in protecting voters. While their presence can be welcome to help calm tensions, they can also create anxieties. Ria Thompson-Washington, an executive vice president with the National Lawyers Guild, said she had been in Georgia since mid-October, when early voting began in the state, and had witnessed “a heavy police presence” at the polls. 

All of this has created extraordinary uncertainty, with fears driven not only by the potential outcome of the election but by the tensions that might erupt in the days and weeks after Election Day.

“People are upset, and scared, and frustrated,” said Caitlin Foley, a physician in Philadelphia. “I think there will be unrest, regardless of whichever candidate is in the lead.”

Turmoil has defined 2020. More than 230,000 Americans have died of Covid-19; the economy has cratered, and racial tension has sparked unrest across the country.

Gun stores have seen their stocks depleted as sales have soared. One survey of adults across the country, conducted in October by the National Police Foundation and Elucd, a data research firm, found that some three-quarters of respondents worried that the election would spur civil unrest. Across the political spectrum, there was a sense that the election carried enormous stakes in terms of determining the future of the country.

“I’m encouraged that more than 90 million Americans have already cast their ballots, which, if you do the math, is the equivalent of the entire 1996 presidential election,” Jeh C. Johnson, who served as secretary of homeland security during the Obama administration, said Sunday on the CBS program “Face the Nation.” “But we cannot discount the possibility,” he added, “of some trouble or unanticipated events, given the tension that exists out there.”

In an interview on ABC, Jason Miller, an adviser to the Trump campaign, said that Republicans were ready for a legal battle over ballots that have not been counted by Tuesday. He claimed that Democrats expect President Trump to be ahead on election night, “and then they’re going to try to steal it back after the election.” 

Even prominent Republicans pushed back on the statement, saying that the counting of ballots almost never ends on election night and that any move to end the count that quickly would be an extraordinary breach of democratic practices.

Mr. Miller deflected questions about the highway disruptions by Trump supporters, saying he was “more concerned with downtown Washington businesses having to board up their windows in anticipation of lawless, violent Biden supporters rioting and looting on Tuesday night.” There was nothing to suggest that would happen. 

Not all the political activity on Sunday was disruptive.

In Atlanta, from the virtual pulpit of Ebenezer Baptist Church, the storied congregation once led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., there was a call for calm and a plea for agitators to stay away. 

“In the wake of an election, I say to the Proud Boys and to Antifa and to other militias and armed groups, Atlanta does not want your foolishness,” the Rev. Robert M. Franklin Jr., a candidate in a runoff election to serve the final month of Representative John Lewis’s term in Congress, said in a sermon. 

In Harrisburg, Pa., Annie Bravacos, 17, said she had felt a creeping dread about the election, and since she and her friends were too young to vote, they decided to canvass on a rainy Sunday afternoon. 

“It’s easy to just get terrified about that, so just doing this, I guess, is what makes us feel better,” she said. “It’s, you know, we’re actually doing something, even if it’s small.”

In Ashland, Ky., Mark Carlisle, whose blue pickup flies two American flags and booms out patriotic songs from a speaker, said he was more concerned about ballot tampering than anything happening at his local polling station in a school.

“My ballot getting messed with? Yes. Me afraid to go somewhere? No,” said Mr. Carlisle, a 58-year-old building contractor, explaining why he refused to vote by mail or vote early.

In Durham, N.C., Garrett Langley Henson was updating his website last week when an unknown number popped up on his phone. When Mr. Langley Henson answered, a prerecorded voice told him to “stand back, stay home, stay safe,” and then hung up. He received the same call, but from a different number, the next day. 

“The undertone was very menacing,” Mr. Langley Henson said.

In Graham, N.C., a city of roughly 15,000 people between Greensboro and Durham, the police said protest organizers had failed to coordinate with city officials in planning their rally, and that it became “unsafe and unlawful.” Officials disputed any accusations of trying to thwart voters from getting to the polls. 

The police said that eight people were arrested on suspicion of resisting the officers and failing to disperse. One was charged with assaulting a law enforcement officer. The department also said officers fired a “mild irritant” on the ground and not directly at protesters.

Pastor Drumwright tried to preach a message of resilience on Sunday. For generations, obstacles had stood in the way of voting for African Americans. And this, in his view, was the latest iteration.

“We’re still having to march, to protest, to petition, to speak out, to demonstrate, to activate,” Pastor Drumwright said. “We are shaken,” he added. “But we are not broken.”

"In Dash to Finish, Biden and Trump Set Up Showdown in Pennsylvania","[Joe Biden has won the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Read our story]

PHILADELPHIA — As the national early vote climbs past a staggering 93 million and challenges to the electoral process intensify across states, President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. are barreling into Pennsylvania and turning it into the top battleground in Tuesday’s election, with Democrats flooding in with door-knockers and Republicans trying to parlay Mr. Trump’s rallies into big turnout once again.

​Both campaigns see Pennsylvania as increasingly crucial to victory: Mr. Trump now appears more competitive here than in Michigan and Wisconsin, two other key northern states he hopes to win, and Mr. Biden’s clearest electoral path to the White House runs through the state. Pennsylvania has more Electoral College votes, 20, than any other traditional battleground except Florida, and Mr. Trump won the state by less than one percentage point in 2016.

Mr. Trump devoted Saturday to four rallies across the state, and he and Mr. Biden planned campaign events for the final 48 hours of the race as well, with a wave of prominent Democrats and celebrities slated to arrive. On Monday the president was set to make an appeal to white, working-class voters in Scranton, where Mr. Biden was born, while the Democratic nominee was aiming to solidify a broad coalition of white suburbanites and voters of color on a two-day swing through Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and elsewhere in western Pennsylvania.

Mr. Biden is ahead with a modest margin in recent polls, and is trying to cut into the president’s turnout in rural counties. But Mr. Trump’s rallies have energized many Republican voters, and his team is already preparing legal challenges over the vote if it ends up being close. On Sunday, the president told reporters, “as soon as that election’s over, we’re going in with our lawyers.” 

In Pennsylvania in particular, the possibility of extended court battles and confusion hangs over the race, with the state Republican Party hoping the Supreme Court will reconsider its decision last week to allow the state to continue receiving absentee ballots for three days after Election Day. 

“Every day is a new reminder of how high the stakes are, how far the other side will go to try to suppress the turnout,” Mr. Biden said as he campaigned here Sunday. “Especially here in Philadelphia. President Trump is terrified of what will happen in Pennsylvania.”

Court battles have already rearranged the voting process across an array of states and continued to do so on Sunday. The Texas Supreme Court denied an effort by Republicans to throw out more than 120,000 votes that had been cast at drive-through locations in Harris County, an increasingly Democratic area anchored in Houston. Republicans are now hoping for a favorable ruling at the federal level, where a judge has called an election-eve hearing for Monday.

Some Trump supporters also turned disruptive on Sunday: Vehicles bearing Trump flags halted traffic on the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey; local officials said the motorcade backed up traffic for several miles. In Georgia, a rally for Democrats that had been scheduled was canceled, with organizers citing worries over what they feared was a “large militia presence” drawn by Mr. Trump’s own event nearby.

Throughout his final sprint of rallies, Mr. Trump has moved to baselessly sow doubt about the integrity of the electoral process. At an appearance in Dubuque, Iowa, on Sunday, Mr. Trump claimed, inaccurately, that the result of the election was always determined on Election Day. “We should know the result of the election on Nov. 3,” he said. “The evening of Nov. 3. That’s the way it’s been and that’s the way it should be. What’s going on in this country?”

Mr. Biden countered with his own warning later Sunday, saying, “The president is not going to steal this election.”

Mr. Trump’s lagging position in the race was evident in his grueling travel schedule that had him shoring up votes in five states he won four years ago — Michigan, Iowa, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida.

His final rally of the day was scheduled for 11 p.m., and risked violating a midnight curfew in Miami-Dade County.

Mr. Biden, by contrast, set his sights squarely on Pennsylvania on Sunday, an approach he will repeat again Monday, along with a foray into Ohio, a state Mr. Trump won handily in 2016 but that polls show could be more competitive now.

The Biden campaign was intensifying its push in Pennsylvania, encouraging supporters from out of state to join canvassing efforts that for months it had sworn off because of the health risks. The campaign said that volunteers had knocked on more than 350,000 doors on Saturday, and made 2 million calls and sent 1.5 million text messages to voters in the state.

Compared with other swing states, such as Florida, far fewer early ballots have already been cast in Pennsylvania and, according to the U.S. Elections Project, as of Sunday there were more than 350,000 absentee ballots that had been requested by Democratic voters that had yet to be returned. The Biden campaign is focused on the fact that a large share of the electorate here is still expected to vote on Election Day, an adviser said.

The final sprint of the race came against a different backdrop than in previous elections, with fewer voters left to motivate. The record number of early votes underscored the intense interest in one of the most consequential elections in modern history, despite the logistical challenges of voting amid a pandemic.

Mr. Biden spent Sunday afternoon with Black voters at a drive-in “Souls to the Polls” event at a Philadelphia church. His outreach came as Democrats have worried about his ability to sufficiently energize and turn out Black and Latino Democratic voters in some states. He addressed another drive-in rally in the city Sunday evening, reminding voters of their influence over the outcome.

Mr. Trump, for his part, made his own pitch to Black voters while campaigning in Hickory, N.C. “To every Black American, I am asking you to vote on Tuesday,” he said, projecting confidence about his own standing with Black voters.

Mr. Biden’s Philadelphia events kicked off a last push through the state over the final two days. On Monday, Mr. Biden, Senator Kamala Harris and their spouses are expected to campaign in five media markets, hoping to cement support across a sprawling coalition and to keep Mr. Trump’s margins down in parts of western Pennsylvania that propelled him to victory in 2016.

“My message is simple,” Mr. Biden said Sunday. “Pennsylvania is critical in this election.”

Democrats are well aware of how devoted Mr. Trump’s core base remains. In Macomb County in Michigan, where the president held his first rally Sunday, Irwin Patterson was selling Trump merchandise at a makeshift roadside store.

“In Michigan here, just our little part of Michigan, the support that we see here is just insane,” he said, as windblown snow pelted his customers. “I mean, for the last month and a half, it’s just been off the hook.”

Still, Mr. Trump had work to do all over the country shoring up his support in states he won four years ago. In Michigan, Mr. Trump complained repeatedly about the freezing temperature and biting wind he said was pointed “directly” at his face while making false claims about resuscitating the auto industry there. He also embraced the actions of some of his supporters in Texas who had surrounded a Biden campaign bus with their vehicles on Saturday, in an apparent attempt to slow it down and run it off the road. Mr. Trump claimed the vehicles were “protecting his bus, yesterday, because they are nice.” 

Later, he tweeted in response to the news that the F.B.I. was investigating the incident that “in my opinion, these patriots did nothing wrong,” adding that federal authorities should be scrutinizing antifa instead. 

Of the three big Northern swing states Mr. Trump won by a hair four years ago, the once reliably blue state of Pennsylvania is the one his advisers believe is most likely within his reach. That’s in large part because of the support of rural voters and Mr. Biden’s call for eventually phasing out fossil fuels, an unpopular stance for many voters in a state with a large natural gas industry.

Mr. Trump entered the final hours of the race in a worse position here than he was four years ago, when Pennsylvania was seen as Hillary Clinton’s firewall. This time, Mr. Biden has a lead of six points, according to a new New York Times/Siena College poll released Sunday, and is working to create multiple pathways to 270 electoral votes.

That lead, however, isn’t enough to make Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans feel fully confident about the state of the race in Pennsylvania. Some of the president’s opponents in recent days have been worried about turnout in the state's rural counties, as well as calls about requested ballots that never arrived.

The Trump campaign ads running in Pennsylvania have been overwhelmingly centered on economic messages, mainly jobs and taxes. The campaign’s most aired ad in Pennsylvania over the past week has been a negative ad claiming Mr. Biden will raise taxes (he has said he will raise taxes for those making over $400,000).

But the Biden campaign has not ceded the subject to the president, with 14 different ads on air that touch on jobs and the economy. Its most aired ad in Pennsylvania over the past week featured a Biden speech outlining his plans for pandemic recovery, including jobs. Another ad directly rebuts the Trump campaign’s attacks on his tax plan.

Pennsylvania’s economy is emerging from the pandemic recession but still has a long road ahead to its pre-crisis state. Like the nation, it has seen a two-track recovery that has left small businesses and low-earning workers behind.

Pennsylvania saw its unemployment rate fall to 8.1 percent in September, according to the Labor Department, nearly identical to the national rate of 7.9 percent. That is a significant improvement from the 16.1 percent unemployment it posted in April. But the state still had 380,000 fewer jobs in September than it did in September of 2019, and there are 18 percent fewer small businesses open here compared to a year ago, according to data compiled by the economists at Opportunity Insights.

Pennsylvania has long loomed large in the psyche of the Biden campaign. Mr. Biden, a Scranton native, gave his first speech of his presidential campaign in Pittsburgh, and he chose Philadelphia for his campaign headquarters, before the pandemic hit.

“That blue wall has to be re-established,” Mr. Biden said in another recent Pennsylvania campaign appearance. He said that winning the state meant a “great deal to me, personally as well as politically.”

Caregivers Have Witnessed the Coronavirus’s Pain. How Will They Vote?,"At the Pennsylvania long-term care facility where Tisheia Frazier works, the coronavirus was a terror. During the most harrowing weeks of the pandemic in April and May, she said, four residents died in a matter of hours, and 70 people in an 180-bed unit died in less than a month.

Another caregiver, Ellen Glunt, recalled watching an older couple celebrate their 80th wedding anniversary. The wife held a wedding photo up to the glass window, as her ailing husband remained on the other side.

And then there is Bob Lohoefer, a nursing director in Philadelphia with almost 40 years of experience who has had flashbacks to the trauma rooms he worked in decades ago. At the height of the pandemic, he sat at his desk, a shield over his face, so frustrated by the government’s handling of the virus and his own organization's bureaucracy that he thought to himself: “I don’t want to do this.”

Few groups have witnessed more of the virus’s horrors than caregivers — frontline workers who have grappled with the public health crisis while trying to help older people at risk of isolation, distress and, in some cases, death. The deaths of almost 40 percent of all Americans killed by the coronavirus have been linked to nursing homes and similar facilities — indoor spaces crowded with vulnerable adults. The share is even higher in Pennsylvania, where deaths in nursing and personal-care facilities account for close to two-thirds of coronavirus deaths statewide.

In interviews ahead of the election with more than a dozen caregivers in Pennsylvania, one of the country’s most important battleground states, they described how their experiences are shaping their political outlooks. It has hardened some convictions and transformed some caretakers, otherwise apolitical, into activists. It has forced others to reassess their beliefs about American exceptionalism, the role of government in their lives and their industry, and their decision about whom to vote for in November.

“Nine months ago, I would have told you that I was 100 percent behind Trump,” Mr. Lohoefer, a lifelong Republican, said of the president. “But as a result of Covid, I’m not 100 percent sure where I stand now.”

The problems Pennsylvania has encountered are emblematic of the nation as a whole: There were struggles to procure personal protective equipment, difficulties with rapid testing, staffing shortages, disagreements between local, state and federal government agencies and new rules piled onto an already heavily regulated industry.

And although several health care executives maintained that most of Pennsylvania’s senior care communities have relatively few confirmed Covid-19 cases, and that their staff members have performed heroically, stakeholders in every corner of caregiving agree that the pandemic exposed the country’s overburdened health care system, testing the mental, emotional and physical limits of all of the people who work in it.

“If you don’t see it, you really don’t understand how difficult it is,” said Louise Santee, a longtime caregiver who brought a curling iron to work to calm a resident who could not understand why she could no longer go to the hairdresser. “It is truly heart-wrenching when you see what this has done to our people.”

In interviews, caregivers as well as patient advocates, medical professionals, facility managers and residents themselves said they had never experienced anything like the first six months of the pandemic.

Maintenance workers were sent to hardware stores to buy disposable paint tarps that could be fashioned into gowns. Nurses pleaded with their bosses to let them lower their masks just so residents could recognize them; some forced their family members to go stay with relatives, terrified that they would bring the virus into their home. And some residents could not understand why they were suddenly cut off from their families and the world.

The chaos was so pervasive that it was nearly impossible, everyone said, to separate what was happening from the politics at play. As caretakers endured day after exhausting day, state officials set forth new regulations to govern how nursing homes should work. And President Trump delivered a drumbeat of dangerous claims — mocking masks, praising unproven treatments, speculating about bleach and about the virus disappearing.

Some residents became so dismayed by Mr. Trump’s conduct that they set up voter registration drives on their campuses; others held mini protests near major roads, holding signs and soliciting honks from passing vehicles. A few frontline workers began phone banking at home and writing to their state legislators.

And top officials at care facilities voiced deep frustration about how the virus response rapidly devolved from a public health issue to a partisan fight. They insisted that faster, clearer and better-coordinated government intervention could have saved lives.

“When you work in our business, you become accustomed to a certain level of bumbling,” said Jim Bernardo, the president of Presbyterian Senior Living, which cares for thousands of older people in Pennsylvania and beyond. “This rose to an entirely different level.”

Surveys of Pennsylvania voters show that Mr. Trump’s standing has been damaged in recent months by his administration’s handling of the coronavirus. At the end of February, around the time one of the first known virus deaths in the United States was reported, polling averages had Mr. Trump and his opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., separated by roughly three percentage points in Pennsylvania. Those polling averages now show Mr. Biden ahead of Mr. Trump by a wider margin. A New York Times/Siena College survey released Sunday showed Mr. Biden up by six points in the state, which Mr. Trump won narrowly in 2016.

Four years later, with its 20 electoral votes, Pennsylvania looms as one of the most important swing states in the election. Many of Mr. Trump’s remaining paths to victory require him to win the Keystone State, and to do that, he needs voters like Mr. Lohoefer, the nursing director, in his camp.

Mr. Lohoefer voted for Mr. Trump in 2016. But he has been pushed to his limits. He recalled with derision how the government and his corporate office would send sudden, often conflicting mandates during the early days of the pandemic.

It was eyewear that sent Mr. Lohoefer over the edge. At one point, he said, he was told every worker needed goggles, so he ordered $1,100 worth of fitted goggles only to be told four days later that goggles should be replaced with face shields.

“We even went to the point where we bought colorful ones so people choose their color,” he vented six months after the episode.

Mr. Lohoefer’s views are complicated. He is a Republican who believes all Americans should be guaranteed good health care. He is a medical worker of a mixed mind on masks. He is deeply skeptical about the effectiveness of plexiglass barriers — and even more suspicious of the policymaking logic that made them so pervasive.

Over all, he thinks the reaction to the virus was “overkill,” but he also thinks Mr. Trump was wrong to suggest it was “nothing to worry about.”

”He did a terrible job,” Mr. Lohoefer said of Mr. Trump’s handling of the pandemic. “But everybody did a terrible job.”

As the virus spread across her facility, Ms. Frazier, the caretaker who witnessed dozens of deaths, said she would see Mr. Trump on television without a mask and grow frustrated. And although she has voted for Republicans and had been a fan of Mr. Trump’s when he was on reality television, she began to blame his cavalier response for her worsening situation at work.

Americans, she came to believe, would not act until the virus affected them personally.

“If we want to make America great again, then we need to change the political face of our country,” she said, noting that she has made a point of discussing her view of Mr. Trump with Republican friends. Ms. Frazier said she would vote for Mr. Biden somewhat begrudgingly, mostly as a vote against Mr. Trump.

“I can’t even tell this story without having a tear coming down my face,” she added. “How can you, as the leader of our country, stand in front of our thousands and not show emotion?”

Ms. Frazier began to cry as she recalled her final moments in April with a resident with whom she had built a rapport over several years.

During better times, the woman assumed the role of floor matriarch. She was “sassy,” and would tell you “exactly what she felt,” Ms. Frazier said. Sometimes, when she had a spare moment during her shift, Ms. Frazier would pop by and say “Hey, beautiful!” — and the woman would beam.

But as Ms. Frazier put it, the virus “took her smile away.” Restrictions kept the woman’s family away. She lost weight — almost “half her body size,” Ms. Frazier said. A grim thought crossed her mind: She might be one of the last people the woman would see before she died.

Eventually, hearing her friend’s cries for care became too much. Ms. Frazier couldn’t help herself. She broke the rules.

“I took my gloves off and held her hand without the gloves,” Ms. Frazier said. “I knew she would pass then, and I did not want her to pass without having human touch.”"
Inspiring Black Voters Is Key to Biden’s Prospects in Florida,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — One Saturday last month, after Democrats held a news conference in this city’s predominantly Black east side to promote the start of early voting, State Senator Audrey Gibson offered her view about why turnout among Florida’s African-Americans dropped so strikingly in 2016.

“Some people were in mourning because President Obama could not run again,” Ms. Gibson said.

Around the corner, Joanne Townsend was blunter as she prepared fried fish and steamed crabs at a charity event. “We didn’t really think he was going to get in there last time,” Ms. Townsend, a retiree, said while reflecting the pervasive skepticism that Donald Trump could win in 2016. “I kept saying, ‘They’re not going to put that fool in there,’ and he got in there.”

Four years after President Trump carried Florida by just over one point, no other single battleground poses quite the impediment to his re-election as America’s largest traditional swing state. A loss in Florida, where several late polls show Joseph R. Biden Jr. with a modest lead, would be the most ominous sign for the president’s re-election chances on Tuesday night, given that the state was expected to report results faster than most key battlegrounds.

And no group of voters may be as vital to Mr. Biden’s success as African-Americans in Florida, a complicated political patchwork that is difficult for Democrats to capture under favorable circumstances and all but impossible for them to win if there is any ebb in enthusiasm among Black voters.

That’s what happened four years ago when only 65 percent of the state’s Black voters cast ballots, compared with 73 percent in 2012. In county after county where Black voters represent at least a quarter of the population — from the lightly-populated farmland in the Florida Panhandle to the state’s pulsating cities — Hillary Clinton’s share of the vote declined from what former President Barack Obama had garnered four years earlier.

Mr. Biden’s fate in Florida may hinge in part on whether he can reverse that slide.

“There was a lack of excitement four years ago,” said Ramon Alexander, a state representative from the Tallahassee area, who recalled the lack of energy in the city’s two large universities: Florida State and the historically Black Florida A&M. “I remember talking to young folks in the dorms at FAMU and F.S.U.; they were not going to vote or some were voting for Jill Stein. I haven’t heard any of that this time.”

The initial indicators for Mr. Biden have been mixed and Democratic groups, including those funded by Michael R. Bloomberg, have raced to pour more money into get-out-the-vote efforts in Florida’s Black precincts, according to party strategists familiar with the spending.

Democrats also raced over the weekend to organize a second event for Mr. Obama in South Florida in as many weeks for an election eve rally.

Despite the challenges, many African-American leaders here say they are reassured by the boiling anger among their constituents toward the president.

In dozens of interviews conducted over the past month across a range of Black communities in Florida, many voters expressed a deep contempt for Mr. Trump, a more modest affection for Mr. Biden, and an overriding conviction that the coronavirus pandemic and episodes of racial injustice this year made 2020 an election they cannot sit out.

If Mr. Trump wins again, said Deon Lee, a volunteer at a get-out-the-vote event in Gadsden County, near Tallahassee, “it means that we didn’t come out in enough numbers, and we did not take seriously the impact of our vote.”

. Before the final day of early voting in the state, when many organizers were holding “souls to the polls” get-out-the-vote efforts aimed at African-Americans, Black Floridians who had already cast ballots were only slightly underperforming. They make up about 13 percent of the electorate and were close to turning out at that rate, according to Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist and executive director of a pro-Biden super PAC.

The number of Black voters is likely to grow because parts of the Black community traditionally prefer to wait until Election Day to vote: in a new New York Times/Siena College poll of Florida voters, 43 percent of African-Americans here said they would cast their ballot at the polls on Tuesday.

What’s perhaps most significant about the early vote, though, is that a group of new African-American voters have been energized: of the Black voters in Florida who’ve already voted, about 15 percent of them did not cast ballots in 2016 or 2018.

There are warning signs for Mr. Biden: Black voter turnout in Miami-Dade, the state’s largest county, is lagging. Cuban-American voters there appear energized and surveys indicate they are more supportive of Mr. Trump this year than they were four years ago.

“We didn’t have lines and they had lines,” said State Senator Oscar Braynon II, referring to voting sites with heavy Republican turnout in the first days of early voting.

Since then, turnout at Democratic-leaning sites has improved, he said on Friday, as he took a break for lunch in between shifts working outside the polls. A number of campaign events took place this past weekend, including Souls to the Polls gatherings in Black neighborhoods.

Given Mr. Biden’s greatly improved standing over Mrs. Clinton among older voters and college-educated whites, he may be able to overcome a drop-off with Florida’s Hispanic electorate — if he can drive strong Black turnout.

Florida is not only the largest but also the most complex of the traditional presidential battlegrounds, as much a collection of distinct city-states as a single cohesive place. Much like the state’s Hispanics, a diverse group of people with roots from the Caribbean and throughout the Americas, Black voters in Florida also reflect a range of identities.

There are African-Americans in agrarian-based communities across central and north Florida anchored in the church like their rural counterparts across the Deep South; Black voters across all income levels in large cities like Orlando, Tampa and Jacksonville; and a growing number of Caribbean-American migrants in South Florida who chiefly identify with their country of origin.

No matter their ancestry, however, many Black Floridians across the state expressed a common loathing of Mr. Trump, an animus borne of the conviction that he’s a bigot and because of his cavalier handling of the coronavirus crisis, which has disproportionately impacted African-Americans.

“Same energy, different motivation,” said Nwabufo Umunna, a Jacksonville lawyer, comparing this year to Mr. Obama’s elections. “This is more saving ourselves. Two things motivate people — fear and hope. This year, it’s fear.”

That was the case for Alicia Maxwell, a nurse who voted early last month at the Miramar branch library in Broward County.

As she cast her ballot, Ms. Maxwell, who is Jamaican-American and has tended to patients with the coronavirus, wore goggles, two masks and a shirt that read, “We choose science over fiction.”

“More lives would have been saved if the president, who gets firsthand information, had listened to the experts,” she said, adding that she would have cast a ballot for Mr. Trump’s opponent even if his rival “had been a ham sandwich.”

Democrats have lavished attention on South Florida, with Mr. Biden, Mr. Obama and Senator Kamala Harris of California repeatedly visiting in the final weeks. Mr. Bloomberg’s political arm has started airing footage from Mr. Obama’s rally in a new television ad aimed at the region’s voters. “Miami, I’m asking you to remember what this country can be,” Mr. Obama says in the footage.

Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris have both targeted communities with Black voters of Caribbean descent; South Florida is home to the largest number of Haitians in the United States, and no county in the nation has more Jamaicans than Broward. Jamaican-Americans make up the entire Miramar City Commission.

“In some ways, it has been easier than four years ago,” said Francesca Menes, a Haitian-Dominican American and the chairwoman of the Black Collective, a nonprofit organization aimed at uniting the Black diaspora. “At least the campaign has shown the commitment to our communities. In 2016, there were a lot of personal feelings and frustrations that people held about the Clinton family.”

Back then, some Haitian-Americans blamed Mrs. Clinton, former President Bill Clinton and the Clinton Foundation for some of the woes in Haiti, where the couple and the foundation did extensive work. But the Trump administration has since tried to end temporary protected status for Haitian immigrants and Mr. Trump has referred to Haiti with a disparaging expletive. 

Mr. Biden appeared to refer to those instances at the Little Haiti Cultural Center in Miami this month. “Wouldn’t it be an irony — an irony of all ironies — if on election eve, it turned out Haitians literally delivered a coup de grâce in this election?” he said.Picking Ms. Harris, the daughter of a Jamaican father and Indian mother, energized Black voters of West Indian descent, said Marlon A. Hill, a Jamaican-American lawyer in Miami who interviewed Ms. Harris on his weekly Caribbean radio show in September.

“The Caribbean vote always gets overlooked,” Mr. Hill said, noting that it could help offset the Republicans’ “firewall” of conservative-leaning Cuban voters.

This year, Mr. Hill said, “there’s some recognition that there needs to be greater investment in the layers of the community.” The Biden campaign has produced ads for Haitian Creole television, English-language Caribbean radio stations and Caribbean publications.In Gadsden County, about 500 miles to the northwest, a group of local African Methodist Episcopal churches have been organizing get-out-the-vote drives in a region that was once filled with tobacco farms.

Voters there said their status as the only majority-Black county in Florida gave them a unique sense of purpose: If anyone should lead the political rebellion against Mr. Trump, they said, it should be them.

“The divisiveness — the racial divide — it has motivated people of color, I think,” Belinda George, a local resident, said. “People have seen the consequences of sitting out. They’ve seen what’s going on.”

The region, which includes a number of the state’s mostly heavily Black counties, can sometimes be overlooked because of the better-known and more populous Black communities to the east and the south.

“Sometimes, for presidential candidates and small rural counties that look like us, the engagement piece is not always a priority,” Nick Fryson, a young organizer, said.In Gadsden, as is true in many Black communities across the country, there are two driving forces behind political mobilization; older Black voters are often reached through their churches, while the younger and more nonreligious population is targeted by a loose network of community groups and progressive organizations.

It’s the second of these that has been an explicit mission for the older volunteers. Powering through a trademark Florida rainstorm recently, many said they were encouraging residents to vote early and pushing an urgent message: Defeating Mr. Trump was personal, so ensure your vote will count.

At one point, a volunteer named Clydie Young posed the question of the moment to her 36-year-old daughter: “What do you think about Trump?”

“Am I allowed to curse?” Kahwani Young shot back. When her mother disapproved, she decided it wasn’t worth answering. “Then I’ve got nothing to say.”

Jonathan Martin reported from Jacksonville, Fla.; Patricia Mazzei from Miramar, Fla., and Astead W. Herndon from Quincy, Fla."
"Trump, Biden and the Tough Guy, Nice Guy Politics of 2020","Kindness. Humility. Responsibility. These traits were once “the definition of manliness,” Barack Obama told a crowd on Saturday, campaigning in Flint, Mich., for his former running mate, Joseph R. Biden Jr.

Though he did not name him, it was clear whom the former president was talking about.

“It used to be being a man meant taking care of other people, not going around bragging,” Mr. Obama said.

The words were evocative, and not simply because Mr. Obama followed them by knocking down a slick three-point basketball shot at the gymnasium of the high school where the drive-in rally was held — a kind of viral punctuation mark to his thoughts on manliness.

In two days, Americans will take their shot, making a choice between two presidential candidates who resemble vastly different case studies in what a man, even in 2020, should do or be.

On the one extreme is President Trump, who leaves little subtlety in his approach: bragging about his sexual prowess, along with the size of his nuclear button, proclaiming “domination” over coronavirus and mocking his opponent for the size of his mask (“the biggest mask I’ve ever seen”), as if mask-wearing is somehow weak. (The two dozen sexual assault allegations against him have not hampered the bragging.)

He has said he believes men who change diapers are “acting like the wife.” “Macho Man” is the song that plays at his rallies, even after the Village People objected. “He seeks to distinguish himself as the manliest — and thus, in his mind, the most-qualified — person to be president,” said Kelly Dittmar, a scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.

On the other end of the spectrum, or perhaps somewhere in the middle, is Mr. Biden, a “Dad-like” figure, as the philosopher Kate Manne put it, who has vowed to be America’s protector through a dark period, with some combination of strength, empathy and compassion. 

He chose Kamala Harris, a barrier-breaking woman, as his running mate. He has surrounded himself with strong women. “He’s offering a more paternalistic type of masculinity, in that you can be a strong leader but still be compassionate and empathetic,” said Marianne Cooper, a sociologist at Stanford University who studies gender and work.

Mr. Obama, the man with whom Mr. Biden served, had to navigate the more complex demands of Black masculinity in the public eye. He did it with a “cool-dad” approach — self-confident but without crowding out the love.

Mr. Biden is perhaps a more sensitive new-age grandfather, who speaks tenderly of his family — he’s made a point to take phone calls from his grandchildren at any time, especially in front of cameras — and isn’t afraid to express emotion. But he will also drive a Corvette in a campaign ad or challenge a voter (and his opponent) to a push-up contest. (Yes, he will call Mr. Trump a “clown” during a debate but he will later say he regretted the language.)

“He reads as a man who won’t start a fight, but would punch back if provoked,” said Robb Willer, a sociologist, also at Stanford, who has studied the way threats to masculinity influence men’s behavior.

Remember four years ago, when Democrats planned to celebrate the election of the first woman as president by dropping 200 pounds of confetti shaped like glass shards to signify the crumbling of that “highest, hardest” glass ceiling? Or how, just last year, the Democratic field was still the most diverse, and female, in history?

It seems hard to parse how, in 2020, against a backdrop of a global pandemic that has left a disproportionate number of women out of work — and with polls predicting what may be the biggest gender gap in electoral history — the presidential election has become, among other things, a referendum on masculinity.

And yet here we are.

“Ultimately, masculinity still matters, we’ve learned. It’s how candidates still try to prove they are the best candidate,” said Ms. Cooper. “And so, even in 2020, Democrats decided the safest bet to beat a white man in his 70s is another white man in his 70s.”

White American masculinity has been a factor in nearly every presidential election since the nation’s founding. “Trump is an exaggeration of an existing phenomenon, but he didn’t create it,” said Jackson Katz, the author of “Man Enough? Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, and the Politics of Presidential Masculinity.”

From Richard Nixon to Ronald Reagan and right on through Mr. Trump, largely white, Christian, heterosexual presidential candidates have “performed” manhood in all sorts of ways: Donning hard hats and posing inside military tanks; battling over who would be the better guy to have a beer with; and implying their opponents were soft, weak or “sleepy.”

Reagan, a former Hollywood actor, began dressing the part (cowboy hats, bluejeans) while George W. Bush — a graduate of Yale and Harvard — bought a ranch in Texas (along with a series of very big belt buckles) shortly before announcing his candidacy. 

Sometimes these men were Democrats, but often they were Republicans — a party that has long recognized the power of “strong man identities” to appeal to working-class white voters, said David Collinson, a professor of leadership and organization at Lancaster University who, with colleague Jeff Hearn, professor of gender studies at Örebro University in Sweden, has written on the contrasting masculinities of Biden and Trump.

In 1987, when George H.W. Bush, who had once described his quest for a “kinder, gentler nation,” appeared on the cover of Newsweek with the phrase, “The ‘Wimp Factor,’” his advisers, which included Lee Atwater and Roger Ailes, quickly shifted into gear.

“Michael Dukakis had a 17-point lead over Bush in the summer of 1988,” said Mr. Katz, whose book on presidential masculinity has been adapted into a documentary called “The Man Card.” “So what did they do? They relentlessly attacked his manhood. They suggested he was a failed protector, that he was ‘soft,’ that he wasn’t a ‘real man.’”

A decade later, when the younger Bush ran against John Kerry, he took a similar tack: He taunted his opponent for speaking French and painted him as an out-of-touch aristocrat even as he tried to present himself as a “war president.”

“This happens all the time,” said Tristan Bridges, an associate professor of sociology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the co-editor of the journal, Men and Masculinities. “One guy presents himself as a kind of salt of the earth, a person you could hang out with, and then effectively emasculates the other by presenting them as the opposite.”

“I think the performance of masculinity means a lot,” he noted, “because it has the potential to eclipse all else.”

One notable performance, Mr. Bridges said, was in 1840, when William Henry Harrison, a presidential newcomer, relentlessly pilloried the incumbent, Martin Van Buren (“Marty,” as he called him) as “effeminate and obsequious.” 

Harrison won by a landslide, but there was a twist. He delivered the longest inauguration speech on record, on a cold day in Washington in the middle of winter, and refused to wear a coat. Three weeks later, Harrison fell ill with pneumonia. He was dead a month into his term.

Not wearing a coat — or, say, a candidate rolling up his sleeves when talking with voters — are small contests with dignity, said Mr. Bridges. But they can have big consequences.

Ms. Dittmar, the author of a book on stereotypes in political strategy, explained it this way: Political strategy 101 involves paying attention to what voters want in a candidate. They look at polling data, and inevitably hear words like “tough” and “strong,” or issues like “national security.” The words in and of themselves are not gendered, and yet, have historically been associated with men — and often, certain types of men.

Which leaves not only men, but also women to display masculinity traits, though it tends to be more complicated for them. When women exhibit traits that tend to be associated with male leadership — like toughness — they are often viewed as too aggressive, but they must also not seem too “soft” to lead. It leads to a complicated dance.

Ms. Dittmar noted that Hillary Clinton’s one-time adviser, Mark Penn, wrote in a 2006 memo to Mrs. Clinton that while voters may not be ready for “the first mama” president, they could be open to “the first father being a woman,” whatever that was supposed to mean.

(When she ran again eight years later, of course, the guidance was different.)

Part of what makes the role of gender in politics so complicated, said Ms. Cooper, is that while women are still contorting into a masculine framework, men are continually having to prove themselves as man “enough.”

Social scientists call this “precarious masculinity,” the idea that manhood is something that must be proven over a lifetime while womanhood is perceived to be fixed. Girls receive a message that they “become” women — typically through a biological event like menstruation — while men are told throughout their lives to “be” men or to “man up,” as if masculinity is something that can be easily lost.

“You don’t really say ‘be a woman’ the way you say ‘be a man’ or ‘man up,’” she said.

It’s that enduring need to prove, she said, that can have far-reaching implications.

Research by Robb Willer, of Stanford, found that when masculinity is challenged, men tend to overcompensate by increasing their support for more stereotypically masculine things, like war or wanting to purchase an SUV.

Daniel Cassino, a political scientist at Fairleigh Dickinson University, found in 2016 that just the mention of women as breadwinners led some men to abandon their support for Hillary Clinton and express support for President Trump. (The same was not true for those who supported Bernie Sanders, indicating that people were responding to a woman as a potential leader, not a Democrat.)

And 2018 research by Ms. Cooper and four colleagues, published in the Journal of Social Issues, found that the need to prove one’s masculinity can be particularly damaging in a workplace context — leading to unreasonable or unnecessary risk-taking, bragging, cutting corners, bullying, even sexual harassment.

Such behavior was most likely to be found in male-dominated environments characterized by a “winner-takes-all approach” — and where winners tended to exhibit traits like toughness or ruthlessness, the study found.

In Ms. Cooper’s view, those traits are central to presidential politics today.

“Trump is the personification of this masculinity contest culture,” Ms. Cooper said. “It’s bad for organizations, it’s terrible for a country.”

If the return to masculinity, exaggerated or calibrated, is dispiriting to some, there is perhaps a silver lining: Americans — or at least, American women — may finally be more cleareyed about its limits.

Since the 1980s, women have turned out to vote in higher numbers than men — and the latest polls predict a potentially historic gender gap between the candidates.

Maybe women were always the intended audience for the contests. Whether that’s true, they seem to be ready to render a clear judgment. Mr. Biden is leading among women by as much as 20 points."
"To Trump, ‘the Polls That Matter’ Point to Victory. The Rest Are ‘Fake.’","When President Trump talks about polling, his focus is very much on survey-takers that he thinks are good for him. Polls that show him trailing Joseph R. Biden Jr. — virtually all national polls — are simply “fake news.”

The president’s blinkered view has created something of an alternate universe, one not governed by polling averages or independent analysis but by declarative statements that, at times, feel as if they are coming out of nowhere.

This month, Mr. Trump proclaimed on Twitter that he was “winning BIG in all of the polls that matter.”

Such polls seem to boil down to Rasmussen Reports, which consistently — and in isolation — has a rosier picture for the president nationally than other surveys do, and the Trafalgar Group, which has had better numbers for Mr. Trump in Midwestern states.

His choose-your-own-adventure approach to polling that has shown little understanding of data science, and his pronouncements have come as his advisers are trying to take in serious polling and data analysis to make sense of what the electorate voting in 2020 will look like.

It has been a hallmark of Mr. Trump’s public commentary since the first time he ran for president that he treats polling as rigged against him if it isn’t favorable for him. Despite his campaign spending $10 million over the past two years on some of the most sophisticated data available, the president prefers to use what he sees on the news. And he treats voter support as a mystical, rather than a mathematical, proposition.

Some of Mr. Trump’s advisers believe there is a wellspring of “shy” or “hidden” Trump voters — predominantly whites without college educations in rural areas — who are either not candid with pollsters about their choice for president, or aren’t responsive to pollsters at all.

This week, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, gave his own view of how polling works to Fox News, trumpeting “big data modeling” over old-fashioned phone calling.

“I speak to all my state directors,” said Mr. Kushner, who has positioned himself as the leader of the Trump campaign, though he is not in fact the campaign manager, adding, “I do believe that polling with phones to people is an obsolete method, especially in the era of cancel culture. You’ve got a lot of snake oil salesmen who have kind of been in the business for a long time and they do this.”

He concluded, “They were all completely wrong last time, and they didn’t make any modifications going forward.”

That is not quite true: Though many state polls proved very wrong in 2016, the national polls that projected Hillary Clinton narrowly winning the most votes were close to the mark, and many polling outfits did make modifications, weighting, for instance, for educational backgrounds.

Complaining that polls are “skewed” against Republicans has been a vocal pastime of Republican candidates for several election cycles, reaching a high pitch in 2012, when Mitt Romney was the party’s presidential nominee.

Officials continue to claim in 2020 that the public polling is wrong because they’re “skewed” against Mr. Trump, overweighting Democrats in the samples.

Robert Blizzard, a Republican pollster with Public Opinion Strategies, said that incumbents usually ended up “on Election Day with a ballot share that is within a point or two of their October job approval score.” In Mr. Trump’s case, his average approval score is 45 percent, according to Real Clear Politics.

The Trump campaign has spent years and presumably millions of dollars engaging white voters without college educations who are eligible to vote but did not vote in 2016. There are almost 1.5 million such potential voters in Michigan and more than two million in Pennsylvania.

But at the end of the day, much of the “hidden” vote stays hidden — that’s why voter turnout isn’t ever 100 percent, Mr. Blizzard said.

Beyond the polling, the fundamentals shaping the electorate, like the economy and the record-breaking coronavirus surge, are “increasingly ominous” for Mr. Trump, said Liam Donovan, a veteran Republican strategist.

“Ironically, the polls may be the best thing the Trump campaign has going for it at this point,” he said.

While Mr. Trump makes polling a punchline, both his campaign and the Republican National Committee rely on data to decide where to allocate resources. One of the murkiest issues is modeling which voters will turn out during a pandemic and an economic downturn.

And the Trump campaign has kept polling data secret since leaked internal polling early in the campaign prompted a shake-up of the polling team.

The campaign has been using various analyses, not all of which overlap. Traditional polling has been handled by the Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and John McLaughlin, who were hired when Brad Parscale, the previous campaign manager, was running the effort; Mr. Parscale’s deputy campaign manager, the former White House political director Bill Stepien, took over in July.

There has also been analysis by the former Cambridge Analytica official Matt Oczkowski, who is referred to as “Oz.” Mr. Kushner has held up Mr. Oczkowski’s analyses, which cut against public polling and suggest votes will break Mr. Trump’s way in the final days of the campaign, people who have heard the comments said.

The amount of polling from Mr. Fabrizio and Mr. McLaughlin has dwindled in recent weeks. Instead, Mr. Stepien quietly hired another pollster, Bill Skelly, who helped create the Republican National Committee’s complex modeling for voter turnout scenarios and who is conducting data analysis for the camp, and Brock McCleary, who has worked with clients who include congressional Republicans. Mr. McCleary’s estimates of Mr. Trump’s poll standing are less “negative” than some other Trump pollsters, according to people close to the campaign.

Mr. Parscale, who had worked fairly closely with the R.N.C., had envisioned continuous robust television ad spending through the year. Since he stepped aside, the Trump campaign, which has far less money than advisers had once anticipated, has slashed its television spending. Exactly what data has driven the allocation of the campaign’s remaining ad spending is unclear.

Two Republicans said that from the time Mr. Parscale was demoted until a meeting a few weeks ago, the campaign had not reviewed R.N.C. data that tracks specific voters and likelihood they’ll support the president. That meeting was convened by Mr. Kushner to get the campaign and the R.N.C. to work together more effectively. Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, denied that was the case, and a spokesman for the R.N.C. said the organizations were working effectively together.

The R.N.C. turnout models vary by state, but in some scenarios, it shows Mr. Trump performing worse than he does in the campaign’s own polls, two people briefed on the numbers said.

Nonetheless, that meeting led to a final $26 million television allocation led by the R.N.C.

Whether the weeks without a unified front between the campaign and the party committee will have been a significant factor in the outcome of the race remains to be seen. And whether the “hidden” voters the Trump team has sought matters more than a few percentage points is also unclear."
"Welcome to November. For Trump, the October Surprise Never Came.","President Trump began the fall campaign rooting for, and trying to orchestrate, a last-minute surprise that would vault him ahead of Joseph R. Biden Jr.

A coronavirus vaccine. A dramatic economic rebound. A blockbuster Justice Department investigation. A grievous misstep by a rival he portrayed as faltering. A scandal involving Mr. Biden and his son Hunter.

But as the campaign nears an end, and with most national and battleground-state polls showing Mr. Trump struggling, the cavalry of an October surprise that helped him overtake Hillary Clinton in 2016 has not arrived.

That has left Mr. Trump running on a record of an out-of-control pandemic, an economy staggered by disease, and questions about his own style and conduct that have made him a polarizing figure.

Some events that flashed across the political landscape gave Mr. Trump’s political circle hope for a lift: an opening on the Supreme Court, street protests that the president sought to blame on Democrats and even his three-day hospitalization with the coronavirus, which some advisers had hoped might make him more empathetic.

None of it appears to have made a difference. If anything, the come-and-go nature of what seemed like earth-moving moments underlined the central and fundamentally stable dynamics of the race. Opinions about Mr. Trump are largely set.

More than anything, the race was defined by the pandemic that exploded into the public consciousness in March and that Mr. Trump has struggled to manage as both a health care and a political issue.

The nation experienced a new spike in daily infections — almost 100,000 on Friday — as infections jumped in particular across the Midwest. “State nears shortage of ICU beds,” the banner headline in The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel warned on the eve of Mr. Trump’s visit to the battleground state of Wisconsin on Friday. The spiraling of bad news about the pandemic overwhelmed a glimmer of good economic news for the White House: a record increase in third-quarter economic growth.

“The October surprise happened in March,” said Mike DuHaime, a Republican strategist who managed the 2008 presidential bid for Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who is now one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers.

Jennifer Palmieri, a top adviser to Mrs. Clinton in 2016, said that “the underlying factors of life in America right now are so dramatic in and of themselves” that the idea that the race could be transformed by a news event, as happened with Mrs. Clinton in 2016, had always seemed like a long shot.

“A pandemic, an economic downturn,” she said. “People decided a long time ago which side they were on. In the end, October was not surprising. Not this year.”

Mr. Trump can still win on his own. He could repeat his 2016 Electoral College victory by turning out white blue-collar supporters who typically do not vote in large numbers and whom many pollsters undercounted last time. But the hurdle is higher. That improbable victory was the result of not only his resonant appeal to Americans alienated from the political establishment but also of events that rocked the final weeks of the campaign.

But Mr. Biden is not Mrs. Clinton. She did not have a reservoir of good will to help her overcome the rush of damaging news in the final weeks — in particular, the last-minute on-again, off-again investigation of her emails by James B. Comey, the director of the F.B.I.

By contrast, Mr. Trump survived even after the release of an audiotape — in October, of course — in which he was heard boasting of how he had grabbed women by the genitals without their consent. While polls in 2016 showed that many voters were choosing between two candidates they did not like, this time around, Mr. Biden is viewed favorably in many battleground states.

There is a history of October (or September) developments that upend the best planning of a candidate. Sometimes events happen that are beyond the control of either side, such as the last-minute release of a video message by Osama bin Laden in 2004. It was widely seen as giving a late boost to President George W. Bush, who had anchored his campaign against John F. Kerry with warnings about a potential reprise of the attacks of Sept. 11.

But often it is a campaign dropping negative information about an opponent that is timed to occur when voters are paying the most attention. In mid-October, The New York Post published an article suggesting improper foreign business dealings by Hunter Biden, based on questionable information provided by Mr. Giuliani reportedly from a computer hard drive — which Mr. Giuliani claimed belonged to the younger Mr. Biden — that had been left at a Delaware repair shop. The article captured attention in the conservative news media but didn’t appear to alter the race.

Some politicians wonder if the days of the October surprise are gone as they watch events slide by that would have changed the course of another election — the allegations about Hunter Biden or the Supreme Court fight.

“The now instant availability of information to test the credibility of claims decreases the likelihood they will be launched and increases the likelihood they could backfire,” said Tim Pawlenty, the former Republican governor of Minnesota, who ran for his party’s presidential nomination in 2012.

The two biggest external shocks to the race were the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the president’s hospitalization with the coronavirus in early October. Mr. Trump defied Democratic opposition in insisting on a confirmation vote before Election Day for Justice Ginsburg’s successor, Amy Coney Barrett. But it turned out to be a less electric battle than either side had expected, and there is little evidence it changed the dynamics of the presidential race.

Mr. Trump’s bout with Covid-19, rather than rallying Americans around him, crystallized the dangers of his laissez-faire approach to health guidelines and the centrality of the virus to American life.

“It’s easy to see how this election could have played out differently if the president’s behavior and policies had been different,” said David Wasserman, an editor at The Cook Political Report. “But the exogenous events — the bombshells of the Supreme Court vacancy and Trump’s illness — didn’t do much to alter the trajectory of the race. If anything, they marginally helped Biden.”

Mrs. Clinton has long argued that Mr. Comey’s letter announcing that he was reopening the email investigation was a major factor in her loss. “The principal reason why we ended up not winning those three states” — Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — “that we thought we were going to win was the Comey letter,” Mrs. Clinton told The New York Times for a recent podcast. “Because we could literally chart what happened from before and after.”

For months, Democrats have worried what Mr. Trump might do in the face of a tough re-election battle to gin up a game-changing moment, given his political history, which includes sending troops to the border in the days before the 2018 midterms and being impeached for soliciting damaging information from a foreign government on Mr. Biden.

But most of what Mr. Trump tried to do to shake up the race did not appear to work.

A Justice Department investigation he sought of the Obama administration’s role in examining his ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign will not be completed by Election Day. The federal government is not close to approving a vaccine. There was no big fall stimulus package. And a much-anticipated report ordered up by Senate Republicans into corruption allegations against Mr. Biden found no evidence of improper influence or wrongdoing by the former vice president.

That is not to say Mr. Trump did not try to use the levers of the government to shake up the race, and he has lashed out at cabinet officials who would not do his bidding.

He complained that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had not released emails from Mrs. Clinton that he said would reveal Democratic abuses intended to derail his 2016 campaign. He said that Attorney General William P. Barr would go down “as a very sad, sad situation” for failing to indict Democrats like Mr. Biden and former President Barack Obama.

As Mr. Trump travels the country, he complains at nearly every rally that the news media has not paid enough attention to his allegations against Hunter Biden. “Why isn’t Twitter trending Biden corruption? It’s the biggest, and most credible, story anywhere in the world. Fake Trending!!!” he wrote on Oct. 28.

His press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, walked to the back of Air Force One on a recent night to ask reporters following Mr. Trump on the campaign trail to watch Tucker Carlson interview Tony Bobulinski, a former business associate of Hunter Biden.

But even some members of Mr. Trump’s own party have shrugged off Mr. Trump’s assertions about the accusations against Hunter Biden, which have largely been confined to Fox News and other conservative outlets. “I don’t think it moves a single voter,” Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican whose own family was maligned by Mr. Trump during the 2016 primaries, told Axios.

Of course, some fear there could be a November surprise. Democrats, even as they view encouraging polls, worry that Mr. Trump and the Republicans could upend the election through suppression tactics and legal challenges that wind up before the Supreme Court.

Still, Mr. DuHaime said the conditions in 2020 set a high bar for a repeat of the external events that helped lift Mr. Trump late in 2016, which included not only the Comey letter but the damaging flood of emails stolen by Russia and released by WikiLeaks. And Mr. Biden, unlike Mrs. Clinton, has not spent 25 years as the target of conservative attacks.

“People aren’t suddenly going to believe you’re corrupt two weeks before the election,” he said.

"Trump, Venezuela and the Tug-of-War Over a Strongman","When President Trump turned to the Capitol gallery during his State of the Union speech in February to recognize Venezuela’s young opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, it seemed like a political masterstroke.

Mr. Guaidó’s surprise appearance — the culmination of efforts by foreign policy hawks to shift U.S. strategy in Latin America and dislodge Venezuela’s strongman president, Nicolás Maduro — prompted a standing ovation from Republicans and Democrats alike. “Maduro’s grip on tyranny will be smashed and broken,” Mr. Trump proclaimed. In the 2020 battleground of South Florida, home to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan expatriates and Cuban-Americans who support their cause, Mr. Trump’s embrace of Mr. Guaidó drew a rapturous response.

But on the eve of Election Day, Mr. Trump’s approach to Venezuela has yielded both some political success and a foreign policy failure. Although recent polls show Mr. Trump running close to his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., among Florida’s Latino voters, his administration’s harsh sanctions have failed to oust Mr. Maduro, while leaving Chinese, Russian and Iranian interests more firmly entrenched in Venezuela. Mr. Maduro has effectively vanquished Mr. Guaidó, whose popular support has collapsed.

Mr. Maduro’s survival is, in part, a parable of foreign policy in Mr. Trump’s Washington — where ideologues, donors and lobbyists compete to seize the attention of an inexperienced and highly transactional president, warping and reshaping American diplomacy along the way.

The tug-of-war over Mr. Trump’s Venezuela position pitted Cuban-American activists and Florida politicians, who viewed Mr. Maduro as a proxy and energy supplier for Cuba’s Communist regime, against pro-Trump business interests advocating closer engagement with Mr. Maduro.

They included a billionaire donor from Florida; top lobbyists who have earned millions in the influence-business boom of Mr. Trump’s first term; and a Venezuelan oligarch, now under federal indictment, who worked to broker U.S. investments in his country.

At stake was not only the welfare of Venezuelans, but also the flow of billions of dollars in their country’s crude oil — and, Mr. Trump came to believe, his re-election prospects.

As Mr. Maduro endures, a key architect of Mr. Trump’s Venezuela policy left his White House post in September. The same month, another official met secretly in Mexico with a Maduro ally in a last-ditch effort to persuade Mr. Maduro to step down — which Mr. Trump could have touted as a triumph before November.

A White House spokesman, John Ullyot, said Mr. Trump’s leadership had led to broad international pressure on Mr. Maduro. “The president continues to support the Venezuelan people to ensure a future that is democratic and prosperous,” he said.

But some former officials who favored a tougher stance on Venezuela now question the administration’s approach.

“There is a very strong consideration for the donors, for the swing voters in Florida and for those that are just ideologically pure on the evilness of Cuba,” said Fernando Cutz, who worked on the National Security Council for Mr. Trump and his predecessor. “The nuance is gone — the diplomacy.”

In spring 2017, Brian Ballard, a lobbyist and top Trump fund-raiser from Florida, hosted a meeting with two people who would play a role in the struggle over Venezuela’s future.

One was Raúl Gorrín, who had amassed a fortune under Venezuela’s socialist government while building close ties to both Mr. Maduro and the opposition. He was among a wave of foreign interests reaching out to Mr. Ballard, who had recently opened a Washington office to meet the demand for lobbyists close to the new administration.

The other guest was Mauricio Claver-Carone, a longtime lobbyist on Cuba policy and a ferocious defender of the embargo. He had landed at the Treasury Department after working on the Trump campaign but had ambitions for a foreign policy role. Mr. Claver-Carone declined to comment.

As the two men talked alone, their conversation grew testy, according to Mr. Gorrín, 51. Mr. Claver-Carone insisted that the regime was close to collapse; Mr. Gorrín argued that Mr. Maduro was firmly in control and that the United States and Venezuela would benefit from a thaw.

“You don’t know Venezuela,” he recalled saying.

Mr. Trump, a mutual object of interest, had unformed views but was curious about Venezuela, piqued by its vast oil wealth and by the country’s dominance of the Miss Universe contest, which he once owned, according to two former White House aides.

He was also focused on re-election. “Trump saw Venezuela 110 percent through the prism of Florida’s electoral votes,” said a former senior U.S. official, who requested anonymity to characterize private conversations.

Mr. Trump heard often from Marco Rubio, the Cuban-American senator from Florida, who advised tougher sanctions. Under Mr. Maduro’s leadership, the economy of the once-wealthy country had cratered, its health system failed and opposition was often met with violence.

But Mr. Trump swung between belligerence that unnerved even his hawkish aides and supreme confidence in his negotiating skills. In summer 2017, while musing publicly about invading Venezuela, he also asked advisers whether he should meet with Mr. Maduro, according to one of the aides.

“We were always fearful that he would want to exercise that option,” said the former aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “You can’t say no. We said, ‘It’s going to be bad for your image, and he’s going to manipulate you.’”

That summer, Mr. Gorrín’s media company hired Mr. Ballard. Both men agree that Mr. Gorrín wanted help placing his Globovisión network on American television, where it might grow into a Spanish-language Fox News. Associates of Mr. Gorrín said he also hoped the lobbyist could establish him as a player in Washington on Venezuela policy, making key introductions. (Mr. Gorrín said Mr. Ballard proposed the middleman role; the lobbyist denied that and said he made no introductions.)

The Venezuelan said that Mr. Ballard connected him to Harry Sargeant III, a billionaire Trump donor from Florida who had worked in Venezuela in the 1990s. Mr. Sargeant, 62, saw Venezuela’s oil reserves as a business opportunity and the key to energy independence for the Americas.

Mr. Gorrín, in turn, helped arrange for Mr. Sargeant to meet state oil company officials in Caracas; when he arrived, he found himself in a session with Mr. Maduro as well. In an interview, Mr. Sargeant said he told Mr. Maduro that Venezuela needed American businesses to help rebuild its economy.

Soon after, one of Mr. Sargeant’s companies began negotiating a deal to take over three dilapidated oil fields. In summer 2018, Mr. Sargeant flew with an associate to see Mr. Trump at a New York fund-raiser, trying — unsuccessfully — to deliver a letter from Mr. Maduro.

In Washington, the hard-liners had been gaining ground. Mr. Trump fired Rex W. Tillerson, his secretary of state, in early 2018 and installed John Bolton, a veteran hawk, as national security adviser. In the White House, Mr. Rubio’s view — maximum pressure on Mr. Maduro — prevailed, with the State Department playing a diminishing role.

After Mr. Maduro won a second term in an election widely denounced as a sham, the Trump administration imposed new sanctions.

With support from Mr. Rubio and others, Mr. Bolton hired Mr. Claver-Carone that August to run Western Hemisphere affairs on the National Security Council. The administration began preparing economic penalties that would target Mr. Maduro’s inner circle and the oil assets he depended on for hard currency.

Later that fall, Mr. Claver-Carone met Mr. Sargeant for drinks near the White House. Mr. Sargeant had recently finalized the oil deal, one of the most favorable that Venezuela had granted to a foreign business in years. Mr. Maduro had allowed the project, he told Mr. Claver-Carone, to show that he wanted better relations with the United States.

Mr. Claver-Carone was unmoved, Mr. Sargeant recalled. There was only one message the official wanted to hear from Mr. Maduro: where the Venezuelan president wanted to live in exile, whom he wanted to accompany him and how much money he wanted to take.

In early 2019, the White House rallied an international coalition to recognize Mr. Guaidó, head of Venezuela’s National Assembly, as the country’s rightful president. Speaking to a Miami crowd that February, Mr. Trump urged the Venezuelan military to back Mr. Guaidó or “lose everything.”

By then, according to two Venezuelan opposition leaders and a former Trump administration official, Mr. Claver-Carone and others were pressing Venezuela’s military and political elite to turn on Mr. Maduro.

“He had to deliver a win,” the former administration official said. “He sold it to the president as, ‘if you get rid of Maduro, you win’” in Florida.

Among those Mr. Claver-Carone contacted, according to the opposition leaders, was Mr. Gorrín.

By then, he was technically a fugitive from American justice. The prior summer, U.S. prosecutors had charged him in an alleged money-laundering scheme. He dismissed the indictment as political persecution, but Mr. Ballard had dropped him as a client and Mr. Gorrín was added to the sanctions list.

Now, American officials and the Venezuelan opposition needed back channels of their own. According to the opposition leaders, Mr. Gorrín and other intermediaries were asked to convey U.S. offers of leniency to cooperative regime figures.

Mr. Gorrín had attended university with the chief justice of Venezuela’s supreme court; the Americans believed they had a deal with Mr. Gorrín to help deliver the judge and others to Mr. Guaidó's side. That March, the Trump administration quietly took Mr. Gorrín’s wife off the sanctions list.

Mr. Gorrín, whose discussions with regime figures were reported by The Wall Street Journal last year, denied playing any role in the effort, and said he had no contact with Mr. Claver-Carone after their 2017 meeting.

An attempted uprising failed. The promised supreme court ruling never materialized. Mass demonstrations led by Mr. Guaidó fizzled, and Mr. Maduro deployed paramilitaries to torture and kill protesters.

Mr. Sargeant, whose oil deal had been scuttled by the new sanctions, saw an opening. That summer, he teamed up with Robert Stryk, a lobbyist who had earned millions representing foreign leaders in Washington. Mr. Stryk’s White House contacts told him that the president felt misled by his advisers on Venezuela. Eager to cut foreign policy deals that administration hawks opposed, Mr. Trump was clashing with Mr. Bolton. By September, he was gone.

The next month, Mr. Sargeant and Mr. Stryk flew to Caracas to meet with Mr. Maduro. When they arrived in the presidential palace, there was another guest: Mr. Gorrín.

Mr. Maduro seemed to brush off reports of Mr. Gorrín’s role in the failed April uprising. “He’s my guy,” Mr. Maduro remarked, according to another person present at the meeting. Mr. Maduro waxed about American baseball and said he was willing to let U.S. drug enforcement agents back into the country.

Mr. Stryk proposed a plan to secure formal legal representation for Mr. Maduro in Washington — a revived diplomatic channel. Mr. Maduro picked up a Trump figurine made of chocolate and mimed shaking his hand.

“We’re all having a meeting now,” he said.

Nothing would come of the effort. After Mr. Stryk and a law firm filed disclosure forms revealing their proposed work for the regime, the blowback was severe. Senator Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, pledged to blackball all the firm’s clients unless it withdrew. It did.

The Trump administration’s drive to unseat Mr. Maduro also faltered. He brushed off a White House proposal in March that he and Mr. Guaidó step aside in favor of a transitional government.

Mr. Maduro’s opponents grew desperate. In May, a group of radical opposition sympathizers, former military officers and American mercenaries tried to invade Venezuela by speedboats. The operation was ambushed. The attempted coup became a political one for Mr. Maduro, when documents linked one of Mr. Guaidó’s advisers to the putsch.

In scripted settings, Mr. Trump has remained committed to his administration’s hard-line policies. In a July appearance in Florida, he contrasted his attacks on Mr. Maduro with what he characterized as the socialist-friendly policies of Mr. Biden.

But in an interview with Axios in June, Mr. Trump had distanced himself from Mr. Guaidó, and suggested he was open to meeting Mr. Maduro. The president’s Twitter feed, once filled with denunciations of the Maduro regime, went all but silent on the topic this fall. By then, Mr. Claver-Carone was on his way out, to an influential job running the Inter-American Development Bank.

“It is a shame where we are right now,” said Steve Goldstein, a former top State Department aide to Mr. Tillerson. “Maduro should not be the president of Venezuela.”

We Have Never Had Final Results on Election Day,"For weeks, President Trump and his allies have been laying groundwork to challenge the results of the election if he loses. Now, in the final days of the campaign, he has settled on a blatantly ahistorical closing argument: that the votes in a fair election should not be counted past election night.

“The Election should end on November 3rd., not weeks later!” he tweeted on Friday, two days after telling reporters in Nevada, “Hopefully, the few states remaining that want to take a lot of time after Nov. 3 to count ballots, that won’t be allowed by the various courts.”

“You would think you want to have the votes counted, tabulated, finished by the evening of Nov. 3,” he said at a campaign event a week earlier.

In reality, the scenario Mr. Trump is outlining — every vote in a modern election being “counted, tabulated, finished” by midnight — is not possible and never has been. No state ever reports final results on election night, and no state is legally expected to.

transcript

This year, as the president has been talking about— “Fraud like you’ve never seen. They have these fake ballots. They’re trying to rig an election, and we can’t let that happen. I hope you’re all going to be poll watchers.” “His language has taken on an almost militaristic tone.” “Go into the polls and watch very carefully. Be poll watchers when you go there. Watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do.” There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in U.S. elections. Still, the president talks about recruiting an army of poll watchers. “It’s taken on such an aggressive nature in a way that we’ve kind of never seen before. It’s very frightening to election officials.” “It paints poll watching with a veneer of antagonism, combat and not in the spirit of protecting our elections.” But it’s more than just rhetoric. This year, the Republican Party can throw its full weight behind the president’s poll watching operations in ways we haven’t seen for nearly 40 years. To understand why, let’s take a trip back in time — “Wherever I go, people ask me what a New Jersey vacation is like” — to a governor’s race in New Jersey in 1981. “When I ran in that election, it was a very interesting election, to say the least.” This was the Democratic candidate James Florio. And here he is now. “That’s a long time ago, that’s 40 years ago.” The race was an early referendum on the Reagan administration. “I like Tom Kean.” “Kean has endorsed Reaganomics and proposed cuts in state taxes on business. The Democratic candidate, Congressman James Florio, attacks both Reagan’s and Kean’s economic plan.” “We thought it would be an election on the merits of the issues” — “revitalizing our railroads, cleaning up toxic waste, strengthening law enforcement” — “turned out that was not all involving the merits.” It was the closest fought election in the history of the state. But as it turns out, it wasn’t a clean fight. “Election day yielded some surprises to a lot of people who went to the polls because people saw off duty policemen with armbands that said ‘members of the Ballot Security Task Force.’” “That’s the Republican group, which according to state Democrats, intimidated some minority voters.” “It looked very official. And they were standing there with their guns.” “They obstructed voters from casting ballots. But also they obstructed access by poll workers.” More than 200 task force members showed up at the polls, confronting voters in Democratic strongholds. They were in Newark but not in Short Hills. They were in Trenton but not Princeton. And Camden but not in Cherry Hill. “If you look at the demographics of the neighborhoods that were targeted for these efforts, they were all predominantly Black and Latinx neighborhoods. White voters were not targeted in the same way at all.” “So it was clear that they’re not concerned about ballot integrity. They’re concerned about intimidation. It was a very clever, sinister initiative.” In the end, Florio lost by a razor thin margin. “1,797 votes out of 2.3 million votes. The intimidation had an impact on the outcome of the election.” “It’s a case of sour grapes from Democrats that don’t know how to take defeat.” But this wasn’t just a local effort. Investigations suggested that the task force was organized and paid for by the Republican National Committee. “A covert operation that was at the very least intentionally misleading and resulted in technical violations of our election laws.” Democrats sued the R.N.C. for violating the Voting Rights Act. The R.N.C. was forced to enter into a federal consent decree that would restrict them for years to come. “For the better part of the past four decades, the Republican National Party has been under a consent decree that has limited their ability to coordinate some of these poll watching activities.” “So it created a mechanism that deterred any additional voter intimidation and also created a check on future R.N.C. efforts that might target minority communities.” Under the terms of the consent decree, the R.N.C. had to get court approval for poll watching plans. The party tried unsuccessfully to get out of it for many years. “And they were found to be in violation of the consent decree at least three times since it was put into place.” Then in 2017, the court allowed the consent decree to expire, setting up a different kind of fight in 2020. “This will be the first presidential election where we will see the Republican National Party operating a poll watching operation without the consent decree hovering over their heads. Now that it has been lifted, it looks like there is going to be a more organized and a bigger poll watching operation coming out of the Republican National Party.” Republicans say they’re training more than 50,000 poll watchers in at least 15 battleground states. They’ve released a series of carefully worded training presentations for volunteers. “Poll watchers are the first line of defense for President Trump. Be courteous to county staff and other watchers. Yes, even our Democrat friends. Do not speak with voters and do not interfere with the orderly conduct of the voting process.” Their presence at the polls is perfectly legal if they follow the rules. In early voting this year, there have been a few potential violations. Pennsylvania’s attorney general called out illegal surveillance of a ballot dropbox in Philadelphia. And local news in Florida reported on two armed private security guards who posted themselves near an early voting site. “Two armed security guards showed up outside of the downtown St. Pete early voting location.” “Pretty much ever since the president has been calling on his supporters to watch the polls, election officials and law enforcement agencies across the country have kind of been preparing for what may be an influx of people who don’t know the rules and regulations of poll watching.” In a statement, the R.N.C. said its poll watchers have received rigorous training to follow state laws and are not there to be intimidating. “The big unknown is exactly how big and how widespread the deployment of these poll watchers will be and whether they will have any kind of marching orders from the Republican Party or the Trump campaign to really question a bunch of voters’ eligibility or whether they’ll just kind of follow the more traditional ways.” Ultimately, the consent decree offered a legal shortcut to stop the R.N.C.’s poll watching operations if they crossed the line. “What’s important to keep in mind is that the tactics that were unlawful in 1980 are just as unlawful in 2020. There has never been permission for any political party or any private party to engage in racially targeted voter intimidation or voter intimidation of any sort. And so we’re not without protection. We’re not without tools to combat it. But we do have one less in our arsenal.” “If we see a resumption of the same type of thing this time, we’ll have to go back to court. I can be authoritatively the person that can be definitive and say that small margins make a big difference.”

Americans are accustomed to knowing who won on election night because news organizations project winners based on partial counts, not because the counting is actually completed that quickly. These race calls mean Candidate A is far enough ahead that, given the number of outstanding ballots and the regions those ballots are coming from, Candidate B would realistically be unable to close the gap.

The difference this year is not the timing of final results — those will come, as always, by the certification deadlines each state has set, ranging from two days after the election in Delaware to more than a month after in California. The difference, rather, is when news organizations are likely to have enough information to make accurate projections.

If, as Mr. Trump suggested, courts were to force states to stop counting after Nov. 3, it would be an extraordinary subversion of the electoral process and would disenfranchise millions of voters who cast valid, on-time ballots.

“Everyone — including Joe Biden, the Democrat Party, the mainstream media and the American public — should want election results they can trust and for every valid ballot to count,” said Thea McDonald, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump’s campaign. “President Trump and Republicans have long fought for these key principles of our democracy, and in many states won, in the fight against Democrats’ attempts to effectively delay Election Day.”

Ms. McDonald pointed to efforts in some states to accept ballots that are received late if the postmark is not clear and said this was “exactly the kind of late ballot counting President Trump has been fighting to prevent.”

But Mr. Trump has explicitly criticized the counting and tabulating of votes past Election Day, something that will happen no matter when the ballot receipt deadline is. Ms. McDonald declined to explain or clarify those statements on the record.

Mail ballots tend to take longer to process than in-person votes, and millions more people are voting by mail this year than ever before because of the pandemic. Because the voters choosing to do this are disproportionately Democrats, neither in-person ballots nor mail ballots will be representative of the full vote count.

Counting votes by mail involves multiple steps, and in several critical swing states, that process doesn’t begin until Election Day or very close to it.

And because of the intense confusion around voting rules, more voters than usual may have to cast provisional ballots, meaning election officials will have to verify their eligibility before counting their votes.

In some states — like Colorado, which has been conducting elections by mail for years, or Florida, which allows officials to begin processing mail-in ballots before Election Day — it may still be possible to call winners on election night, depending on how close the races are.

But in many other states — including the all-important Pennsylvania, where some counties will not begin counting mail-in ballots until Nov. 4 because of limited resources — it could take several days to get an accurate picture.

If this happens, it will be evidence not of a conspiracy but of the electoral system working as it should, by counting every vote. And while much about this year’s election is abnormal, delayed results would not be. Even in the smoothest elections, we don’t necessarily get quick calls in close races.

On election night in 2018, it wasn’t clear who had won governor’s races in Florida, Georgia and Wisconsin; Senate races in Arizona and Florida; and a slew of House races in California, Georgia, New York, Texas and Utah. While there were recounts and legal disputes in a handful of these races, the uncertainty in most places had nothing to do with changing or challenging the counts — it just took time to finish counting.

If the tallies had been frozen at midnight, even many in-person votes would not have been counted. And the ballots tallied after Election Day did not uniformly benefit one party.

In Minnesota’s First Congressional District, for instance, they benefited the Republican candidate, Jim Hagedorn, who was ahead by fewer than 100 votes just after midnight but ended up winning by about 1,300 votes. In California’s 21st Congressional District, they benefited the Democratic candidate, T.J. Cox, who appeared to be losing on election night but ended up winning by about 850 votes.

When we talk about delayed results, it is easy to think of a nightmare scenario like the 2000 presidential election in Florida: a race close enough to trigger a recount, in a tipping-point state, with clear ballot irregularities that can’t easily be resolved, ultimately decided not by the count but by the courts.

But most of the time, the circumstances are much more anodyne, and the results are finalized with no serious questions about their legitimacy.

Few people are likely to remember that it took two weeks to call Missouri for John McCain in 2008, because the election didn’t hinge on the outcome. When the state finally was called on Nov. 19, by a margin of about 0.1 percent, The New York Times reported simply, “The Missouri secretary of state’s office had been waiting for some jurisdictions to examine thousands of provisional ballots and certify and mail in their totals.”

In 2012, it took four days to call Florida for President Barack Obama — and again it was not particularly memorable, because he had already won re-election without the state. While there were plenty of recriminations about how long the counting took, the results themselves were not disputed.

Four years later, Michigan counted ballots for more than two weeks after the Nov. 8 election before delivering Mr. Trump one of his most cherished victories.

“The Great State of Michigan was just certified as a Trump WIN,” he tweeted after that, “giving all of our MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN supporters another victory — 306!”"
"Signs Get Snatched, Kicked, Burned as Political Battle Reaches the Front Lawn","CHICAGO — In Illinois, Florida and Arizona, police officers have been summoned to investigate Biden signs set ablaze and Trump flags swiped in the night. Homeowners, angry over their campaign signs disappearing, have set up elaborate motion-activated cameras to catch the culprits. A sneaky few have booby-trapped signs with sharp razor blades glinting underneath.

With the presidential election only days away, Americans are lining up against one another, sometimes right in their own front yards.

“There’s just a lot of bad feelings now, and this is what it comes to,” said Annie Phillips, 82, a retired educator in suburban Seattle who had two Biden signs stolen from her front yard. “I’m holding my breath until the election is settled.”

Fed up after her second sign was taken, Ms. Phillips bought a third one and nailed it to her garage door.

Americans are bubbling over with tension and dread. They have endured a long, combative campaign in the midst of a pandemic and a complicated voting process with an uncertain outcome. 

Both sides are reporting acts of political vandalism.

Paul Barden, of Normandy Park, Wash., was puttering around his house on a quiet street last month when an unfamiliar white car, slowing to a stop outside, briefly caught his eye through the window.

He thought little of it until later, when he stepped outside and made an infuriating discovery: His brand-new Trump flag, carefully hung earlier that day from tiny hooks under the eaves, had vanished. Whoever had filched it was long gone.

“A lowlife sneak thief,” he railed on the app Nextdoor, informing his neighbors of the incident.

To Mr. Barden, a former Republican state representative who had served in the Marines, the incident distilled everything that seemed to be happening around him in the country lately. A lack of civility and decorum. A growing sense of chaos. 

“And yet I hadn’t noticed it manifesting itself in my little corner of the world,” Mr. Barden said last week. “Until my flag was taken.” 

Skirmishes over yard signs, flags and other expressions of candidate loyalty emerge with regularity every election season, but this year seems more intense. 

In Volusia County, Fla., a neighbor punched another in the face because he believed that his own Trump sign was blocked by his neighbor’s Biden sign, the authorities said.

Trump-Pence signs have been defaced with stickers. Biden-Harris signs have been kicked down in the grass. In central Iowa, a Trump sign along a highway was partially covered with a sheet of black metal spray-painted with Bible verse: “Love One Another. John 15.” On a country road in northeastern Wisconsin this fall, a large Biden sign stood pockmarked with fist-sized holes, flaps of shorn sign fluttering in the wind.

A Trump sign, booby-trapped with hidden razor blades, injured a worker in Michigan who was moving it because it had been placed too close to a roadway, sending him to the hospital to get his bloodied hand stitched up.

The tumult comes as the demand for campaign signs has exploded in some regions. Steven Slugocki, chairman of the Democratic Party in Maricopa County, Ariz., said he was seeing ten times as many requests for signs as in 2016. 

“It’s this interesting dynamic because everybody wants a sign, but people get a sign and it gets stolen,” he said. “It does make people a little more hesitant to put it up, especially in the front yard, but demand has been through the roof.”

Scott Dressel, public information officer for the Highlands County, Fla., sheriff’s department, became so fed up with sign wars in his county that he took to Facebook with a post begging residents to knock it off.

“Guess this is a message we are going to have to put out every election season from now on because people don’t know how to behave like rational adults: DON’T STEAL OR DEFACE CAMPAIGN SIGNS,” he wrote. (He suggested that they vote, write a letter to the editor or cover their cars in political bumper stickers instead.)

Mr. Dressel said he had been set off by the events of the weekend prior.

One particular neighborhood, which happened to be his own, was hit hard by people stealing Biden signs. Not long afterward, somebody — or somebodies — defaced a line of Trump signs on a main highway that runs through the county.

“They sprayed a big ‘X’ on them, sprayed other things on there that I can’t repeat,” Mr. Dressel said. “We realize everybody’s tense. I’m 50 years old and I’ve never seen a presidential election that has been this antagonistic.”

Entire roads have been turned into sign battlefields.

In Murrysville, Pa., the “Route 22 battle royale,” as described by the Pittsburgh Tribune Review, began innocently enough. On one side of the road, supporters of Mr. Trump turned a former salon into a “Trump Victory Center,” decked out in red, white and blue. Less than half a mile away, volunteers in favor of Mr. Biden staked out ground in a medical office building, complete with a cutout of the former vice president, smiling and wearing a blue face mask.

When local Republicans held a rally that was expected to draw hundreds of cars along Route 22, Democrats executed a “blitz,” lining the road with signs supporting Biden-Harris. 

“It feels like a war,” said Michelle McFall, a local Democratic organizer who helped form the grass-roots group for Mr. Biden. “People are holding their ground as they would in battle, and they are strategically planning their actions and counter actions.”

By the next day, the Republicans had put up counter messages taking aim at Mr. Biden’s long political career: “Drain the Swamp.”

Jill Cooper, the local chairwoman for the Trump Victory Center on Route 22, said they are working hard to turn out the vote and positioned themselves on a main road to send a message to Republican voters.

“They can be proud to support the president, that they are not racist, they are not xenophobic, they are not sexist, things the media and other people always accuse us of,” Ms. Cooper said. “That’s why we’re on 22, where 30,000 cars go by a day. We want them to know: ‘You are not alone.’”

On one farm in western Massachusetts last month, one act of campaign destruction went far beyond swiping signs back and forth.

Ruth Crane and her husband, Dicken, who is a fourth-generation farmer, decided to spray-paint a display of hay bales with the words “Biden Harris,” letting passing motorists know of their support for the Democratic presidential ticket.

It was only the next day when Ms. Crane received a frantic call: Someone had lit the bales on fire, burning the entire display to the ground.

The community, a mix of Republicans and Democrats, poured donations and messages of support to the Cranes. A man was quickly arrested and charged with the crime. 

“It was a bit of a wake-up to people,” Ms. Crane said. “We received that message from a lot of people, from both sides, who said, ‘This is out of hand.’”

Pastors at the Polls? Meet Ohio’s Election Protection Squad,"From across Ohio, ministers, chaplains and social workers who have volunteered to deploy to the polls dialed in to a videoconference to hear nine hypothetical situations they might encounter on Election Day, from people refusing to wear masks to politicians pressuring those in line to vote for them.

Then the callers were confronted with one final scenario that troubled them the most.

“Voter A comes to the line carrying a handgun: What do you do?” asked the Rev. Joan Van Becelaere, a minister and the executive director of the Unitarian Universalist Justice of Ohio.

Ohio’s clergy are at the forefront of an unusual effort to ensure an orderly election. This year, voting rights groups are recruiting them from around the state to head to the polls — even asking them to wear their clerical garb at polling stations — in an effort to calm a polarized electorate as it casts ballots in the most tense election season in generations.

They call themselves the “peacekeepers.”

“A guy once came up to me and pointed a gun in my face and said, ‘I need food,’” said Ms. Van Becelaere, recalling an incident from years back when she worked in a soup kitchen. “I took a deep breath. I said we had food, and welcomed him in. Pretty soon the gun was at his side.”

Experiences defusing situations like that, Ms. Van Becelaere said, could prove useful again.

The loudest alarm bells in recent American elections have had to do with foreign interference from countries like Russia. Voting rights groups have campaigned against identification requirements and voter roll purges that have disenfranchised voters. Poll monitors have tried to ensure that ballots were counted accurately and have assembled legal teams to investigate irregularities.

These problems still exist, but the possibility of violence this Tuesday is a new and real concern to many. President Trump has refused to say whether he would accept an election loss, and during the first debate in October, he called on the Proud Boys, a far-right group known for attacking peaceful protesters, to “stand back and stand by.”

This has left voting rights groups treading a fine line in their efforts this year: They want voters to feel that they are unlikely to encounter problems or intimidation, but that if a conflict does arise somewhere, there is a plan to confront it.

“One thing we know to be true is that intimidation can be as much psychology as physical action,” said Jen Miller, executive director of the League of Women Voters in Ohio. “What we don’t want is people to expect intimidation and skip out on voting.”

It’s not only clergy members who are part of the effort. After anti-abortion groups began harassing people casting ballots early in October, the Election Protection coalition, a nonpartisan group in Ohio, began recruiting musicians to create musical distractions at lines where tensions were building. The group may even hire magicians to that end.

In North Carolina, the Poor People’s Campaign, an anti-poverty group, organized 5,000 clergy members across the country to assist voters ahead of the Nov. 3 election, a group it calls the “prophetic council.” Last weekend, when a conservative group threatened to send operatives to follow a community leader in Greensboro, N.C., whom they accused of voter fraud, pastors were sent to ensure she was not harassed, according to the Rev. William Barber II, a minister with the group.

“We didn’t engage in an escalating way; we know how to do it,” he said.

The Ohio clergy members got a taste last weekend for the tensions that may be ahead in the city of New Philadelphia. A Unitarian pastor was sent to the town, 50 miles south of Akron, after armed Republicans and Democrats congregated near an early polling site. Both sides eventually dispersed and fired no shots.

During the training, Ms. Van Becelaere outlined techniques to de-escalate other conflicts that might arise. Offer water to someone who is getting angry, she said. If a group comes to harass people in line, try singing “Happy Birthday” loudly to create a distraction.

The pastor played an instructional video on how to corral people who are intimidating voters by surrounding the aggressors in a horseshoe shape, shielding voters while giving the intruders a way to easily leave the scene.

As representatives of the clergy, the pastors hope they will be more easily trusted by both sides than the partisan election monitors who might also be present on Election Day. And unlike the police, who might be called to arbitrate a dispute, many of the pastors have experience disarming violent situations without the use of weapons.

During the training, Joseph R. Henry, a retired chaplain in Cincinnati, recalled a time in the 1970s when he was doing charity work as a seminary student, and a man grabbed him by the tie and threatened to throw him over a railing. By staying calm and not fighting back, Mr. Henry said he was able to defuse the situation and escape.

“I knew he had me if he wanted me, but I managed to talk him out of it,” Mr. Henry said.

The Rev. Angie Cox, a pastor at Broad Street United Methodist Church in Columbus, said she was less worried about armed people arriving to intimidate voters than she was about voters showing up with legal weapons under Ohio’s open-carry laws.

Ms. Cox said that she has had trouble persuading residents not to enter her church armed, despite signs saying weapons are not allowed.

“People can be pretty bold about this and just say, ‘I’m going in,’” Ms. Cox said.

In such situations, not forcing the person to disarm is the best way to avoid escalation, she said.

The pastors were hard-pressed to think of another election where violence was such a concern at the polls. Some thought of disputed elections in other countries. Others remembered social justice campaigns they had participated in during the 1960s, when the Vietnam War formed the backdrop of presidential elections.

This time would be different, Ms. Van Becelaere said — the clergy are arriving not as activists but as neutral parties, with the goal of making sure that everyone is comfortable casting a vote.

And if conflict does arise, settling it is ultimately not the church’s job.

“We don’t jump in like Mighty Mouse to save the day,” Ms. Van Becelaere said."
"Ahead of Election, Police Prepare for Violence and Disruption","The Las Vegas Police had a quandary. They were on high alert for election-related threats, but when long lines of voters began snaking down streets and around parking lots two weeks ago, they feared that stationing patrol cars outside polling stations might drive people away.

“How do you make people feel safe in that environment without creating an overt police presence — that is a challenge for all police departments,” said Andrew Walsh, deputy chief in the Homeland Security division of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. They decided that frequent but random patrols to look for potential trouble was the better choice.

Striking that balance is at the root of many of the challenges facing law enforcement agencies nationwide as they prepare for an election rife with uncertainties. The largest departments have run practice drills on scenarios including violent clashes between Biden and Trump supporters, the sudden appearance of an armed paramilitary group, a cyberattack or a bomb.

“This is such a polarized environment and a lot of people are angry,” said John D. Cohen, a former Homeland Security counterterrorism coordinator with 34 years experience in law enforcement. “I have never seen a threat environment as dynamic, complex and dangerous as the one we are in right now.”

Police in Las Vegas — like their counterparts in New York, Detroit, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles and in other cities all across the country — are grappling with deploying significantly more officers to counteract any disturbances without scaring voters away.

So far, cities have stayed mostly quiet. And law enforcement officials like John Miller, the Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism for the New York Police Department, have stressed that no “parade of terribles” has materialized so far.

As Election Day nears, many senior law enforcement and other officials have attempted to inject calm while simultaneously warning of dire consequences for those who would disrupt voting.

The attorney general in Ohio, Dave Yost, a Republican, warned that nobody would be allowed to break the law by blocking people from voting. “Hands off the polling places, hands off the vote,” he said in a video statement.

At the same time, many jurisdictions have sought to educate both the public and law enforcement of what is permissible at the polls. Larry Krasner, the Democratic district attorney in Philadelphia, issued a six-page memo on the law to the police, noting for example that anyone can face five years in jail for a misdemeanor if they “unlawfully strike, wound or commit an assault and battery upon the person of any elector” in or near a polling place.

His office will deploy a task force of 80 prosecutors and county detectives on Election Day, up from 60 for previous presidential races. Mr. Krasner warned that anyone “dressed up as G.I. Joe” and trying to intimidate voters would face trial in Philadelphia.

Battleground election states like Pennsylvania, with a history of both leftist activists and armed, far-right groups, are being watched closely for potential violence. So too are Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, Georgia and Oregon. Nationwide, five protesters have been shot dead during clashes in recent months.

Much attention is focused on Michigan given the early October arrest of 14 men linked to a paramilitary group and accused of violent plots, including kidnapping Gov. Gretchen Whitmer over her coronavirus lockdown orders.

Elections officials in some cities there have trained poll workers to deal with disruptive people at the polls or aggressive challengers at absentee vote counting boards.

In the city of Pontiac, Garland Doyle, the city clerk, said every polling station would post a worker outdoors to monitor activity.

James Craig, the Detroit police chief, said the department would be out “en masse,” not at polling stations but nearby, and Dana Nessel, the state attorney general, said that would be true across Michigan.

“There won’t be law enforcement at the polls, but they’ll be ready to go if there are bad actors who are engaging in intimidation or threatening behavior and dispersing people if they’re causing trouble,” she said.

In New York City, longstanding local laws mandate that at least one officer be deployed at each of the 1,201 polling stations, but hundreds more will be on standby. Chief Terence A. Monahan said the lesson from the large demonstrations this summer was that police had to reach the scene of disturbances faster, and more officers have been given a refresher course in public disorder training. “There will be a lot of cops out there,” he said.

Urban departments are not the only ones concerned about disruptions. Sheriff David Davis of Bibb County, Ga., said that a deputy would be stationed at each of the county’s 31 polling places at the request of the local Board of Elections.

Many police officials and extremism experts said that they were more worried about the period after Nov. 3, especially if no clear winner emerges.

Some adherents of the far right view the election as an opportunity to incite violence and accelerate their goal of a civil war. “For the far right this moment is really a flash point,” said Cassie Miller, a senior research analyst on extremist groups for the Southern Poverty Law Center.

The postelection period often pops up on forums frequented by paramilitary types. “Past Nov. 3 the gloves come off,” one person wrote recently on such a forum.

A few leaders of larger paramilitary groups with chapters sprinkled across the country have said their members will deploy on Election Day, but the track record on members actually showing up for planned events is mixed.

If any armed paramilitary groups mobilize, experts said, it will likely be an ad hoc, local situation, much like the men who appeared within hours in Kenosha, Wis., in late August after a resident issued a call to arms on Facebook. Much hinges on President Trump himself, they said.

“If President Trump or the right-wing media begin putting out the message that there is voter fraud or something irregular, that could be something that could bring people out to polling places pretty rapidly,” said Ms. Miller.

In Los Angeles, the police chief, Michel Moore, said the Michigan plot underscored the fact that a small group of similarly minded people could easily try to carry out a symbolic or disruptive act.

The department is training 120 officers a day in crowd management and is closely tracking new tactics used by those who take advantage of protests to cause disruption, he said. The L.A.P.D. has purchased 10,000 pairs of glasses to protect against attacks with industrial-grade lasers.

In Chicago, days off have been canceled and officers notified that their shifts might extend to 12 hours.

Cities are also taking steps to prepare for possible riots or looting. In Beverly Hills, officials said that they would shut down glitzy Rodeo Drive, warning stores that they might want to board up their windows against the kinds of protests that erupted over the summer.

National Guard units were also being called out in various states, including New Jersey, Wisconsin and Texas. Officials in the first two said the dearth of poll-station volunteers amid the pandemic meant a few hundred troops in civilian clothing would be needed to help count absentee ballots and other poll activities.

For Election Day, New Jersey staged its first statewide practice run combining the efforts of law enforcement and election officials from each of 21 counties more than a year ago, said Jared M. Maples, director of the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness. The Office ramped up training to respond to cyberattacks on polling places from either foreign or domestic sources, and on how to use official social media accounts to debunk election disinformation, he said.

In Houston, Chief Art Acevedo said that this year is the first in his long career when members of the public have asked about election safety.

“You have a sitting president already calling into question the election itself and whether or not it’s a fixed election,” he said. “So you’re worried about if he loses, people actually believing that the election is fixed. And so when you put all that together and all the conflict in the country, we are worried. I think that most police chiefs are worried.”

He Already Saw the Election as Good vs. Evil. Then His Tractor Burned.,"HENDERSON, Neb. — Jonathan Rempel has never been a loudmouth around town about his politics, but his views are clear when he asks rhetorical questions like, “Have you ever got a job from a poor person?” Or when he says that taxes are a form of extortion. They show up on Facebook, where some of his posts support gun rights and criticize a welfare state.

It was even possible to tell his political outlook from across a field, from the two “Trump 2020” flags that he had hoisted above his combine — until a couple of weeks ago, when a fire destroyed much of his farm equipment.

In Mr. Rempel’s farming community of Henderson and in the countryside that makes up much of the majority Republican state of Nebraska, people say that President Trump represents their deep convictions. And those strongly held beliefs exist in a good versus evil framework in which many see issues like abortion, immigration and what is to them the trade-exploiting, virus-spreading nation of China in the starkest of terms.

Nearly four years ago, in his election night victory speech, Mr. Trump pledged to fight for the “hard-working men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family.”

“The forgotten men and women of our country,” he promised back then, “will be forgotten no longer.”

The president’s supporters in places like rural Nebraska say they feel remembered. To them, these four years have brought a sense of belonging in a country led by someone who sticks up for, and understands, their most cherished beliefs. To the more than 50 percent of Americans who disapprove of the president, Mr. Trump can represent division and dishonesty. In Henderson, and many places like it, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign pitch that he is fighting for the soul of the nation simply doesn’t resonate. People here would view its soul as being in jeopardy if he triumphed.

Thousands of Mr. Trump’s backers showed their devotion to him last week as they solemnly streamed against a chilly autumn wind, some traveling hours, to hear him speak at a campaign event in Omaha, one of a series of whistle-stop rallies across the country where supporters have come together as a single denomination certain of one another’s values.

“Always look where I am,” a man coached a young girl in coveralls, telling her to stay close as they held hands and wove through the Omaha crowd waiting for Mr. Trump. “But these are Trump supporters. You don’t have to worry.”

That sense of Trumpian kinship permeates rural areas like Henderson, population about 1,000, with its two-block downtown, fiery red oak trees, silver grain elevators and artwork on the side of a building off Main Street that reads “some bigger, none better.”

It’s what made the phone call Mr. Rempel received about two weeks ago from fire officials as he and his wife were readying their children for school all the more shocking. His farm equipment was in flames. The combine, a tractor and two semitrailer trucks parked in a corn field south of town apparently had been set on fire.

“I said, ‘No, that’s not possible,’” Mr. Rempel, a fourth-generation farmer, recalled, describing his disbelief that his equipment had been destroyed and his corn harvest put in jeopardy.

Mr. Rempel won’t speculate on a motive for what he believes was arson; the State Fire Marshal has said only that it is investigating the incident.

The charred remains of his farm vehicles sit in a field surrounded for miles by tilled prairie. A blackened Trump flag lies crumpled at the base of a scorched tractor. Mr. Rempel had been so certain they were safe, he left the keys in the ignition.

Though it is unclear how the fire started, the news about it startled a community that believes it shares a common value system. The fact that one vehicle was outfitted with Trump flags has led some residents and some of the more than 1,700 people who commented on Mr. Rempel’s Facebook post about the blaze to declare the fire politically motivated.

It’s a sentiment also expressed by top Republicans in the state. Gov. Pete Ricketts brought up the incident when asked at a news conference about vandalism to pro-Trump signs, calling anyone who would do such a thing “anti-American” and “people who hate our country.” Senator Ben Sasse, whose recent leaked remarks criticizing President Trump were viewed by many Nebraska Republicans as blasphemy, also called the incident “abhorrent.”

For his part, Mr. Rempel refuses to speculate about a motive, but here in Henderson, a certain fear is being whispered: The fire-starters are aligned with antifa, coming from the cities to attack their way of life.

“Whenever you see something on fire that was lit on purpose, or whenever you see a business destroyed, whenever you see somebody making a point through violence, it’s evil,” Mr. Rempel said. “And evil destroys.”

Like most other states, Nebraska is cleaved by an urban-rural divide. Mr. Trump won overwhelming support from the state as a whole. But people in Nebraska’s two major cities tend to vote more liberally than those in rural areas. Mr. Trump won in Omaha’s Second Congressional District in 2016, but Barack Obama won in 2008. The district’s winner picks up a single electoral vote in a state that, unlike most others, splits its votes, which could play a pivotal role in a close election.

Omaha is 117 miles from York County, where Henderson is situated and where Mr. Trump in 2016 won by a landslide. Most people in the county say they are voting for him again — and most plan to go to the polls in person on Tuesday like they always do on Election Day.

“I like what he stands for. He’s against abortion. He’s against evil. He’s against higher taxes,” said Pat Goossen, who owns The Petal Pusher, a flower shop on Henderson’s Main Street. “He shares my values. I don’t want higher taxes. I don’t want our jobs going out.”

Ms. Goossen watched the violence that accompanied some of the protests in the wake of George Floyd’s death on the nightly news. The images made it seem like entire cities were on fire. This summer violent protests broke out in Omaha, where a Black man was killed by a white business owner as people marched against racial injustice. But the protests didn’t reach Henderson.

Though the president has refused to denounce white supremacy, Ms. Goossen, who is white, like most of her neighbors in Henderson, said she couldn’t believe that the president was being tied to violent outbursts at rallies against racial injustice.

“Do you honestly think he caused the burning and the riots? Are you out of your ever-loving mind? He did not,” she said. “He was a victim of this just like the rest of us.”

Ms. Goossen and other supporters of Mr. Trump speak with reverence about the president’s plain talk, how he isn’t a typical pontificating politician, how he, a real estate mogul from New York City, can relate to all strata of society.

The president has been on job sites and spoken to workers “hauling drywall and raising steel,” said Blake Collingsworth, who runs a home-building business in Lincoln.

“You have to be for the little guy,” Mr. Collingsworth said. “He understands that part of society and how important the working person is.”

People like Tim Esch, a rancher from Spalding, remember the pain caused in the 1980s by President Jimmy Carter’s Soviet grain embargo, which sent prices of corn and wheat tumbling. Mr. Trump’s policies on trade with China have been difficult for farmers, too, he said, but will pay off in the long run.

Some of Mr. Trump’s plans haven’t worked out, he said, but his actions show that he has listened to the concerns of farmers.

“This whole China thing, Trump has done nothing but be supportive,” Mr. Esch said. 

Like Mr. Esch, many Republicans in Nebraska think the Democratic Party is using the pandemic as a political tool against the president. Cases of the coronavirus are soaring here; church prayer lists include long lists of names of those suffering. In Henderson, the virus found its way into a nursing home and has affected several families.

But on farms where the nearest home is miles away, worries about the illness seem far-off.

“I’ve got bigger problems than a virus that 99.9 percent of us can overcome without medical intervention,” said Mr. Rempel who, like most other people in the area, doesn’t routinely wear a mask when gathered with others.

Mr. Rempel enjoys the lonely feeling of being on the farm, where he can zone out in the cab of his combine or behind the wheel of his pickup, bouncing down gravel roads.

“I love being in flyover country. I love it. I embrace it,” Mr. Rempel said, walking through his rows of corn and fretting over every bent stalk. “I lived in Omaha. Nobody knew who you were. You could do whatever you wanted. You could go steal a car and run into a post and run away and nobody cares.”

Rural life, he said, offers accountability among people who share a set of values. Being around parents, grandparents, those “who take pride in you,” is grounding. It’s something he thinks is lost in big cities.

The fire has trained Mr. Rempel’s focus on the divisiveness of the country, something he said he was tired of even though he knows his views are starkly different from many people who support Mr. Biden.

“Everybody wants to put people in a box so we can decide right away if we hate you. You’re a Trump supporter! You’re a Biden supporter! We hate you!” he said. “We need to quit that as a country. You are who you are, and I am who I am, and I can love you even if I don’t agree with you.”

In Henderson, word spread quickly among the tightknit set of farmers about Mr. Rempel’s burning equipment. Everyone knew it happened at a crucial time when corn needed to be harvested and hauled to market. The urgency was all the greater for Mr. Rempel whose wife was days away from her due date with the couple’s third child.

 Neighbors and friends from church brought over casseroles and homemade cinnamon rolls. Mr. Rempel’s sister set up a GoFundMe page called “Burned Farmer” where donations have topped $100,000.

And under a silvery sky of a frigid recent dawn, a line of combines and tractors rumbled across the horizon and pulled to a stop in a gravel lot. Some two dozen farmers descended their vehicles and gathered for a prayer before they got to work. They came from neighboring farms and as far away as Colorado to help Mr. Rempel finish his harvest.

“Welcome to my life,” Mr. Rempel said, taking it all in, “where people are good.”"
"Election at Hand, Biden Leads Trump in Four Key States, Poll Shows","[Joe Biden has won the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Read our story]

Joseph R. Biden Jr. holds a clear advantage over President Trump across four of the most important presidential swing states, a new poll shows, bolstered by the support of voters who did not participate in the 2016 election and who now appear to be turning out in large numbers to cast their ballots, mainly for the Democrat.

Mr. Biden, the former vice president, is ahead of Mr. Trump in the Northern battlegrounds of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, as well as in the Sun Belt states of Florida and Arizona, according to a poll of likely voters conducted by The New York Times and Siena College. His strength is most pronounced in Wisconsin, where he has an outright majority of the vote and leads Mr. Trump by 11 points, 52 percent to 41 percent.

Joe Biden is leading Donald Trump in four key battleground states just days before the election.

Based on a New York Times/Siena College poll of likely voters from Oct. 26 to Oct. 31.

Mr. Biden’s performance across the electoral map appears to put him in a stronger position heading into Election Day than any presidential candidate since at least 2008, when in the midst of a global economic crisis Barack Obama captured the White House with 365 Electoral College votes and Mr. Biden at his side.

Mr. Trump’s apparent weakness in many of the country’s largest electoral prizes leaves him with a narrow path to the 270 Electoral College votes required to claim victory, short of a major upset or a systemic error in opinion polling surpassing even the missteps preceding the 2016 election. Should Mr. Biden’s lead hold in three of the four states tested in the survey, it would almost certainly be enough to win, and if he were to carry Florida, he would most likely need to flip just one more large state that Mr. Trump won in 2016 to clinch the presidency.

In the closing days of the campaign, Mr. Biden has a modest advantage in Florida, where he is ahead of Mr. Trump by three points, 47 percent to 44 percent, a lead that is within the margin of error. He leads by six points in both Arizona and Pennsylvania. In no state did Mr. Trump’s support climb higher than 44 percent.

The margin of error is 3.2 percentage points in Wisconsin and Florida; 3 points in Arizona and 2.4 points in Pennsylvania.

Mr. Biden has consistently held the upper hand over Mr. Trump across the electoral map in polling conducted by The Times since late last spring. While that advantage has varied over time, and has differed from state to state, he has at no point slipped behind Mr. Trump in any of the swing states that are likeliest to decide the election.

Mr. Biden’s lead is armored against last-minute developments in the race because of the scale of early and mail-in balloting that has already taken place as the country copes with a resurgence of the coronavirus. More than 90 million Americans had already cast their ballots as of midday Saturday, according to the United States Election Project. In three of the four states The Times surveyed, a majority of respondents said they had already voted, with Pennsylvania the exception.

The president, who narrowly carried all four states against Hillary Clinton, is now running behind his 2016 vote shares in all of them, a grave position for a sitting president just days before the election. He has also trailed consistently in public polls of Michigan, another large state he captured in 2016, which along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania was part of the so-called Blue Wall along the Great Lakes that Democrats had relied on for decades.

Amid that bleak outlook, the president has continued to baselessly cast doubt on the integrity of the election. On Saturday in Pennsylvania, he told supporters that the nation could be waiting for weeks to learn of a winner and that “very bad things” could happen as ballots are counted in the days after the election.

Mr. Trump has continued to hold onto most of the coalition that elected him in the first place, made up chiefly of rural conservatives and white voters who did not attend college. In Florida, the president appears to have improved his position somewhat with Hispanic voters over the last four years, but he has slipped significantly with college-educated whites there. 

More broadly, Mr. Trump is facing an avalanche of opposition nationally from women, people of color, voters in the cities and the suburbs, young people, seniors and, notably, new voters. In all four states, voters who did not participate in 2016, but who have already voted this time or plan to do so, said they support Mr. Biden by wide margins. That group includes both infrequent voters and young people who were not yet eligible to vote four years ago.

In Wisconsin, voters who did not cast a ballot in 2016 favor Mr. Biden by 19 points. They have a similarly lopsided preference in Florida, where Mr. Biden leads by 17 points. His advantage with people who did not vote in 2016 is 12 points in Pennsylvania and 7 points in Arizona.

Many of the those who said they did not vote in 2016 said they had already voted this year. In Florida and Arizona, more than two thirds of nonvoters in 2016 who were identified as likely voters this year said that they had already cast a ballot. That figure was 56 percent in Wisconsin and 36 percent in Pennsylvania.

Melissa Dibble, 47, of Boynton Beach, Fla., is one of those newly active voters. A registered independent, Ms. Dibble said she did not vote in 2016 because she did not believe Mrs. Clinton was “the right president for our country” and found Mr. Trump “laughable.” She said on Friday that she planned to vote for Mr. Biden that afternoon.

“I know how important it is to vote, but I couldn’t wrap my head around the options at that point,” Ms. Dibble said of the 2016 election. She said she was voting for Mr. Biden because “I really want change. I can’t believe that we have a president who is, at night, in bed tweeting nonsense and just talks poorly about people.”

Vince Kowalewski, 73, of Muhlenberg Township, Pa., said he had never voted in his life but was intent on voting against Mr. Trump, whom he called “the worst president we’ve ever had.”

“I have to go in there and vote against him,” Mr. Kowalewski said.

But Mr. Kowalewski said he also appreciated Mr. Biden’s health care policies, including the Affordable Care Act, which he credited with helping his daughter receive lifesaving cancer treatment.

The numbers on new voters represent a setback for the president, whose advisers have long contended he would outperform his polling numbers because of the support he would receive from infrequent or inconsistent voters. Republicans continue to hope that the Trump campaign’s voter-registration and turnout machinery might give him a crucial edge over Mr. Biden in a few key battlegrounds, or at least lift the party’s down-ballot candidates enough to maintain control of the Senate.

Based on the poll, however, it seems that Mr. Biden rather than Mr. Trump could be the beneficiary of record-busting turnout.

Still, the enthusiasm Mr. Trump stirs in his supporters remains a factor in the election. Linda Shoop, of Halifax, Pa., said she did not vote in 2016 but not for lack of a preference: A Trump supporter, Ms. Shoop has arthritis and struggles to get around. But with absentee voting more widely accessible this year, she said she would vote by mail for the president.

“He has common sense,” Ms. Shoop said, describing him as more forthright than a longtime politician like Mr. Biden. The president, she said, “doesn’t lie to you. If he says he’s going to do something, he goes and he does it.”

If the president is defeated, the most obvious explanation may be his weakness with women. Mr. Biden led Mr. Trump by double digits among female voters in each of the four states, and in some states the advantage was so significant that it offset Mr. Trump’s strength among men.

In Arizona, for example, the president had an eight-point advantage with men but Mr. Biden was the overwhelming favorite of women, winning 56 percent of them compared with Mr. Trump’s 38 percent.

The other group that is propelling Mr. Biden is college-educated white voters, a traditionally Republican bloc that has fled the Trump-era party. The former vice president is leading by double digits among white voters with college degrees in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Arizona and beating him, 48 percent to 45 percent, with that constituency in Florida.

In Maricopa County, Ariz., home to Phoenix and its suburbs, Mr. Biden is winning 48 percent of the vote compared with 42 percent for Mr. Trump, according to the survey. In 2016, Mr. Trump won the county by three points.Mr. Biden is also poised to become the first Democrat in 20 years to carry older adults, the voters who are most at risk with the coronavirus. In Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, the former vice president is leading by double digits with older voters. And in Florida and Arizona, retiree havens with wealthier and more tax-phobic seniors, Mr. Trump is effectively tied with Mr. Biden among older voters despite having won with them convincingly in both states in 2016.The president remains in contention in Florida on the strength of his support from working-class whites and his gains among Hispanic voters. He’s running more competitively with Florida Latinos than he did in 2016, and 9 percent of them remain undecided.

Hispanic men in Florida, in particular, are more willing to support Mr. Trump. The poll found the two candidates splitting this group almost evenly, with Mr. Biden ahead by just one point. But the president is facing an even larger gender gap in the Hispanic community than he is over all: Latinas favor Mr. Biden by 39 points.

Farah Robles Figueroa, of West Palm Beach, said she had already cast her vote for Mr. Biden in the largest of the traditional swing states. Ms. Robles, 32, is a registered Democrat but said she had sat out the 2016 election because she believed Mrs. Clinton was certain to win. She said she admired Mr. Biden’s personal character and approved of his recommendations for fighting the coronavirus, like mandating the use of masks.

But Ms. Robles also said she believed there was a larger issue at stake in the vote.

“I don’t want to be dramatic,” she said, “but I’m voting this year because it feels like democracy is at stake.”

"Preaching or Avoiding Politics, Conservative Churches Walk a Delicate Line","The second weekend in October was “citizenship weekend” at Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano, Texas.

“Up and down the ballot, there are two very different visions for our nation, and every one of us need to vote biblical principles,” the Rev. Jack Graham, one of President Trump’s evangelical advisers, told the congregation. The 45,000-member church has a committee urging members to be “actively involved in our government,” including by running for office. At one point, Mr. Graham told the congregation, 23 members of the church held some kind of elected office. Mr. Graham invited four to the stage that Sunday, all Republicans.

But Mr. Graham does not see it as his job to tell members how to fill out their ballots. “You preach on the issues; you don’t insult people by telling them how to vote,” Mr. Graham said in an interview. “People will figure out how to vote if you guide them from Scripture.” Last Sunday, he preached on the importance of religious liberty.

Decades after the rise of the Christian Right as a political influence, conservative evangelicals have a reputation for political activism. That reputation has only intensified in the Trump era. White evangelicals voted for Mr. Trump overwhelmingly in 2016, and have remained his most dependable supporters. The president himself, who is not a frequent churchgoer, has indicated that he assumes conservative evangelical pastors would be eager to speak even more directly — perhaps to endorse him — if freed by tax law to do so.

In 2017, he signed an executive order intended to loosen enforcement of the Johnson Amendment, the provision that forbids pastors at tax-exempt churches from endorsing or opposing candidates from the pulpit. “We are giving churches their voices back,” he said at a Rose Garden signing ceremony, framing the change as a gift to religious conservatives.

But tuning into conservative evangelical sermons across the country in the weeks leading up to a hotly contested election reveals a complex relationship between the pulpit and politics. Some pastors grappled directly with the question of a Christian’s political obligations. Others edged close to an endorsement. But many barely hinted at political themes, perhaps gesturing broadly to “unity” or “justice.”

Compared with other Christian traditions, white conservative Protestant churches are notably unenthusiastic about engaging directly in some kinds of traditional political activities. If tax law changed, 45 percent of self-described liberal congregations would endorse specific candidates, compared with 11 percent of self-described conservative congregations, according to a forthcoming paper analyzing data from the National Congregations Study, an ongoing nationally representative survey of about 1,200 leaders of religious congregations. Black churches, whose members are often theologically conservative and vote Democratic, are the most politically engaged.

But surveys about voter registration or lobbying — activities that liberal churches are likelier to engage in — do not capture the full portrait of churches’ political messaging. “There’s a lot more political signaling going on than we pick up with these explicit collective actions,” said Mark Chaves, director of the National Congregations Study and a professor at Duke University.

Surveys do not capture, for example, an American flag displayed at the front of the church, prayers offered for police officers but not protesters (or vice versa), or passing references to “life” or “freedom” in a sermon.

As a pastor in the Christian Reformed Church, Keith Mannes would have said for most of his career that he did not preach about politics. He calls himself “a pretty conservative guy,” and he occasionally addressed abortion or homosexuality in his sermons, but he saw those topics as biblical, not political.

But in 2015 something changed when Mr. Mannes watched Donald J. Trump slowly descend a gleaming escalator at Trump Tower to launch his presidential bid. The gaudiness struck him as grotesque; the biblical term “mammon” came to mind.

After Mr. Trump became president, Mr. Mannes increasingly felt called to speak directly about what he saw as an ungodly alliance between white conservative Christians and Mr. Trump. But for several years, he tried to stay quiet. “It’s just in our bones that we don’t make trouble about politics,” Mr. Mannes said. “We don’t talk about that stuff from the pulpit.”

He delivered his last sermon at East Saugatuck Christian Reformed Church in Holland, Mich., on Oct. 11. After years of trying to “avoid politics” in the pulpit to keep peace in the congregation, he approached church leadership to suggest it was time to part ways. “You realize you’re extending all this energy just to make sure people don’t get upset,” he said. “I wanted to be able to speak openly in the world about what I believe.”

Pastors whose own political beliefs are in line with their congregations’ tend to feel more empowered to speak. In Apex, N.C., another evangelical pastor had watched in a very different mood as Mr. Trump descended the escalator at Trump Tower. “When he came down the escalator, I didn’t know much about him but I turned to my wife and said, ‘Honey, that guy’s going to win,’” Rodney Finch recalled. Mr. Finch, the Black pastor of a large multiracial church he founded in 1995, said he had not been strongly engaged in politics before, but the moment was electrifying.

This election cycle, Mr. Finch is all in. On Oct. 4, he preached a Sunday sermon on voting. “The Bible is a voter’s guide,” he told the congregation. Without explicitly telling members how to fill out their ballots, he ticked off God’s priorities, in his view: abortion, support for Israel, religious freedom. He has also signed his church up with My Faith Votes, an organization that aims to boost turnout among conservative Christian voters by distributing voter guides and video content to churches for use in weekend services.

Mr. Finch is not alone in his awakening. Just 1 percent of Protestant pastors say they have endorsed a candidate from the pulpit this year, according to a survey conducted this fall by LifeWay Research, which is affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention. That number is unchanged since 2016. But 32 percent of Protestant pastors said they have endorsed a political candidate away from the pulpit, ostensibly outside of their role as a pastor. That is a 10 percentage point increase since the last presidential election cycle. Pastors who say they are voting for Mr. Trump are more likely to say they have made an endorsement.

Still, in many white conservative churches, “there’s a fear of being labeled ‘political,’” said Kaitlyn Schiess, the author of “The Liturgy of Politics: Spiritual Formation for the Sake of Our Neighbor,” a book urging evangelicals to engage more intentionally with politics. “As Christians, we’re supposed to be above that.”

An analysis by the Pew Research Center of 50,000 sermons streamed online last year found that 4 percent of Christian sermons even mentioned abortion, and those that did rarely focused entirely on the topic. Smaller congregations were more likely than larger ones to hear discussion of abortion in sermons.

At many evangelical churches, there have been almost no hints from the pulpit in recent weeks of the divisive election on the way.

“My job is to articulate to the members of our congregation a traditional, orthodox Christian worldview,” said Tim Breen, pastor of First Reformed Church in Orange City, Iowa, a congregation he described as “center right.” “I don’t feel a call to recommend who to vote for or even necessarily how to vote.” Most people in his congregation, he said, would not be able to guess who he is voting for.

At Trinity Presbyterian Church in Charlottesville, Va., churchgoers can participate in a class titled “The Bible, the Church and Politics” on Wednesday evenings leading up to the election. One session listed biblical priorities including a safety net for the poor, fair wages, “creation stewardship,” personal responsibility and “protection of the unborn.”

“The church is trying to balance, ‘How do we engage faithfully with social issues, but how do we not get swallowed up?’” said Trinity pastor Walter Kim, the president of the National Association of Evangelicals, referring to the American church in general. Mr. Kim describes his university-town congregation as “conservative theologically, but mixed politically.” “There’s a bit of a tension,” he said. “Some people come to church with a deep desire to understand their world. Some come to church to find a reprieve from the world.”

Mr. Kim tries to navigate that tension by focusing on larger moral principles rather than partisan politics from the pulpit. On Oct. 25, he preached from the New Testament book of James, a sermon that focused on humility, repentance and the ultimate folly of many disputes. He did not mention Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Trump or the upcoming election. “From the perspective of eternity,” he told his congregation, “we’re going to regret a lot of our fights.”"
Dishonesty Has Defined the Trump Presidency. The Consequences Could Be Lasting.,"WASHINGTON — Born amid made-up crowd size claims and “alternative facts,” the Trump presidency has been a factory of falsehood from the start, churning out distortions, conspiracy theories and brazen lies at an assembly-line pace that has challenged fact-checkers and defied historical analogy.

But now, with the election two days away, the consequences of four years of fabulism are coming into focus as President Trump argues that the vote itself is inherently “rigged,” tearing at the credibility of the system. Should the contest go into extra innings through legal challenges after Tuesday, it may leave a public with little faith in the outcome — and in its own democracy.

During his final weekend of campaign rallies, Mr. Trump continued to sow doubt about the validity of the election, making clear that he would deem any outcome other than victory for him to be corrupt. At a rally in Philadelphia, which has a sizable nonwhite population and a Democratic-led government, he asserted that the city would falsify the results. “Are they going to mysteriously find more ballots” after polls close, he asked. “Strange things have been known to happen, especially in Philadelphia.”

The nightmarish scenario of widespread doubt and denial of the legitimacy of the election would cap a period in American history when truth itself has seemed at stake under a president who has strayed so far from the normal bounds that he creates what allies call his own reality. Even if the election ends with a clear victory or defeat for Mr. Trump, scholars and players alike say the very concept of public trust in an established set of facts necessary for the operation of a democratic society has eroded during his tenure with potentially long-term ramifications.

“You can mitigate the damage, but you can’t bring it back to 100 percent the way it was before,” said Lee McIntyre, the author of “Post-Truth” and a philosopher at Boston University. “And I think that’s going to be Trump’s legacy. I think there’s going to be lingering damage to the processes by which we vet truths for decades. People are going to be saying, ‘Oh, that’s fake news.’ The confusion between skepticism and denialism, the idea that if you don’t want to believe something, you don’t have to believe it — that’s really damaging, and that’s going to last.”

Indeed, the very idea of truth is increasingly a fungible commodity in a political environment that seems to reward the loudest voices, not the most honest. In a recent poll for Newsweek, 54 percent of Americans agreed that lying has become more acceptable in American politics in recent years, while only 13 percent said it was less acceptable and the rest said it was about the same or did not have a view.

Nancy L. Rosenblum, a Harvard University professor emerita who wrote “A Lot of People Are Saying” with Russell Muirhead, said that may not change even if Mr. Trump leaves office after one term because he proved the advantages of truth-bending politics and helped build up an information infrastructure where reality is like an à la carte menu from which Americans can pick their favorite variant.

“Conspiracy charges and a certain amount of lying have proved to be good weapons in political fighting where you have deep, deep divisions, and there’s no reason to think other parties won’t take it up under desperate circumstances,” she said. “So we can expect it to go on but without the same effect.”

The lasting impact may be most evident in terms of the coronavirus pandemic that has already killed more than 230,000 in the United States. Even as the outbreak surges to new peaks, Mr. Trump has been falsely insisting that it is “rounding the corner” to an end, telling Americans not to worry rather than urging them to take precautions.

The disconnect has tangible consequences. Republicans who support Mr. Trump are more likely to dismiss the threat of the virus in surveys and less likely to wear masks or maintain social distance. A poll last week by Axios and Ipsos found only half of Americans could correctly respond to six factual questions about the virus, indicating how far misinformation linked to reckless behavior has pervaded the public.

Scientists have concluded that 130,000 lives could be saved in the United States in the coming months if there was universal mask wearing. But Mr. Trump mocks facial coverings and disparages medical experts, undercutting their credibility with the public, most notably Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the federal government’s chief epidemiologist who now has to have a security detail after vilification by the president and his allies. With views of the virus increasingly falling along party lines, many Americans express distrust over a possible new vaccine, which could lead to widespread resistance to inoculation.

Beyond the health crisis, Mr. Trump’s successor, whether next year or in five years, could face a broader crisis in faith, challenged to re-establish credibility with overseas allies and adversaries, while presiding over a country where truth has been broken down into tribes and much of the public has been conditioned to distrust institutions of all sorts.

Mr. Trump has spent four years telling Americans not to trust anyone other than him, whether it be public health experts, scientists, journalists, judges, career government officials, investigators, generals, intelligence agencies, election officials and even mail carriers. “Just remember,” he told a crowd one summer, “what you are seeing and what you are reading is not what’s happening.”

Trust, once lost, is hard to restore. “We know a lot about the delegitimation of democratic institutions over the last two centuries,” Ms. Rosenblum said. “But we know nothing about how you relegitimate institutions that have lost their main value and authority for an awful lot of people. That’s the real question.”

Dishonesty has been a defining hallmark of the Trump presidency. The sheer volume of untruths, both petty and profound, has been cataloged and quantified time and again, the subject of a shelf full of books and endless hand-wringing over the “post-truth” world.

This is a president who casually accused a television anchor of murder, who spread the claim that Osama bin Laden is not actually dead and that President Barack Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had the Navy’s SEAL Team 6 killed, who literally took a Sharpie to a map to create his own fake weather forecast and reprimanded meteorologists who dared to correct him.

Campaign rallies have been chock-full of specious claims and fan-fiction narratives. He has renewed his assertion that Mexico is paying for his border wall, declared that he won the women’s vote in 2016 and claimed credit for restoring order in Minneapolis, none of which is true. The New York Times tabulated 131 false or misleading statements in a single rally in Janesville, Wis. The Washington Post counted more than 22,000 false or misleading statements over nearly four years, including 189 on a single day in August.

When challenged, Mr. Trump simply brushes it off. After a reporter in August asked “do you regret at all, all the lying you’ve done to the American people,” the president sought to clarify the question and then once he understood it called on another reporter without replying.

It is often left to aides to try to re-engineer what he says to fit the facts or dismiss facts altogether, often simply turning the tables by complaining about biased nit-picking by the news media.

“The American people never have to wonder how the president feels about a particular topic, which is one of the many reasons they chose to elect him over the same, old, recycled politicians who just use the poll-tested talking points,” said Judd Deere, a White House spokesman. He asserted that “the media routinely manipulates the president’s words and takes him totally out of context, but that will never stop him from unapologetically calling out their biased reporting, raising important questions or suggesting common sense ideas to solve problems.”

There is, of course, a long history of presidential prevarication. Franklin D. Roosevelt was hardly straight with the American public before World War II, nor was Lyndon B. Johnson during the Vietnam War. Richard M. Nixon lied about a burglary and was forced to resign. Ronald Reagan conflated movie memories with real life and regularly spun out favorite stories with no apparent basis in fact. Bill Clinton was impeached for lying under oath about his affair with a White House intern. George W. Bush went to war based on false intelligence even if he did not actually know it to be false.

Mr. Biden, now the Democratic presidential nominee, has had his own misadventures with misstatements, caught on several occasions during his career in politics puffing up his own record. His first presidential campaign blew up in 1987 after he lifted lines from another politician’s speech without credit, overstated his academic accomplishments and was revealed to have been accused of plagiarism in law school. Mr. Biden, unlike Mr. Trump, admitted the errors, while calling them innocent mistakes. Still, he has been prone to exaggeration since then as well.

But as with so many things, Mr. Trump takes matters to his own Trumpian extremes. Many of his falsehoods may be minor, but others would have created days of headlines under any other president. And when other presidents got caught, there were corrections or consequences or at least an effort to avoid repeating the misstatements. Not so with Mr. Trump.

The American system has never figured out quite how to respond to a president who gives the conspiracy theorists of QAnon a hearing at the White House. For four years, a cottage industry of debate has raged about postmodernist theory and whether Trumpian truth is simply the most extreme manifestation of an American tendency to write our own reality, that there is no universal truth, only individual experiences with it.

Publishers have pumped out books with titles like “The Death of Truth,” “Truth Decay” and “Donald Trump and His Assault on Truth,” while newsrooms wrestled with the question of when to use the word “lie” and social media giants began applying warning labels to the president of the United States lest Americans actually believe what he says.

Fact-checks could never keep up with the avalanche of assertions and many people simply chose camps. Only 40 percent of Americans see Mr. Trump as honest and trustworthy, according to Gallup, compared with 52 percent who find Mr. Biden to be so. (In their re-election years, 45 percent judged Mr. Clinton honest, 55 percent considered Mr. Bush so and 60 percent believed Mr. Obama was.)

“We don’t even blink at this stuff anymore. Nobody blinks,” said Amanda Carpenter, a former adviser to Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, who wrote the book “Gaslighting America” about Mr. Trump’s deceptions. “We have to not pay attention to it just in order to survive. You can’t sustain the outrage. At the same time then, people will push this further and further and there are real world effects.”

Many Republicans who once called Mr. Trump on his falsehoods gave up and some even jumped on his train. Mr. Cruz, whose father Mr. Trump bizarrely linked to John F. Kennedy’s assassination during the 2016 campaign, called the future president a “pathological liar” at the time. “He doesn’t know the difference between truth and lies,” Mr. Cruz said then. “He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth.” But Mr. Cruz became one of Mr. Trump’s staunchest defenders during his impeachment trial.

Mr. Trump’s disregard for facts long predates the White House, of course. His penchant for “truthful hyperbole,” as he put it in his first memoir, meant faking work at a construction site to fool business partners or advertising Trump Tower as a 68-floor building when it actually has 58. He propelled himself into politics with the lie that Mr. Obama may have been born in Africa.

Where Mr. Trump is oddly most honest, it often seems, is in explaining his own motivations. He openly admits self-interested calculations that other presidents would at the very least shroud behind high-minded, gauzy justifications. He told a crowd in Erie, Pa., recently that he would not have bothered to visit if he were doing better in the polls. He leaves no doubt that he wants his attorney general to investigate his opponents in order to help his campaign and that he wanted his nominee confirmed to the Supreme Court before the election to gain another vote in case the justices decide the result.

Many supporters acknowledge that some of what he says is not literally true but consider him more honest than typical politicians because he seems to say what he actually thinks, rather than sticking to safe, poll-tested, milquetoast talking points. His bracing, hold-nothing-back performances strike admirers as more real and, yes, more authentic, a word that is gold to the political class.

“How can it be that someone we all know is such a liar is also seen as authentic?” asked David Greenberg, a professor at Rutgers University and author of “Republic of Spin,” a history of White House image-making that preceded Mr. Trump. “It’s because authenticity isn’t exactly the same thing as truthfulness. It’s also about a truthful presentation of yourself and what yourself is — and it may be that his authentic self is a liar.”"
"The 2020 election’s unnerving end: vandalism, acts of intimidation and riot prep.","Presidential elections always provoke anxiety, but this year’s campaign is closing on an especially unnerving note, with reports of pre-election vandalism, the boarding-up of stores in anticipation of rioting and the specter of voter intimidation.

On Monday morning, officials arriving at the Democratic headquarters in Harris County, Tex., found the locks on the front door sealed with glue, and slogans and blobs of red paint smeared on windows.

In the suburbs of Pittsburgh, aides to Representative Conor Lamb, a Democrat, arrived at their storefront office to a similar scene: It was defaced with a red hammer-and-sickle sign and the words, “Don’t vote! Fight for revolution.”

Police said they were investigating both incidents but had not yet identified any perpetrators.

Throughout the country, business owners and government officials — from the managers of Saks Fifth Avenue to the president’s staff — were bracing for potential acts of vandalism or violence based on the outcome, or lack of an outcome.

On Monday, the F.B.I. confirmed that its San Antonio office was investigating an incident in which a caravan of Trump supporters surrounded a Biden campaign bus on Friday — an act of intimidation that President Trump praised on Twitter.

In New York City, the windows of Saks Fifth Avenue, which have wowed tourists for decades, were boarded up on Monday morning. SoHo, where trendy shoppers once flocked to glittering stores, echoed with the sound of hammers. On the sidewalk outside the Disney Store in Times Square, workers attached plywood to the storefront.

The sea of plywood stretched into more modest commercial districts in the Bronx and Brooklyn, and even to Washington, where in recent days the ominous precaution has been evident all across downtown, fanning out several blocks from the White House, spreading around Capitol Hill, transforming the nightlife corridors of 14th Street and Adams-Morgan and reaching up into the suburbs.

On Sunday, students at George Washington University received an email headlined “We Suggest Preparing for the Election Day Period as you Would for a Hurricane or a Snowstorm.” Reporters at The Wall Street Journal’s Washington bureau were issued gas masks and orange bike helmets marked “press.” It appeared that nearly every CVS, Walgreens and 7-Eleven within at least a mile or so of downtown was being heavily fortified.

The preparations reflected a broader national anxiety surrounding the contest between Mr. Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr., and the growing fears that no matter who wins, the aftermath of the election could include violence.

The weekend saw tensions flare up. In North Carolina on Saturday, the police used a chemical spray to disperse a get-out-the-vote rally. On Sunday, cars and trucks with Trump flags halted traffic on the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey and jammed the Mario M. Cuomo Bridge in New York’s northern suburbs, and a pro-Trump convoy in Virginia ended in a tense shouting match with protesters as it approached a statue of Robert E. Lee in Richmond.

States are already on alert. On Monday, Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts ordered 1,000 members of the National Guard to be on standby. In Oregon, which has seen months of sporadic unrest, Gov. Kate Brown ordered the state National Guard to remain on standby in case violent protests erupt.

“We know that there are some people who might use peaceful election night protests to promote violence and property destruction,” Ms. Brown said Monday. “That behavior is not acceptable.”"
These Candidates Made History in the 2020 Election,"The 2020 election saw a diverse set of candidates in races across the country, even though the presidential contest was between two septuagenarian white men. Here are some of the winners who made history.

Kamala Harris is the first woman — as well as the first Black woman and the first Indian-American woman — to be elected vice president.

[Read our profile of Kamala Harris, the first woman elected U.S. vice president.]

Ritchie Torres and Mondaire Jones, both Democrats, swept aside their Republican opponents and became the first openly gay Black men to be elected to Congress. Mr. Torres, the first openly gay Afro-Latino elected to Congress, will replace Representative José Serrano in New York’s 15th Congressional District. Mr. Jones will fill the seat in New York’s 17th Congressional District that is being vacated by Representative Nita Lowey. 

Cori Bush, a progressive who toppled a member of the Democratic Party establishment during her primary, cruised to victory over Anthony Rogers, a Republican, and became the first Black woman elected to represent Missouri in Congress. “To the Black women, the Black girls, the nurses, the essential workers, the single mothers — this is our moment,” Ms. Bush said in her victory speech.

Marilyn Strickland, the former Mayor of Tacoma, Wash., who defeated another Democrat in her congressional race, Michelle Steel, a California Republican who narrowly ousted a Democratic incumbent in hers, and Young Kim, a California Republican who lost her race two years ago but defeated a Democratic incumbent this time around, are the first Korean-American women ever elected to Congress. Ms. Strickland will also be the first Black woman to represent Washington State at the federal level.

Election night victories by Representative Deb Haaland, Democrat of New Mexico, in the state’s First District, Yvette Herrell, a Republican, in its Second District, and Teresa Leger Fernandez, a Democrat, in its Third District, mean that New Mexico’s entire House delegation will be made up of women of color. Ms. Herrell is also the first Republican Native American woman elected to Congress.

Cynthia Lummis, a Republican former congresswoman, will become the first woman to serve in the Senate from Wyoming. She cruised to victory in the race to succeed Senator Michael B. Enzi, who is retiring.

Sarah McBride, elected to the Delaware Senate, will become the first openly transgender state senator and the highest-ranking transgender official in the U.S. Her victory came just three years after Danica Roem of Virginia became the first openly trans person elected to the lower chamber of a state legislature.

“I am hopeful that there’s a young person desperately in need of that message, who, just before going to bed, looked online and saw this result,” Ms. McBride said. “For that person, they know that change is possible and things can get better.”"
"With no winner in the presidential race, Trump falsely asserts that he has prevailed.","With no winner in the 2020 race and votes still being counted in several battleground states, President Trump entered the East Room of the White House at 2:21 a.m. on Wednesday and asserted without evidence that the election was being taken from him by “a very sad group of people.”

“This is a fraud on the American public,” he told a crowd of supporters, in a reckless and unsubstantiated string of remarks about the democratic process. “This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win the election.”

The president said he wanted to stop the counting of votes and put the outcome of the election in the hands of the Supreme Court. “We want all voting to stop,” he said.

“We will win this,” he continued. “As far as I am concerned we already have won it.” He had not, in fact, won the battleground states he claimed as victories, like North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Many states were still counting votes and had not reported any vote totals.

His remarks were an escalation of his monthslong effort to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the race and previewed what is expected to become a protracted legal battle. Before Mr. Trump’s false claims, his campaign was already fund-raising off the uncertain outcome. A 12:03 a.m. plea asked for money to help “protect the integrity of this Election.”

They also stood in contrast to remarks made earlier in the evening by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who urged his supporters to have patience until all the votes were counted.

“It’s not my place or Donald Trump’s place to declare the winner of this election,” Mr. Biden tweeted. “It’s the voters’ place.”

An early call of Arizona for Mr. Biden by Fox News was another check on any legitimate claim that Mr. Trump had won, or was even the likely victor in the race. And that call appeared to have enraged him. He told supporters that he had been watching Arnon Mishkin, the leader of the network’s decision desk, who appeared just after 12:30 a.m. and insisted Mr. Trump could not win the state.

“We have a lot of life in that and somebody declared that it was a victory,” Mr. Trump said. “Maybe it will be. I mean that is possible. But certainly there were a lot of votes out there that we could get because we’re now just coming into what they call Trump territory.”

Less than an hour after he left the stage, The Associated Press called Arizona for Mr. Biden."
"In hopes of keeping his hold on the G.O.P., Trump plans a leadership PAC.","President Trump is planning to form a so-called leadership political action committee, a federal fund-raising vehicle that will potentially let him retain his hold on the Republican Party even when he is out of office, officials said Monday.

The announcement is expected as soon as this week, just days after the major news networks and newspapers, as well as The Associated Press, called the 2020 election for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

The PAC would almost certainly be a vehicle by which Mr. Trump could retain influence in a party that has been remade largely in his image over the past four years.

Such committees can accept donations of up to $5,000 per donor per year — far less than the limits for the committees formed by Mr. Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee.

But a leadership PAC could accept donations from an unlimited number of people and accept donations from other political action committees. And it could spend an unlimited amount in so-called independent expenditures to benefit other candidates, as well as fund travel, polling and consultants."
"99.7 million Americans have already voted, nearly three-quarters of 2016’s total.","Whatever the outcome, the 2020 election is already one for the history books, with an astonishing 99.7 million ballots already submitted through in-person early voting and by mail — nearly three-quarters of the number of votes cast in the entire 2016 election.

As early voting ended Monday night, 35.7 million people had voted in person and 63.9 million had cast ballots by mail, according to the U.S. Elections Project, a nonpartisan website run by Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor who tracks county-level data.

Those numbers represent a tectonic shift away from one-day voting, the staple of the American electoral system for centuries.

And they make it likely that the total turnout for 2020 will break the record set in 2016, when nearly 139 million people voted.

They also create fresh uncertainty for two presidential campaigns facing the prospect of motivating a smaller, more-volatile reservoir of available voters to tap on Election Day itself.

Democrats, buoyed by polls showing Joseph R. Biden Jr. with small but durable leads in battleground states, have focused on turning out Black and Latino voters, who typically prefer voting in person, to offset an expected Election-Day surge by Trump supporters.

Texas and Hawaii have already surpassed their total 2016 voter turnout, and the battleground states of North Carolina, Georgia and Florida have topped 90 percent of their 2016 turnout.

In the 20 states that report the party registration of early voters, the elections project found that 45 percent of those who have voted early are registered Democrats, 31 percent are Republicans and 24 percent list no party affiliation.

Officials with both the Biden and Trump campaigns have viewed the split between early voters and Election-Day voters as highly partisan, with Democrats in most states making up a clear majority of early voters and Republicans, motivated by President Trump’s effort to undermine the legitimacy of mail-in balloting, waiting to show up to the polls.

The Trump campaign continues to wage an all-fronts fight in court to limit the time states have to count ballots, while Democrats, citing the challenges posed by the pandemic, have pressed for more time and for looser scrutiny of ballot signatures that could invalidate some votes.

On Sunday, Mr. Trump falsely suggested that states like Pennsylvania, which can take days to count mail-in ballots, needed to complete vote counts on Election Day. He vowed to mount a legal challenge to the Pennsylvania vote.

“We’re going to go in the night of, as soon as that election’s over, we’re going in with our lawyers,” the president said.

"In San Francisco, Closed Public Schools, Open Private Schools","This is the Coronavirus Schools Briefing, a guide to the seismic changes in U.S. education that are taking place during the pandemic. Sign up here to get this newsletter in your inbox. 

In San Francisco, restaurants, movie theaters and museums are open at reduced capacity. The share of coronavirus tests that come back positive in the city has stayed low since a surge over the summer.

But as some of San Francisco’s private and parochial schools have begun to reopen their doors, its public school district has not set a timeline for resuming in-person instruction, except to say that it is not likely in this calendar year.

That has made San Francisco the latest flash point over school reopening. This politically progressive city is also California’s most unequal area, and its sharp debate about how best to safely educate low-income and minority students during the pandemic resonates across the country.

Last month, in the wake of months of protests for racial equity across the country, San Francisco’s district administrators recommended a significant move. They told the principals of roughly one-third of the district’s 125 public schools that their communities should start brainstorming new names for their schools, because the current names had historical associations with slavery, genocide, colonization or other injustices.

The list included schools named for George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, as enslavers; Abraham Lincoln, for his treatment of Native Americans; and even the state’s senior U.S. senator, Dianne Feinstein, over reports that, as mayor in 1984, she replaced a vandalized Confederate flag outside City Hall.

The news prompted a scathing statement from Mayor London Breed, who called it “offensive” — to parents and to students — for the district to be focusing on renaming schools when it had no definitive plan for reopening them.

“I had had it, honestly,” said Breed, in an interview with our colleague Kate Taylor on Oct. 22. “From my perspective, they weren’t providing clarity about one of the most important things to kids and families in this city.”

San Francisco is 48 percent white, but as of 2019, the city’s public schools were 15 percent white. Forty percent of students were Asian, 27 percent Latino and 7 percent Black.

“The achievement gap is growing, and there are kids who live in poverty who are falling behind,” Breed said.

The president of the Board of Education suggested that parents of color, whose families have been hardest hit by the pandemic in both the Bay Area and across the country, were less eager to send students back to school. And it is true that child care centers for low-income families are operating below capacity.

“I would imagine that families are choosing not to go because they’re afraid,” said the board president, Mark Sanchez. He has argued that calls for reopening are largely coming from a small group of well-off parents.

Too simplistic, says Dheyanira Calahorrano, a community health worker who has an 11-year-old son in public school.

Her neighbors in the Mission District, a historically Latino neighborhood, are afraid of catching the virus, but many parents still want their children back in classrooms, she said. Some mothers worry that their children are not making academic progress and are struggling with behavioral problems. Others have decided not to go back to work, to be able to help their children with distance learning.

“We are suffering an educational crisis,” Calahorrano said.

Although children are at lower risk if they are infected, teachers tend to be older and at higher risk. (Schools, other than an earlier outbreak in Israel, do not seem to be stoking community transmission.)

In San Francisco, the teachers’ union has said conditions are not yet safe for classroom instruction. Across the bay, in Oakland, the unions have said that their members do not want to return until there is essentially no local transmission.

One hurdle is setting up a program of surveillance testing for school staff. State guidelines suggest testing all teachers every two months. Sanchez, the San Francisco school official, wants teachers tested every week.

“That’s what the private schools are doing,” Sanchez said. “Why aren’t our teachers worth that?”

In Oakland, UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital Oakland has seen an increase in mental health challenges for children.

Updated Dec. 18, 2020

The latest on how the pandemic is reshaping education.

Out of all children aged 10 to 18 treated at the hospital’s emergency department, 16 percent screened positive for suicidal thoughts in September, an increase from 6 percent in March, according to Jacqueline Grupp-Phelan, the chief of pediatric emergency medicine at the University of California San Francisco.

“We really, absolutely, have to consider that the cure might be worse than the disease,” Grupp-Phelan said.

Experts have expressed concern that if San Francisco and other Bay Area districts wait much longer to open schools, infections will rise significantly again, making it more difficult to reassure people that schools are safe.

Matt Aldrich, the executive medical director of critical care at U.C.S.F. and a father of two children in the district, said he was disappointed that there had been little discussion among members of the Board of Education about the largely reassuring evidence so far from school reopenings across the country and abroad.

“If we say that the only way that we can return to school is to have some plan that seemingly guarantees that there will be zero cases at all, that just strikes me as setting us up to never return this year,” he said.

The University of Wisconsin canceled this weekend’s planned football game against Purdue University after at least 27 positive cases within the program, including Coach Paul Chryst. Wisconsin had previously canceled its game against the University of Nebraska.

After parties over Halloween weekend, 46 students are on interim suspension from Skidmore College.

Faculty, graduate students and community members at the University of Florida protested the school’s plan to resume pre-pandemic levels of in-person classes in the spring.

In Baltimore, 44 public schools will reopen for small groups of students by mid-November. Students experiencing housing insecurity, those with disabilities and those showing up to fewer than 20 percent of online lessons will come back first.

In Arlington, Va., most public school students will not return to classrooms until at least the end of the calendar year, the superintendent said.

Canada is prioritizing keeping schools open, even as cases surge and businesses close. Students are learning in-person in all 13 provinces and territories, although some have a hybrid or remote-learning option.

“Shout out to all the parents making breakfast, turning on PBS Kids, singing songs, & keeping tiny people balanced and protected in the midst of all of this,” Joshua DuBois, a parent and former member of the Obama administration, wrote on Twitter.

We’re just nodding along to that, but wanted to also offer resources. If you’re a parent, here are a few tips to help your kids process the election. (Here are tips to manage your own stress, too.)

And if you’re a teacher, it might be good to open up class for questions and reflections, since the election outcome will affect students, too.

"Taxes, Heroin and Statehood: A Glimpse Into This Year’s Ballot Measures","SAN FRANCISCO — If ever there was a doubt about the coronavirus’s impact on American democracy, look no further than the sharp decline in citizen initiatives this year. There are 38 such measures slated across the country, around half the level in the last presidential election, when there were 72.

“The pandemic has affected every aspect of our lives and direct democracy — the citizen initiatives — is no different,” said Amanda Zoch, a specialist in ballot measures at the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan group that serves members of legislatures. “You can’t go gather in-person signatures in a pandemic when you’re in a stay-at-home order and supposed to be social distancing.”

That is not to say that the initiatives that did make it onto the ballot are inconsequential.

Should abortions be banned after 22 weeks? Colorado voters are deciding.

Will one of the nation’s most liberal states legalize affirmative action? Polls suggest Californians are leaning toward no.

When all measures are tallied, including those placed by legislatures on the ballots, there are a total of 124 statewide ballot initiatives this year, down from 154 four years ago.

Voters in the conservative-leaning states of Mississippi, Montana and South Dakota are voting on whether to legalize marijuana, which is perhaps confirmation that pot is firmly a national question. Oregon is taking it to the next level, asking voters whether possession of small amounts of drugs like heroin and cocaine should be decriminalized. Washington, D.C. has a similar question on the ballot.

There are measures to raise taxes — notably in Illinois where the governor is pushing a measure that will significantly raise his own. And in Colorado, a measure proposes lowering state income tax by a smidgen — to 4.55 percent from 4.63 percent.

As usual, California is providing the nation with some of the meatiest ballot choices. Should ride-share and food-delivery drivers be treated as employees? That question has spawned the most expensive ballot initiative in U.S. history. Here’s a look at other measures we’ll be watching for on Tuesday.

At a time of sharp income inequalities, many of the proposals on the ballot bend toward a progressive vision of taxation, toward higher rates for companies and wealthy individuals. Put another way: Income redistribution is on the ballot.

Arizona’s Proposition 208 would tax the rich to funnel money into public schools. An income tax surcharge of 3.50 percent on single filers earning above $250,000 or joint filers earning more than $500,000 would come in addition to the existing 4.5 percent income tax. The additional revenue would be used to hire teachers and classroom support staff, pay for teacher training and increase salaries of existing teachers and staff. Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, opposes the measure, but it has strong support by Democrats in the state. A Monmouth University poll from mid-October showed 60 percent in favor and 34 percent opposed.

In Illinois, the ‘Allow for Graduated Income Tax’ amendment would would replace the state’s flat income tax of 4.95 percent with graduated taxes that would range from 4.75 percent to 7.99 percent. Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat and the billionaire heir of the Hyatt hotel chain, is leading the charge and has put $56.5 million of his own money into the campaign. He calls it the fair tax.

Under the proposed law, which comes in the form of an amendment to the state’s Constitution, only those making above $250,000 a year will see their taxes go up. “People like me should pay more, and people like you should pay less,” Governor Pritzker said when he introduced the proposal last year. Illinois needs the money. If the measure doesn’t succeed, the state’s debt may be downgraded to junk status by credit ratings agencies.

If voters pass California’s Proposition 15, it will be a watershed moment for a system that for decades has ensured low property taxes for longtime owners. The proposed constitutional change would raise billions of dollars for schools and local governments by lifting the protections for commercial property owners. It would tweak a landmark 1978 ballot initiative, Proposition 13, that limited property tax increases to 2 percent, even if the value of the property soared. Under the proposed amendment, commercial and industrial properties would be taxed based on their market value rather than their purchase price. In this high-stakes measure, supporters have raised $67 million and opponents $74 million. A recent poll by the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan research organization, showed near even support.

Also on the ballot are high-stakes measures for labor in both California and Florida. Amendment 2 in Florida would increase the state minimum wage to $15 in 2026 from $8.56 in 2020. California’s Proposition 22 would allow ride-share and delivery drivers to be considered contractors, not employees. A campaign led by Uber and Lyft and the delivery service DoorDash has spent $200 million to back the proposal, making it the costliest state initiative in history.

And in Alaska, oil companies have poured millions of dollars into a campaign to defeat Measure 1, which would raise taxes on oil extracted from the state’s North Slope. The money, which would be funneled into the state’s budget, would help relieve the state’s deficit. “Alaskans have received far less than Texans, North Dakotans, Russians, Iraqis, Nigerians, Brazilians and Norwegians,” says the official pamphlet backing the measure.

If Measure 110 passes, Oregon will be the first state to decriminalize small amounts of drugs such as cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine. Under the proposed law, possession of drugs would be classified as a violation, akin to a traffic ticket for not wearing a seatbelt. Backed by the singer John Legend and the Oregon Democratic Party, among others, the law would also establish a fund for drug treatment that would be financed by marijuana taxes.

Oregon Measure 109 would legalize psilocybin, the psychedelic mushroom, for people age 21 and older. “Research at America’s top universities shows that psilocybin therapy can help people suffering from depression, anxiety and addiction,” said Representative Earl Blumenauer of Oregon, a Democrat.

Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota all will vote on measures that will legalize, tax and regulate marijuana for adults age 21 and over. South Dakota is also voting on a measure that proposes legalizing medical cannabis, as is Mississippi.

If all of the marijuana measures pass, cannabis will be legal for medical use in 36 states and recreational use in 15.

The official name of Rhode Island is the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. Rhode Island Question 1 would remove the second half. Voters already had a shot at this in a ballot measure a decade ago and rejected the change. But the state’s Democrats are now counting on the momentum of the Black Lives Matter movement to approve the measure this time. “This old, festering wound still needs healing,” said State Senator Harold M. Metts, a Democrat and a co-sponsor of the measure.

In Mississippi, Ballot Measure 3 asks voters to approve a new state flag with red, yellow and blue stripes, a magnolia flower and the words, “In God We Trust.” The state’s previous flag, which dated to 1894 and contained a Confederate battle cross, was decommissioned by lawmakers in June. If the new flag is rejected by voters, it’s back to the drawing board.

In addition to Colorado’s Proposition 115, which would prohibit abortions in the state after a fetus reaches 22 weeks, Louisiana Amendment 1 would add these words to the state’s Constitution: “Nothing in this constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion, or require the funding of abortion.” The measure was supported by two anti-abortion Democrats: Gov. John Bel Edwards and State Senator Katrina Jackson.

Even in a pandemic,

the Golden State put a raft of big questions on the ballot.

Propositions 17, 20 and 25 are major criminal justice measures. Proposition 17 would restore the right to vote for felons on parole. Proposition 20 would partly rollback earlier measures that had allowed people convicted of certain felonies early parole consideration. Proposition 25 is a referendum to uphold or reject a law that will replace cash bail. Support for the law falls mainly along left-right divides. But not entirely. Opponents include California chapters of the N.A.A.C.P. who argue that the computer algorithms that will decide who is allowed pretrial freedom may work against people of color and those from poorer areas.

Proposition 16 would repeal a previous measure passed in 1996 that banned affirmative action in the state. “Californians have built the fifth largest and strongest economy in the world, but too many hardworking Californians are not sharing in our state’s prosperity,” said Shirley Weber, a sponsor of the measure and the chairwoman of the Legislative Black Caucus. Supporters are a who’s who of leading Democrats in the state. But the measure is polling poorly, perhaps a reminder that one of America’s most liberal states also has a strong libertarian streak.

Proposition 24 would strengthen California’s landmark 2018 data privacy law. It would create an agency to enforce the law and would require businesses to give consumers a say on how such data as location or race are used.

Other measures across the country would introduce ranked choice voting systems (Alaska and Massachusetts) and would remove local governments’ authority to regulate firearms (Montana). Nevada has measures that would recognizes the marriage of couples regardless of gender and a separate measure that would require utilities to acquire 50 percent of their electricity from renewable resources by 2030. Puerto Rico is asking voters about statehood, the sixth time the question has been asked. And Washington is asking voters whether to uphold a law requiring comprehensive sexual health education in public schools.

Finally, amid the dizzying diversity of proposed new laws, Arkansas and Florida have ballot measures about ballot measures. Both would make it harder to pass laws through that process."

What will a legislative campaign in Vermont tell us about changing attitudes toward gun control? Can a non-Latina be elected in Miami? Will the mayor of Portland hang on, after months of vilification from all sides?

We asked our national correspondents to share what they’ll be keeping an eye on this week.

California

After a summer of unrest over racial injustice, California voters will consider a measure aimed at dismantling systemic racism in two broad areas. Proposition 16 would reverse the state’s voter-approved ban on affirmative action in public university admissions and public contracting. Yet in a state that prides itself on its progressivism, polling has shown that it’s far from an easy win. Californians’ vote on Proposition 16 may hint at where debates over how to achieve racial equity are headed. — Jill Cowan

Vermont

In Vermont, a grieving mother is challenging a state legislator in a campaign around gun regulations, an agenda Vermonters are, gradually, beginning to embrace. Alyssa Black was propelled into politics by the suicide of her youngest son, Andrew, in 2019. When a police officer informed her about Andrew’s actions on the day he died, she was stunned. “How could you leave for work in the morning, and your son drives out, buys a gun and shoots himself?” she said. “He bought a gun in 20 minutes.” Andrew’s obituary asked mourners to push a waiting period for firearms purchases, to “guard against impulsive acts of violence.” Her plea caught on in a state whose resistance to gun regulation is softening. The waiting period bill was passed by the Legislature, then vetoed by Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican. The experience prompted Ms. Black, a Democrat, to run against State Representative Bob Bancroft, a Republican and avid gun rights supporter. — Ellen Barry

North Carolina

Henderson County in Western North Carolina is nearly 93 percent white, and more than 61 percent of its residents voted for the current occupant of the White House in 2016. That makes it an unlikely place for a Black woman who considers herself politically progressive to find an electoral breakthrough. But Debbie Roundtree, 50, who works as a cleaner at a nursing facility, hopes to become the first Black person to win a seat on the county board of commissioners. She is attempting to persuade conservative white voters that despite their differences, they have similar interests as poor and working-class people. They need a quality education for their children, affordable housing and zoning rules that don’t displace them. “What affects you affects me,” Ms. Roundtree said, describing her pitch. In a country where racial divisions are deep, this contest may tell us something about just how much the year of racial justice protests has helped to overcome the stubborn divide. — John Eligon

Miami

Miami-Dade County, Fla., is home to 2.7 million people and encompasses about 2,000 square miles. The mayor manages a $9 billion budget. The position is the second most powerful executive in Florida, after the governor. And this year, the mayor’s race has become a proxy for national politics, though it is a nonpartisan office. In the running are two county commissioners from opposite ends of the political spectrum. Esteban Bovo, a Republican known as Steve, has been campaigning with his friend Senator Marco Rubio. Daniella Levine Cava, a Democrat, was endorsed by Hillary Clinton. If Ms. Levine Cava wins, she will become the first female mayor in Miami-Dade history, its first non-Hispanic mayor in 24 years and its first Democratic mayor since 2004, a victory that would reflect an ongoing shift in Miami politics, long controlled by Cuban-American Republicans. — Patricia Mazzei

Michigan

Western Michigan is an influential region within evangelicalism, so it’s not surprising that the area now bound by Michigan’s Third Congressional District hasn’t been held by a Democrat in more than 40 years. But Representative Justin Amash’s recent break from the Republican Party may say something about his district’s current sensibilities: The race for the seat left open by his departure from Congress is a tossup. Hillary Scholten, a Democrat and an immigration lawyer, is appealing to local nostalgia for faith-rooted civility; one of her ads begins with the words “my faith is what calls me to serve.” Peter Meijer, a Republican, is an Iraq War veteran and scion of the grocery store chain bearing his name. If the seat goes to Ms. Scholten, it may indicate that certain theologically conservative churchgoers are willing to break with the Republican Party. That would be significant both for the party and for evangelicalism. — Ruth Graham

Oklahoma

A proposal to amend the Oklahoma Constitution may show how far voters will go to shrink prison populations in a state with one of the highest incarceration rates. The amendment would prevent prosecutors from using past felony convictions to lengthen sentences for defendants convicted of another felony — assuming they have never been convicted of a violent felony. Inmates already serving longer sentences for nonviolent felonies could petition for a reduction. Backers, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the American Conservative Union, say the proposal would trim prison rolls by almost 9 percent over a decade, saving $142 million, while curbing the state’s reputation for unduly harsh punishments. Opponents, including many prosecutors, say it would benefit career criminals, and make it difficult to secure longer sentences for repeat domestic abusers whose crimes are not classified as violent under the amendment. — Richard A. Oppel Jr.

Mississippi

The magnolia may be Mississippi’s state tree and its state flower, but a vote to adopt a state flag featuring a magnolia represents a momentous shift. If approved, the new flag will replace one emblazoned with the Confederate battle emblem, the last in the nation. Lawmakers voted for the change as Confederate relics were toppled and excised across the South this year. Republican lawmakers who led the effort argued that Mississippi was a poor state that could not afford any barriers to outside investment, and the flag was a big one. But the debate on the floor of the State Legislature revealed something deeper, as lawmakers — white and Black, Republican and Democrat — wrestled over what the flag ought to represent. Jerry R. Turner, a Republican representative, talked about unity: “That’s what we’ve all prayed for.” — Rick Rojas

Wisconsin

In 2018, a Democratic victory in Wisconsin’s 10th State Senate District was hailed as a sign of a coming “blue wave.” Whether the incumbent prevails on Tuesday may indicate whether a second wave of Democratic victories is upon us. Patty Schachtner won the seat in a special election, in a district in northwestern Wisconsin that was seen as solidly conservative. A Republican had held the seat for 17 years. Ms. Schachtner’s win was seen as an erosion of the president’s support. This year, she has been outspent by her Republican opponent, State Representative Rob Stafsholt. A critical issue in their campaign: the coronavirus. Mr. Stafsholt has argued that Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, overused his powers to impose restrictions on Wisconsinites. Ms. Schachtner, an early promoter of masks and social distancing, is the medical examiner for her county. — Julie Bosman

Los Angeles

Progressive prosecutors have taken office across America in recent years, promising to reduce prison populations and fight racial bias. Activists supporting their campaigns always saw Los Angeles County, with the country’s largest prosecutor’s office and jail system, as the ultimate prize. In the aftermath of the George Floyd killing in Minneapolis and nationwide protests, the Los Angeles race took on greater significance. Liberal leaders like Mayor Eric M. Garcetti pulled their endorsements of the incumbent, Jackie Lacey, who critics say has not done enough to reduce incarceration and prosecute police officers for shootings. Those endorsements, plus money from Hollywood and outside liberal groups, flowed toward the challenger, George Gascón, the former top prosecutor in San Francisco who has promised to take a tougher line on police shootings. The contest will be a bellwether for criminal justice reform and a test of whether Los Angeles’s liberal values extend to matters of crime and justice. — Tim Arango

Portland, Ore.

After a summer of protests, Portland voters will decide the fate of a politician at the center of it all. Mayor Ted Wheeler is probably best known nationally for his battles with the president, who has called him a “fool” for not ending the unrest. But the protesters also revile Mr. Wheeler for overseeing a Police Department that has repeatedly used aggressive tactics — including thick clouds of tear gas — when targeting people for arrest. Mr. Wheeler’s challenger, Sarah Iannarone, has aligned herself with the protests, declaring herself an “everyday antifascist.” It’s not clear where voters will land. One October poll had the candidates nearly tied, but 28 percent of voters remained undecided. — Mike Baker

Houston

The battle for Tom DeLay’s old seat in the Houston suburbs is about the past and future of Texas, and how one need not collide with the other. Mr. DeLay, the former House Republican majority leader known as the Hammer, represented a suburban Fort Bend County district controlled by Republicans for all but two of the past 41 years. A Democrat — Sri Preston Kulkarni, a former Foreign Service officer — has a shot at flipping it. Mr. Kulkarni is running to become the first Indian-American elected to Congress from Texas. He is at once multiethnic and old-school, much like modern Texas itself. He speaks six languages (English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, Hebrew and Russian) and claims a connection to Houston few candidates can beat: Sam Houston, the Texas statesman and the city’s namesake, is an ancestor on his mother’s side. — Manny Fernandez

Georgia

The rise of the Black Lives Matter movement has increased scrutiny of local prosecutors, among them Jackie Johnson, the district attorney in Brunswick, Ga. Ms. Johnson, who is up for re-election, was the first prosecutor involved in the case of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man who was running through a South Georgia neighborhood in February when he was pursued by three white men and killed. Mr. Arbery became a name on the lips of antiracism protesters nationwide. Ms. Johnson, a Republican, recused herself from the case early on, but her conduct is the subject of a criminal probe. Civil rights activists, angry that it took so long for murder charges to be brought against the suspects, have demanded that she step down. Her challenger, Keith Higgins, a former prosecutor, is running as an independent. Like Ms. Johnson, Mr. Higgins is white. His campaign website does not mention Mr. Arbery but does call for an end to “unethical and unfair practices of the district attorney’s office.” The language may be an effort to walk a fine line in a five-county area where white people are in the majority. — Richard Fausset"
