Pence Won’t Say the Words ‘Black Lives Matter’ in an Interview,"WASHINGTON — Vice President Mike Pence twice refused to say that “black lives matter” during an interview on a Philadelphia television station on Friday, insisting instead that “all lives matter in a very real sense.”

Mr. Pence also claimed during the interview with 6ABC Action News that Americans had cherished the idea that everyone is created equal “from the founding of this nation,” an assertion that ignores the institution of slavery during the first 100 years of the country’s history.

The vice president’s comments came on Juneteenth, a holiday that commemorates the end of slavery in America. And he refused to specifically say that black lives matter at a time when the country is convulsing in outrage about racial injustice at the hands of the police following George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis last month.

President Trump has been under fire for weeks for his response to protests in cities across the nation in the wake of Mr. Floyd’s death. His tweets calling for aggressive action by the police to quell violence have angered activists. And earlier this month, his administration ordered the police to clear protesters from streets near the White House before Mr. Trump held a photo op at a church.

In the interview, Mr. Pence called Mr. Floyd’s death “a tragedy,” but his insistence that “all lives matter” is likely to be seen as a provocation by activists and others who say that phrase dilutes the issue and fails to acknowledge the specific threats that African-Americans still face at the hands of police officers in the United States.

Brian Taff, the news anchor, pressed Mr. Pence on that point: “People are saying, of course all lives matter, but to say the words is an acknowledgment that black lives also matter at a time in this country when it appears that there’s a segment of our society that doesn’t agree. So why will you not say those words?”

The vice president said he did not accept that “there’s a segment of American society that disagrees, in the preciousness and importance of every human life.” He again refused to say that black lives matter.

“And yet, one final time, you won’t say the words and we understand your explanation,” Mr. Taff said.

Mr. Pence is due to arrive on Saturday in Tulsa, Okla., to join Mr. Trump for a Make America Great Again! rally that evening. Tulsa was the site of one of the nation’s worst examples of racial violence when a white mob laid siege to a prosperous black neighborhood, killing hundreds of people in 1921."
"Oluwatoyin Salau, Missing Black Lives Matter Activist, Is Found Dead","A 19-year-old Black Lives Matter activist whose disappearance this month led to a desperate search after she sent a series of tweets describing a sexual assault has been found dead in Tallahassee, Fla., the police said Monday.

The activist, Oluwatoyin Salau, was one of two women whose bodies were discovered in an area southeast of the city on Saturday evening, the police said. The other victim was identified as Victoria Sims, 75, an AARP volunteer who was last seen on Thursday. Officers who went to her home found that it had been burglarized and that her car was missing, the police on Tuesday as they released new details on the women’s deaths. 

A 49-year-old man, identified as Aaron Glee Jr., has been charged with murder and kidnapping in connection with their deaths, the police said.

Ms. Salau was last seen on June 6, according to the police, and friends and fellow activists raised concerns about her well-being after she wrote a number of alarming posts on Twitter that day in which she described being sexually assaulted by a man who had offered her a ride and a place to stay. 

The police said Tuesday that Ms. Salau also contacted them to report the assault, but they do not believe there was a connection between the assault and her killing.

Ms. Salau had recently gained attention as a prominent voice in protests in Tallahassee after the death of George Floyd in police custody led to a national reckoning over racism and police violence. Videos posted to social media showed Ms. Salau making impassioned speeches in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.

“Right now, our lives matter, black lives matter,” Ms. Salau said in a video that was widely circulated on Twitter. “We are doing this for our brothers and our sisters who got shot but we are doing this for every black person,” she said. “I am profiled whether I like it or not.”

Ms. Salau took part in demonstrations alongside the Tallahassee Community Action Committee, said Trish Brown, one of the founding members of the organization, which is dedicated to fighting systemic racism.

“She was a strong, young black female leader to me, and a powerful speaker,” Ms. Brown said.

Three days before Ms. Salau disappeared, Ms. Brown had sent a message to check in with Ms. Salau. “She said, ‘Love you.’ I said, ‘Love you, too,’” Ms. Brown recalled. About a week later, Ms. Brown saw a missing persons flier with Ms. Salau’s picture on it.

“I feel like something was snatched away from me,” Ms. Brown said.

Both Ms. Salau and Ms. Sims were found dead at a home in Tallahassee where Mr. Glee resided, the authorities said. They said he had left the residence before the police arrived but was later taken into custody in Orlando. Mr. Glee has not yet been appointed an attorney, the Leon County Court said.

The authorities did not say how the women had died or what connection, if any, they had to each other or to the suspect. 

Ana Sanz-Saumeth, a Black Lives Matter activist from Miami who got to know of Ms. Salau during the recent protests, said organizers in Tallahassee spoke about “how powerful her words were, how motivated she was to be more involved in the movement and share that activism with those around her.”

“She was very much a resilient person,” she added.

Black Lives Matter activists and supporters across the United States flooded social media on Monday with pictures and videos of Ms. Salau, with many pledging to continue protesting and demonstrating in her name.

For Ms. Brown, Ms. Salau’s death was another heartbreaking reminder of the need to keep advocating for justice for African-Americans.

“She humbled me. I’m going to try to live to do the good work that I have been continuing to do, but harder and harder,” Ms. Brown said. “I’m not going to stop until we get this right.”"
Public Employees Are Accused of Vandalizing Black Lives Matter Sign,"A Sheriff’s Office employee and an investigative assistant with the District Attorney’s Office in Ventura County, Calif., were among three people who have been arrested after they were caught on video damaging a roadside Black Lives Matter sign, the authorities said.

The authorities identified the three men after Max Meyers, 19, who hung the sign outside his parents’ home in Thousand Oaks, Calif., put up a surveillance camera after it was repeatedly damaged.

Secured to a fence along Westlake Boulevard, the sign consisted of sections of brown tarp with the letters “BLM” painted in white, according to The Thousand Oaks Acorn.

The Ventura County Sheriff’s Office said it recognized one of its employees, Darrin Stone, 60, in footage Mr. Meyers posted online of a man ripping through the “BLM” sign with a knife.

Mr. Stone has been employed by the Sheriff’s Office since 2005, and was assigned most recently as a service technician at the Ventura County Pre-Trial Detention Facility, the department said. Mr. Stone, who could not be reached on Sunday, was arrested on Friday and was issued a misdemeanor citation for vandalism, the Sheriff’s Office said. He was also placed on paid administrative leave, the department said.

Sheriff Bill Ayub said in a statement that his department “will not tolerate unlawful or unethical behavior.”

“I’m deeply disappointed that one of our employees involved himself in this type of illegal activity, especially when this is an infringement on someone’s First Amendment right to freedom of speech,” he said. “We will not tolerate unlawful or unethical behavior by anyone employed by our agency. We hold our employees to the highest standards, and there will be consequences for this.”

Craig Anderson, 59, an investigative assistant with the Ventura County District Attorney’s Office, was also arrested and cited for vandalism after he was spotted in video footage cutting and attempting to remove the sign on May 31, the Sheriff’s Office said.

The District Attorney’s Office said in a statement on Saturday that Mr. Anderson had resigned after working in the office for four months. Because of Mr. Anderson’s status as a former employee, the statement said, his misdemeanor citation would be referred to the state Attorney General’s Office. Mr. Anderson could not be reached on Sunday.

A third man, Jeffrey Moore, was also arrested and accused of spray-painting the sign on June 11. The Sheriff’s Office said it tracked him down using the company name and phone number that were “prominently displayed” on his work truck.

Mr. Meyers, a student at University of California, Santa Barbara, has been staying at home with his parents because of the coronavirus outbreak. He said he put up the sign a few days after the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. Last year, he put up a sign in the same spot supporting firefighters during the California wildfires. That sign was not damaged and stayed up for more than three months, he said.

“I wasn’t really convinced that the BLM poster would get the same response, to be honest,” Mr. Meyers said, “but I thought, ‘What the hell? We put up a poster for the first responders. This is 10 times more important than that.’”

Mr. Meyers’s father, Andy, said it was “mind-blowing” to learn that two of the people who have been accused of vandalizing his son’s sign were Ventura County employees.

“To have racism right here in our backyard is so disheartening and disgusting,” he said. He added that he was “so proud of my son for pushing this forward and doing the right thing.”

On Saturday night, the sign was vandalized again, Max Meyers said. However, with the recent publicity the sign has been getting, he said he hoped it would stay up, untouched, as he prepares to return to Santa Barbara in the coming days.

“But if I need to, I’ll come back from school and put it up,” he said."
How Trump and the Black Lives Matter Movement Changed White Voters’ Minds,"A majority of American voters support the demonstrations against police brutality and racial injustice that have roiled the country over the past month, embracing ideas about bias within the criminal justice system and the persistence of systemic racism that are central tenets of the Black Lives Matter movement, according to a new national poll of registered voters by The New York Times and Siena College.

Fifty-nine percent of voters, including 52 percent of white voters, believe the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police in Minneapolis was “part of a broader pattern of excessive police violence toward African Americans,” the poll found. The Black Lives Matter movement and the police had similar favorability ratings, with 44 percent of registered voters having a “very favorable” view of the movement, almost identical to the 43 percent rating for the police.

The numbers add to the mounting evidence that recent protests have significantly shifted public opinion on race, creating potential political allies for a movement that was, within the past decade, dismissed as fringe and divisive. It also highlights how President Trump is increasingly out of touch with a country he is seeking to lead for a second term: While he has shown little sympathy for the protesters and their fight for racial justice, and has continued to use racist language that many have denounced, voters feel favorably toward the protests and their cause. 

A survey of battleground states critical to November’s election largely mirrored the national results. Fifty-four percent of voters in those states said the way the criminal justice system treats black Americans was a bigger problem than the incidents of rioting seen during some demonstrations. Just 37 percent said rioting was a bigger problem, though Mr. Trump and his allies have tried to discredit the protests by focusing on some isolated incidents of violence.

It has not worked.

“I probably didn’t understand what bringing people together meant until Trump started talking the way he does,” said Rita Hopkins, 55, from rural Clark County, Mo., in the northeastern part of the state. “Now I see what a president says can divide people.”

Ms. Hopkins, a white registered Democrat who describes herself as a centrist, said she was particularly galled by Mr. Trump’s comments at one point during protests over Mr. Floyd’s death that the Secret Service had been prepared to sic the “most vicious dogs” on protesters outside the White House gates.

The words immediately brought to mind photos of the Alabama police aiming snarling dogs at peaceful black protesters.

“I hate to say it, but I had forgotten about those pictures I had seen,” said Ms. Hopkins, who lives in an overwhelmingly Republican county. “I kind of thought we had gotten past that.”

The attitudes cut across race, geography and educational status, and speak to a country that has been awakened through protests to complaints that black Americans have long made about police brutality and systemic racism. What began in the Democratic primary, in which white liberals showed a new openness to candidates speaking frankly about systemic injustice, has continued into the general election, with a spotlight on Mr. Trump’s response.

The coalition of people sympathetic to the protesters’ cause, including Latino voters, exposes the limits of Mr. Trump’s tendency to exclusively speak directly to his overwhelmingly white and conservative base. As with other issues, including the coronavirus pandemic, the administration’s narrow focus has been derided by experts and voters, who say the governing strategy does not reflect the country’s broader interests, or the current political realities.

“Over the past six years, so much of the work has been focused on convincing the country — and convincing policymakers and white communities that there’s an actual problem,” said Samuel Sinyangwe, an activist and co-founder of Mapping Police Violence. “Now there’s been universal condemnation of the George Floyd incident and a recognition that things needs to change.”

Aaron Perry, an alderman on the City Council of Waukesha, Wis., said he doesn’t support the looting that took place after Mr. Floyd’s death in various cities but said it occurred on a small scale relative to the peaceful protests that broke out.

Mr. Perry, a 40-year-old white man, describes himself as a centrist but was compelled to switch parties last year from Republican to Democrat because of his support for marriage equality and legalization of cannabis. He called himself a “never-Trumper” and said that in 2016, he wrote in John Kasich, then the governor of Ohio, on the presidential ballot.

The death of Mr. Floyd was an urgent message to the nation, he said, to make changes to end the kinds of police and societal behavior that led to the incident.

“This is the last time we have a chance to get this right. I’m on board with that,” Mr. Perry said, emphasizing, with an expletive, that he really didn’t care if “most of the people I represent don’t look like” Mr. Floyd, and that issues of racial justice matter for a majority-white area, too.

Darrell Keaton Sr., a 49-year-old black Democrat from Wausau, Wis., several hours north of Mr. Perry, said the protests after Mr. Floyd’s death were monumental for changing views on structural racism in America. Finally, he said, it feels like white people are listening and joining in the protests. 

“We have just been racking our brains and screaming at the top of our lungs for so many years that we’re going to need other people to stand up alongside the black community to change anything,” he said. 

Though the poll over all shows former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in a very strong position, especially on racial justice, and voters’ belief in his ability to unite a divided country, it also indicates how difficult a task that could be: More than 40 percent of white respondents agreed in some measure that discrimination against whites has become as big a problem as other forms of discrimination, reinforcing a theme of white grievance politics that the president and his supporters have long expressed.

There are also broad generational gaps between how voters are responding to the national moment of unrest. Every age bracket said the use of force by the police against black Americans was a bigger problem than looting at demonstrations. But support for Black Lives Matter got more tepid among older voters, the polls found. Sixty-seven percent of voters ages 18 to 29 had a “very favorable” view of the Black Lives Matter movement as did 54 percent of voters ages 30 to 44.

Among people 45 to 64, the support dropped to 37 percent, while 22 percent had a “somewhat favorable” view. Voters 65 and over were the least persuaded: Only 31 percent had a “very favorable” view of the Black Lives Matter movement, and 25 percent had a “somewhat favorable” opinion.

Michael Berlinger, 67, who lives in Lancaster, Pa., and considers himself an independent voter, said he thought the Black Lives Matter movement is too myopic. The protests over Mr. Floyd’s death have been too destructive, he said.

“The whole message has been undermined in a lot of ways,” said Mr. Berlinger, a white retired teacher. “I’m not a big fan of people who break the law to say they’re working for a cause. I don’t think that’s the correct way of doing it.”

The looting and the property destruction were “a dilution of the message and the results they wanted to achieve.” Mr. Berlinger is likely to vote for Mr. Trump, he said, but he described the choices on the Republican and Democratic ballots, respectively, as one between “a lunatic and a senile senior citizen.”

“I think all lives matter,” Mr. Berlinger said. “The black and blue lives, and red, white and blue lives.”

Charles Defever, a 28-year-old Minneapolis Democrat, said he felt this was a moment to get more involved. His activism was limited to the occasional comment in support of Black Lives Matter on social media — until he saw the video of George Floyd’s arrest, he said.

“I was not very active, and my interest would fade,” said Mr. Defever, who is white and works as a produce buyer for a food wholesaler. “I would write on the Black Lives Matter page and see truth and pain and hurt in so many people I know but would not go out and protest.”

“I’ve spent a lot of time at the State Capitol listening to young black and brown youth speak about the world they want, and that’s the world I have,” he said.

Mr. Defever was a supporter of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont but said he planned to vote for Mr. Biden because he was “better than having destructive Republican policies and leadership.”

Many activists, progressive political groups, and civil rights organizations draw a direct line to these changing attitudes and the events of the recent months. Renewed attention ignited by the death of Mr. Floyd — as well as others who died at the hands of police, including Breonna Taylor of Kentucky, Rayshard Brooks of Georgia, and Elijah McClain of Colorado — has built on other moments of awakening, like the surprise of the 2016 election of Mr. Trump, said Nell Irvin Painter, a historian and the author of “The History of White People.”

“The great stall point after the civil rights movement was white people not being able to talk to other white people about whiteness,” Ms. Painter said. “That has to happen before anything can change. Now, many white people are stepping up and saying, ‘Oh we’ve got to talk about this.’”

D’Atra Jackson, national director for Black Youth Project 100, the progressive political organization that has been on the front lines of the national protests, agreed that this is a unique political moment. However, Ms. Jackson said it is important to maintain pressure on people seeking elected office so that public sympathy can be transformed into action — getting people elected and getting legislation passed.

“It’s one thing to be hopeful and believe that new things are possible,” Ms. Jackson said. “It’s another thing to build power.”"
Boy Scouts Announce Diversity Merit Badge and Support for Black Lives Matter,"The Boy Scouts of America said this week that the organization would create a “diversity and inclusion” merit badge and make earning it a requirement of becoming an Eagle Scout, the highest scouting rank. The nonprofit also joined a growing number of organizations announcing public support for racial equality and the Black Lives Matter movement.

The Texas-based organization, which was formed in 1910 and reports more than 2.2 million youth members, has frequently been criticized for a lack of inclusivity.

For decades, openly gay people were not allowed to be members or adult leaders, a stance that began to change only in 2013. Almost three-quarters of its youth membership is white, with black members making up less than 7 percent, according to a tally from the end of 2018.

In a statement on Monday from the executive committee, the Boy Scouts said the group would do more to make sure “every person feels that they belong, are respected, and are valued in scouting.”

The organization said that it would make diversity and inclusion training mandatory for its staff, starting July 1, and that it would work with local councils to ensure that property names, events and other insignia do not bear “symbols of oppression.” The Boy Scouts said the review would “build on” an existing 30-year ban on displays of the Confederate flag.

Effie Delimarkos, a spokeswoman for the Boy Scouts, said the organization was still working on the details of how a scout would earn the diversity and inclusion merit badge. The development of a new badge typically takes years, but she said the timeline would be expedited in this case.

The organization said in the statement that it would incorporate elements from existing badges that “require scouts to learn about and engage with other groups and cultures to increase understanding and spur positive action.”

“We believe that Black Lives Matter,” the organization’s statement declared, saying the group stood with black families and individuals. “This is not a political issue; it is a human rights issue and one we all have a duty to address.”

The Boy Scouts had initially put out a much broader statement on June 3, with no mention of race, and focusing instead on teaching scouts “to become the best versions of themselves.”

“I was shocked and deeply disappointed that their original statement made no reference to the experiences of black people, the pain that the black community was feeling,” said Dwayne Fontenette Jr., 29, an Eagle Scout who also has volunteered as a scout leader.

Mr. Fontenette then helped write a letter last week, signed by more than 500 scouts, calling for the Boy Scouts to take a stronger stance against “anti-black racism.” He said in an interview that he was “moved” by the organization’s statement this week.

“It represented for me the first time in my scouting history where I feel like the organization saw me, and valued me completely,” he said.

Mr. Fontenette, who is black, said the Boy Scouts still had an “extraordinary amount of work to do to create an environment in which black people have equal access and equal outcomes in scouting, and an experience in which we are made to feel as we belong.”

Since the death of George Floyd during an arrest by the Minneapolis Police prompted protests nationwide over racial equality, many organizations and businesses have been eager to publicly embrace the cause. Apple pledged $100 million toward a racial justice initiative. Sephora said it would devote at least 15 percent of its shelf space to black-owned products, and companies like Nike, Twitter and Citigroup have all aligned themselves with the Black Lives Matter movement.

The Boy Scouts’ statement came as membership in the organization has dwindled in recent years. While more than 130 million Americans have participated in the Boy Scouts since its inception, shifting American attitudes have pulled families away from the God-and-country oaths and outdoorsy survival skills associated with the Scouts.

The organization has made a number of progressive changes in recent years.

In 2013, the group ended its ban on openly gay youths participating in its activities. Two years later, the Boy Scouts ended a ban on openly gay adult leaders. In January 2017, it said it would begin accepting members based on the gender listed on their applications, paving the way for transgender youth to join the organization.

And while girls had been allowed in some programs, like Sea Scouts, since the early 1970s, the Boy Scouts said in 2017 that the organization would begin allowing girls in its other core programs.

Last year, Scouting Magazine reported that more than 61,000 people became Eagle Scouts.

But the organization has also been embroiled in scandal. In February, the organization filed for bankruptcy after thousands of people came forward with allegations that they were sexually abused by scout leaders, with many filing lawsuits against the Scouts.

Benjamin Jordan, a professor at Christian Brothers University who has researched the history of scouting, said this week’s statement contrasted with the more exclusive reputation the Scouts had developed in recent decades. But he pointed out that the Boy Scouts had, even in the 1920s, sought to encourage the creation of black troops in the Southeast through a program called the “interracial service,” despite conservative pushback.

“This move,” he said, “is more a return to their past rather than a new departure.”"
"Cory Booker on Newark Pride, Black Lives Matter and ‘This Distraught Present’","Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey has long made criminal justice core to his politics, a focus that began during his days at Stanford, continued through his two terms as mayor of Newark and eventually formed the backbone of his presidential campaign.

Now, amid a groundswell of protests against racism and police brutality, Mr. Booker, the longest tenured black Democrat currently in the Senate, finds himself at the center of a defining national moment. He also became a voice of outrage earlier this month when a bill making lynching a federal crime, which he helped write, was held up over the objections of one senator, Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky.

We spoke to Mr. Booker about the shifting politics of race, his own experiences, and where this movement can go in the future. These are lightly edited excerpts from the conversation.

Far more than ever, in a very short period of time, millions of Americans are starting to say black lives matter. What do you make of that?

It’s showing that this country is truly growing and evolving and beginning to see and confront a lot of the systemic racism in our country, overt racism in our country, and how it affects not just the lives of black Americans, but how it undermines the truth and the promise and the possibilities for all of America.

Do you worry that this might just be a moment that will pass?

I’m certainly hopeful that it won’t pass. There are signs of hope in America right now, to see in all 50 states, millions of people being involved in some kind of activism or protests, virtually or in the streets. You’re seeing diversity, a coalition of people from all ethnic backgrounds, ages, religious backgrounds. You’re seeing major organizations come out and speak not only to the issues of racism but to their own complicity or culpability in that. From NASCAR to the N.F.L., from major companies to colleges.

But we are only in the foothills of the mountain we have to climb and the work that we have to do. And the question ultimately is, How will systems from health care to education to criminal justice — the systems that have so disparately impacted Americans along race — how will they actually fundamentally change?

Are issues like health care and education getting attention during this moment?

They’re not getting enough attention. And the violence against black people is not just what we witness with George Floyd. It’s that race is still the biggest indicator of whether or not you are going to live near a toxic site, breathe dirty air, drink dirty water. Racism is the most profound indicator of what kind of education you get, about how economically fragile your family might be, about whether you’re food insecure. These are issues that are combined to create this distraught present.

I remember the column you wrote in The Stanford Daily in 1992 about being stopped by police officers as you drove over the George Washington Bridge. How often do you think about that experience?

Often. Often. I mean, look, I’m still very conscious when I’m not dressed like a senator, and even when I am, that I still could be one misunderstanding away from a very bad incident. But I also realize that I’m in a position of power to do something about these issues.

And, you know, my Newark experiences have profoundly shaped my perspective on these issues. We came in as reformers, and we really believed in good faith, with a majority black City Council and black mayor, that we were doing a real good job when it came to changing our police practices.

But we were confronted by a Department of Justice investigation. And it dredged up the data that we were not moving fast enough. And it is a testimony to these issues — they can’t be gotten rid of with good intentions. So, this has been a life’s work for me from the time I was in college writing about policing issues to the time I was a reformer as a mayor to the time I’ve been a United States senator.

And I almost feel, and it’s not the best word, but I almost feel a sense of shame that here I am, 30 years of adulthood since Rodney King, and the lessons that I got in my teenage years from African-American adults who wanted to make me afraid of police for my own safety, who wanted to teach me coping mechanisms, I feel just a sense of profound regret that I’m having to have those conversations with young black men in my life, my mentees or my nephews. And that is really hurtful to me that we’ve had three decades since that horrific beating of a black man who was so demonized, so stripped of his humanity, like so many black Americans have been in policing practices.

The history of policing in this country, and its treatment of African-Americans, is thoroughly documented for every generation of being so far short of the highest ideals of this country. It’s been an affront to the very dignity of the nation as a whole. You can’t be comfortable with this. And it’s our comfort with it that has allowed it to fester.

On the campaign trail you told people to come see your city of Newark. Its peaceful protests have made national news. Why do you think the city has responded this way?

Protest traditions in Newark are in our genes. We elevate our protesters to elected office. I’m proud of [Mayor] Ras Baraka. His father was Amiri Baraka. His father was beaten by police on the streets of Newark during the dark periods of the [1967] riots. He’s a leader that people trust, people know.

I’m proud that I can go jogging in Newark and feel sometimes safer there with no security or anything like that — in my own community that many people are still afraid of — than I can in many other communities where people might not recognize a black man jogging, or follow them like we saw with Ahmaud Arbery. So, I love my community. I feel this deep loyalty to them.

Why do you think Rand Paul held up your anti-lynching bill?

I don’t know what he was thinking. Remember, Kamala [Harris] and I didn’t precipitate that conflict. He brought the bill up. And on that day that George Floyd was being memorialized. 

I was very angry going down to the floor, that on this day in particular, he was choosing to have this confrontation. And it was a confrontation, and his willingness to stymie the passing of this legislation was deeply hurtful to so many Americans.

During the Democratic primary campaign, you had some critical words for former Vice President Joe Biden about his record on criminal justice. Are you at all worried that he’s the face of the party right now in this moment?

Well, I actually have been quite excited about Joe Biden in this last month. There’s something that he’s showing to me, that is so profoundly needed in our leadership in this country, which is humility and vulnerability. He’s showing vulnerability by saying, I don’t have all the answers. It is so counter to the toxic masculinity and weakness that this president is showing, who says he has all the answers and never apologizes.

Joe Biden is showing this extraordinary strength and he is humbling himself to talk about the kinds of teams he wants to build, and how inclusive and diverse it will be. I really think he sees himself as a bridge to the next generation of American leaders, and for him to talk openly about a woman vice president, a black woman Supreme Court justice.

Do you think he needs to pick a black woman as his running mate?

I trust him. I know he will weigh all of the competing issues of the day to come up with a person that can help lead us in this tumultuous time, so I trust that he will make the right decision.

You have introduced multiple criminal justice bills in the last couple of years, like legalizing marijuana, reconsidering long sentences and supporting incarcerated women. What gives you hope that these bills can pass?

It’s the American people. And I mean that sincerely. The suffrage movement, the civil rights movement, the disabilities rights movement, the L.G.B.T.Q. movement, the workers’ rights movement. All of these movements preceded major pieces of legislation, from the Americans With Disabilities Act, the Civil Rights Act of ’64, a lot of our most hallowed labor laws. All of them were preceded by ordinary Americans making an extraordinary commitment to be a part of the fight for justice.

The bill that I have authored [on police misconduct] this past week — it would not have been possible to get the majorities of the Democrats in Congress on it a month ago. But because of the activism of millions of Americans, it moved the needle of the possible. Well, we have to move it a lot more."
Arthur Ashe Statue in Virginia Vandalized With ‘White Lives Matter’,"A monument to the black tennis legend Arthur Ashe in Richmond, Va., was vandalized with spray paint that read “WLM” and “White Lives Matter” on Wednesday.

Mr. Ashe, a Richmond native, became the first black man to win Wimbledon, the Australian Open and the U.S. Open. His statue is on the city’s Monument Avenue, a residential street that extends for five miles into Henrico County and is dotted with a number of prominent Confederate monuments.

Passers-by said they saw a man in a blue T-shirt, dark red baseball cap and American flag bandanna spray paint “WLM” on the pedestal of the statue.

“We heard spray can rattling as we walked around the monument,” said Betsy Milburn, 45, who was walking along the avenue with her friend Fatima Pashaei.

As Ms. Milburn and Ms. Pashaei turned to the man, whose face was partially covered by his bandanna, he spoke to them.

“He said ‘You guys tagged my statue so I am tagging your statue,’” Ms. Milburn said. The man then walked to a white car and drove off, she said.

Someone also spray painted “BLM” for Black Lives Matter in pink over the initial “WLM” graffiti. Volunteers cleaned the monument, and all of the “White Lives Matter” graffiti was removed before the end of the day.

Virginia has seen over two weeks of protests against racism and police brutality, just like every other state in the country. Demonstrators were motivated by the death of George Floyd, a man who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Mr. Floyd’s neck for several minutes.

On Tuesday night, protesters tore down the Howitzers Monument near Monroe Park campus, part of Virginia Commonwealth University. The monument was the third Confederate statue to be torn down by protesters in the state.

A woman who lived near Mr. Ashe’s statue arrived with cleaning supplies on Wednesday, and Ms. Milburn and Ms. Pashaei took turns cleaning the graffiti off the statue.

The man in the blue T-shirt came back later with a white cloth and tried to clean off the pink “BLM” letters.

“Why is it OK to spray paint on this statue ‘Black Lives Matter’ and not ‘White Lives Matter’? What’s the difference?” the man asked the women as they scrubbed the pedestal, according to a video shared by Ms. Milburn. “I’m not a racist, I just don’t agree with desecrating our property.”

The man told bystanders that he grew up in Richmond and that he attended a local high school. When asked his name, he replied, “Everybody.”

“Everybody that is here that has property value, everybody here that has paid to live here and is tired of seeing this,” the man said on the video, using expletives.

He then drove off as the women continued to clean the pedestal.

“I’m not sure why he felt the need to desecrate the one black statue on Monument Avenue,” Ms. Pashaei said in an interview Wednesday. “These Confederate generals might all be dead, but their foot soldiers are still alive and active here in Richmond.”

By the time Mr. Ashe’s nephew David Harris Jr. arrived at the statue, someone had cleaned the “WLM” and left “BLM,” he said. Mr. Harris had received several calls alerting him to the vandalism.

“I was disheartened about it,” Mr. Harris said. “People are outraged that people choose to vandalize a statue that represents peace, prosperity, inclusion, education, and the life and true fabric of the country: children.”

“It lets us know that there are folks out there that don’t believe in being inclusive,” he continued. “They believe in discriminatory acts and racism still.”

Mr. Ashe, a world-class tennis player, believed his trailblazing success provided him with the duty to stand against privilege, poverty and racism.

When Mr. Ashe died in 1993, he was lain in state at the Executive Mansion in Richmond. His statue on Monument Avenue was dedicated three years later to memorialize him and to provide a balance with the statues on the avenue dedicated to Confederate leaders.

When asked what he thought his uncle would say about the current climate in the United States, Mr. Harris did not hesitate.

“I don’t think he would be too surprised, but I think he would understand the nature of what the people are upset about, what the people are fighting for,” Mr. Harris said.

“I think he would support Black Lives Matter because what we are dealing with is not police brutality, it is a myriad things that has been woven into the fabric of America,” he said. “Some of those threads need to be yanked out.”"
Black Trans Women Seek More Space in the Movement They Helped Start,"Transgender women of color were leaders in L.G.B.T.Q. activism before, during and after the uprising at the Stonewall Inn 51 years ago on Sunday, but they were never put at the center of the movement they helped start: one whose very shorthand, “the gay rights movement,” erases them.

Though active in the Black Lives Matter movement from the beginning, they have not been prioritized there either. At no point have black trans people shared fully in the gains of racial justice or L.G.B.T.Q. activism, despite suffering disproportionately from the racism, homophobia and transphobia these movements exist to combat.

But now, as the two movements are pulled together by extraordinary circumstances — the protests sparked by the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery; the killings of two black trans women, Dominique Fells and Riah Milton, shortly after a black trans man, Tony McDade, was killed by the police; a pandemic that has disproportionately affected people of color; an economic crisis that has disproportionately affected trans people; and a Supreme Court decision protecting gay and trans people from employment discrimination, all coming to a head during Pride month — black trans people are mobilizing more visibly than ever before.

This moment, advocates say, is long overdue, and they are determined not to let it slip away.

For decades, the idea that “we were all minorities was enough for people to just say, ‘OK, that’s what we have in common, so if I win, that means you automatically are winning, too,’” said Peppermint, a black trans activist who co-hosted the Black Queer Town Hall, a three-night series of virtual performances and discussions this month. “I think that the notion of intersectionality is becoming more readily available for people to understand that a win for one group or one identity doesn’t necessarily equal an automatic win for the other.”

While L.G.B.T.Q. people have secured many legal rights and protections, black transgender women are still killed so often that the American Medical Association has declared it an epidemic. Last year, 91 percent of the transgender or gender-nonconforming people who were fatally shot were black women, according to the Human Rights Campaign. This year, at least 16 trans people have been killed — almost certainly an underestimate, because many cases go unreported and many victims are misgendered.

“So much money and resources and energy has been put into legislative fights or judicial fights, which is important — those wins are important,” the activist Raquel Willis said. “But as a black trans woman, I often have to grapple with the question of, what do any of these protections mean if I am dead, if I am still at risk of literally being killed?”

Violence against transgender people increased after President Trump was inaugurated, advocacy groups found in 2017, and Mr. Trump has singled out trans people in his policies since the beginning of his presidency.

His administration reversed Obama-era protections for transgender students, reimposed a ban on trans people serving in the military and, just this month, erased rules protecting them from discrimination in health care. It also sought to define gender as an immutable trait assigned at birth — an effort that would, essentially, define trans people out of legal existence.

“The attacks on the trans community are at every level, and it’s coming from the highest office in this country, and it has from Day 1,” said Sarah Kate Ellis, president of the L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy group GLAAD. “I think that black trans people and trans people of color are mobilizing and using this platform and this moment because you can’t have black lives matter without having black trans lives matter.”

In recent weeks, donations to grass-roots organizations that help black trans people, bail funds and individual fund-raisers have surged.

And two weeks ago, 15,000 people showed up for the Brooklyn Liberation march after the killings of Mr. McDade, Ms. Fells and Ms. Milton.

Ms. Willis was one of the speakers at the protest, as was Melania Brown, the sister of Layleen Polanco, who was active in the ballroom scene in New York as a member of the House of Xtravaganza and who died last year after having a seizure in a cell in Rikers Island, where guards failed to check on her.

“Fifteen thousand people should now be the number that always serves as the bare minimum when state-sanctioned violence happens against black trans people,” said Ianne Fields Stewart, founder of The Okra Project, a collective that provides black trans people with home-cooked meals prepared by black trans chefs.

Nala Toussaint, the founder of Reuniting of African Descendants, a grass-roots healing initiative for L.G.B.T.Q. people of African descent, said the trans community had always taken care of its own by “making sure that we have food in our stomach, making sure that our folks have housing, making sure that there’s lights and building utilities running.”

What is new is the national visibility of black trans people as movement leaders, and the prominence of their structural demands.

Calls to redistribute police funding to education and public housing could benefit black transgender people, who because of widespread transphobia have some of the highest rates of homelessness and unemployment in the country. More than one in four transgender people have lost a job because of bias, and more than three-fourths have experienced workplace discrimination, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality.

The idea of defunding the police is also tied to efforts to change the criminal justice system more broadly: Peppermint noted, for instance, that decriminalizing sex work could reduce interactions between officers and trans people, especially black trans women, which can be traumatic or even deadly.

A report from the N.C.T.E. found that 22 percent of transgender people who interacted with the police reported harassment. For black trans people, and especially sex workers, the number was higher.

Black trans activists are also calling for the redistribution of resources within mainstream L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy organizations that have usually been led by white, cisgender people.

National nonprofits with strong funding “need to get serious about reallocating resources to black- and brown-led grass-roots initiatives,” Ms. Willis said, “and they need to really reorient themselves around who they consider to be a leader.”

Historically, mainstream L.G.B.T.Q. rights groups have focused more on white gay people and lesbians than on trans people or people of color. While that has begun to change, there remains a well of mistrust and a conviction that effective advocacy will need to be led by black trans people.

“They don’t know the first thing about what it is to live a life like we have, and they have no comprehension as to what it is we suffer and go through,” said Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, one of the last surviving leaders of the Stonewall uprising. “So I myself do not participate in groups that are led by white people, because they just don’t understand.”

That lack of understanding is part of what advocates are trying to address.

Daniella Carter, a black trans woman from Queens, said that in high school, her classmates seemed to be “just learning what L.G.B.T. meant, let alone what transgender meant.”

Ms. Carter, now 26, was homeless and did sex work for much of her adolescence. But at times, “it wasn’t navigating survival sex work that felt like it was the burden, it was having to go to school and watch an entire classroom move away from me,” she said. “Because not only was I a burden to that space, there wasn’t even enough language out there yet to talk about what acceptance looked like.”

Her life changed, she said, after she saw Janet Mock on the cover of Marie Claire magazine.

It was the first time she had seen a trans woman “who reflected that woman I always dreamed of — the woman who is black, who’s powerful, who can present herself chic,” she said. “I said to myself, ‘I don’t know how, but I have to get in touch with this woman.’ I’m like, ‘That’s me, and I need to learn how to be that.’”

Ms. Carter did get in touch with Ms. Mock and other black trans activists, and eventually went to film school. This weekend, she released a video that highlighted trans people and emphasized their resilience — part of an effort to increase the visibility of trans people’s stories, and not just the ones in which they are victims.

A similar impulse was behind the Black Queer Town Hall, which Peppermint said stemmed from the many conversations she had with Bob the Drag Queen, her friend and co-organizer, about the killings of black trans people.

“We said to each other, ‘We need to do something that is more celebratory,’” she said. “Because all of the conversation around this only focuses on the terrible parts of this, which need to be talked about, but we wanted a moment to celebrate queer black excellence.”

The premiere of “Disclosure,” a Netflix documentary executive produced by Laverne Cox, has drawn new attention to Hollywood’s depictions of trans people. New York City Pride’s annual rally on Friday — held virtually this year — was hosted by two black trans people, Brian Michael Smith and Ashlee Marie Preston.

This sort of public visibility is very much new. Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, trans women who were key figures in the Stonewall uprising, got a monument in New York last year, although neither lived to see it.

But Miss Major, one of their fellow leaders at Stonewall, is still alive, a fact she phrases in defiant terms: “I’m still here,” with an expletive.

Miss Major, 79, was executive director of the Transgender Gender-Variant Intersex Justice Project and now runs a house for trans people in Arkansas.

She has been vocal about the erasure of black trans people in the broader L.G.B.T.Q. movement, and said in an interview this week that while she hoped this moment would be different, she did not expect it to be unless her community fought loudly for itself.

“What I tell the girls is that they’ve got to keep fighting,” she said. “They must keep fighting. Because if they don’t succeed and do the work, we’ll get left behind, and one thing we cannot accept is being left behind this time.”"
Nextdoor Removes App’s ‘Forward to Police’ Feature,"Following complaints about racial profiling on its platform, the popular neighborhood social media app Nextdoor has discontinued a feature that had allowed users to forward their crime and safety posts from within the app to law enforcement agencies.

The action to eliminate the feature, Forward to Police, which was introduced in 2016, was announced last week amid complaints from some users that Nextdoor was not being responsive to their concerns that racial profiling and racist remarks were prevalent on the app. Founded in 2010, the app is used in 11 countries — including the U.S. — and reportedly has millions of users, though it declines to give a figure. 

“As part of our anti-racism work and our efforts to make Nextdoor a place where all neighbors feel welcome, we have been examining all aspects of our product — we had specifically been examining ‘Forward to Police’ for many months — and we made the decision to accelerate the deprecation of this feature,” a company spokeswoman said this week.

While Nextdoor did not say specifically why it had focused on Forward to Police in its anti-racism work, the spokeswoman did say, “With the removal of Forward to Police there are no features on Nextdoor that exist solely for members to message law enforcement agencies.”

On June 12, Joseph Porcelli, who leads Nextdoor’s global public agency, alerted the Minneapolis Police Department that the company was removing the feature from its app, Bloomberg CityLab reported. Mr. Porcelli cited “engagement metrics” as a reason for discontinuing the feature.

Despite the elimination of Forward to Police, users will still be able to directly message public agencies like police, fire and health departments through the Nextdoor app.

Nextdoor indicated that it had reduced “problematic posts” that involve racial profiling by 75 percent and that currently “less than 0.001 percent of all posts on Nextdoor are related to racial profiling.”

On May 31, before it removed the Forward to Police feature, Nextdoor shared on Twitter a graphic in support of Black Lives Matter. The statement prompted criticism online as some users have accused Nextdoor of censoring their Black Lives Matter posts. Nextdoor’s public statement came at a time when many companies were voicing support for Black Lives Matter as well as reckoning with their internal racial makeup and inequities.

Three users interviewed this week said they believed the app had sometimes fostered a negative atmosphere.

Nayeli Villalobos, who lives in Denver, Colo., said she had noticed users making assumptions about people on the app based on race.

“I do have a lot of neighbors who do post, ‘Saw a suspicious man walking by,’ and just because they’re black doesn’t mean they’re suspicious,” Ms. Villalobos said.

Mariesa Hayes, a Nextdoor user from Seal Beach, Calif., said that she had posted recently on the app about a “Black Lives Matter Peaceful March,” and that it was taken down.

“There’s a lot of people that, unfortunately, are stuck in their ways,” Ms. Hayes said. “I thought that there would be more people that were positive and on my side and stuff, but I don’t really feel that, at least not right now.”

Tina Layson, who lives in Boulder City, Nev., said she hadn’t used the app much in the last few weeks after some users denounced a community demonstration that was organized in response to the death of George Floyd in police custody.

“I’ve lived here for 30 years,” Ms. Layson said. “It’s been upsetting to see some of the comments people have made in reference to black people or just people of color in general.”

In a statement released on June 11, Sarah Friar, Nextdoor’s chief executive, apologized to black Nextdoor users who said “they do not feel welcome and respected” on the platform. That same day, Nextdoor sent an email to moderators on the app, telling them to permit discussions about Black Lives Matter, according to The Verge, which obtained the email.

According to its community guidelines Nextdoor prohibits discrimination and hate speech on its platform.

 In addressing racial profiling, the app requires users to be detailed when posting about incidents, asking users to include descriptions beyond race, such as hair color, clothes and shoes.

Nextdoor said that it was taking a comprehensive approach to alter the ways in which users share safety-related posts on the app, and consulting with outside experts to provide feedback on product development.

“Just one incident is too many,” the spokeswoman said. “We remain committed to the hard work — listening to and learning from experts and our members and taking action to improve our product.”"
"A Debate Over Identity and Race Asks, Are African-Americans ‘Black’ or ‘black’?","[Please sign up here to have the Race/Related newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox.]

It’s the difference between black and Black. A longtime push by African-American scholars and writers to capitalize the word black in the context of race has gained widespread acceptance in recent weeks and unleashed a deep debate over identity, race and power.

Hundreds of news organizations over the past month have changed their style to Black in reference to the race of people, including The Associated Press, long considered an influential arbiter of journalism style. Far more than a typographical change, the move is part of a generations-old struggle over how best to refer to those who trace their ancestry to Africa.

The capitalization of black, which has been pushed for years, strikes at deeper questions over the treatment of people of African descent, who were stripped of their identities and enslaved in centuries past, and whose struggles to become fully accepted as part of the American experience continue to this day.

“Blackness fundamentally shapes any core part of any black person’s life in the U.S. context, and really around the world,” said Brittney Cooper, an associate professor at Rutgers University whose latest book, “Eloquent Rage,” explores black feminism. “In the choice to capitalize, we are paying homage to a history with a very particular kind of political engagement.”

The move toward Black is not embraced by all African-Americans, and two of the country’s major news outlets, The New York Times and The Washington Post, are still wrestling over whether to make the change.

“Black is a color,” said the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, the longtime civil rights leader who popularized the term “African-American” in an effort to highlight the cultural heritage of those with ancestral ties to Africa. “We built the country through the African slave trade. African-American acknowledges that. Any term that emphasizes the color and not the heritage separates us from our heritage.”

There are also concerns that turning black into a proper noun lumps people of the African diaspora into a monolithic group and erases the diversity of their experiences. Some have said it bestows credibility upon a social construct created to oppress black people. Perhaps the most notable concern is what to do about white and brown as racial identifiers.

So far, most news organizations have declined to capitalize white, generally arguing that it is an identifier of skin color, not shared experience, and that white supremacist groups have adopted that convention.

But some scholars say that to write “Black” but not “White” is to give white people a pass on seeing themselves as a race and recognizing all the privileges they get from it.

“Whiteness is not incidental,” the sociologist Eve Ewing wrote on Twitter in arguing to capitalize white as well. She added: “Whiteness is a thing. Whiteness is endowed with social meaning that allows people to move through the world in a way that people who are not white are not able to do.”

At a recent online meeting of Race/Related, a cross-desk team devoted to race coverage at The Times, a discussion of whether to capitalize black or not made clear that there is not universal agreement, even among African-Americans on the staff.

“It has been the subject of a lively and surprising debate,” said Dean Baquet, the Times’s executive editor, who has indicated that he will announce a decision on the issue soon.

The debate over racial vocabulary is unfolding amid growing recognition across society of the need to tackle racism after several high-profile police killings of black people incited mass protests nationwide.

The acceptable terms in America for identifying black people have evolved over generations, from colored to Negro to black and African-American. Also commonly used is “people of color,” an umbrella term used to include many ethnic minorities.

In the aftermath of the George Floyd killing, which has unleashed a national conversation on questions of race and racism, many say the country is long overdue to standardize the use of the uppercase B in black, which has been commonly used at black media outlets for a long time.

The New York Amsterdam News, for instance, describes itself as “the oldest Black newspaper in the country that offers the ‘New Black View’ within local, national and international news for the Black community.”

The debate among black people in America over how they should be described has often centered on identity as a political statement.

In her 1904 essay “Do We Need Another Name?” Fannie Barrier Williams, an educator and activist, described a lively discussion unfolding at the time among African-American scholars over whether to shed the label Negro in favor of terms like colored or Afro-American. Colored, she wrote, was a “name that is suggestive of progress toward respectful recognition.”

At the heart of the discussion, she wrote, was whether African-Americans needed a new label divorced from Negro and its connections to slavery, something of a fresh start that indicated their new place in society as free people.

Some, like W.E.B. Du Bois, favored keeping the term Negro and transforming it into something positive — an affirmation of their perseverance as a people and their freedom.

“There are so many Negroes who are not Negroes, so many colored people who are not colored, and so many Afro-Americans who are not Africans that it is simply impossible even to coin a term that will precisely designate and connote all the people who are now included under any one of the terms mentioned,” Barrier Williams wrote.

Negro became the predominant identifier of people of African descent for much of the first half of the 20th century, and even then descendants of enslaved people from Africa waged a yearslong campaign before getting most of society, including The Times, to capitalize it.

With the rise of the Black Power movement in the mid-1960s, the word black, once seen as an insult for many African-Americans, started winning embrace. In just a few years, it became the predominant descriptor of black people as Negro became obsolete. Mr. Jackson’s campaign brought African-American into popular use in the late 1980s, and it is now often used interchangeably with black.

For proponents of capitalizing black, there are grammatical reasons — it is a proper noun, referring to a specific group of people with a shared political identity, shaped by colonialism and slavery. But some see it as a moral issue as well.



It confers a sense of power and respect to black people, who have often been relegated to the lowest rungs of society through racist systems, black scholars say.

“Race as a concept is not real in the biological sense, but it’s very real for our own identities,” said Whitney Pirtle, an assistant professor of sociology specializing in critical race theory at the University of California, Merced. “I think that capitalizing B both sort of puts respect to those identities, but also alludes to the humanities.”

Vilna Bashi Treitler, a professor of black studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said that racial categories were fabricated, created to denigrate people considered to be nonwhite. Black and white are adjectives, not proper nouns to be capitalized, she said, calling a term like “African descendant” a more appropriate way to characterize black people.

“It’s a placeholder for describing the group of people who are perpetually reinserted into the bottom of the racial hierarchy,” Dr. Bashi Treitler, the author of the book “The Ethnic Project,” said of the term black. “I think we can be more revolutionary than to embrace the oppressor’s term for us.”

In her first two books, Crystal M. Fleming, a sociologist and author, lowercased black in part because of academic differences between race and ethnicity. But the more she researched, the more those distinctions became blurred in her mind. She came to see race as a concept that could signify a politically and culturally meaningful identity.

Now Dr. Fleming, a professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and the author of “How to be Less Stupid About Race,” is writing a book for young people about fighting racism. She has decided to use Black.

Part of the reason, she said, was her desire to honor black experiences and speak with moral clarity about antiracism. Another reason was more basic, born in the urgency of the current moment.

“Frankly,” she said, “because I want to. That’s also something that I think we need to see more of in every field — black people doing what we want to do.”

The Black Officer Who Detained George Floyd Had Pledged to Fix the Police,"MINNEAPOLIS — There were two black men at the scene of the police killing in Minneapolis last month that roiled the nation. One, George Floyd, was sprawled on the asphalt, with a white officer’s knee on his neck. The other black man, Alex Kueng, was a rookie police officer who held his back as Mr. Floyd struggled to breathe.

Mr. Floyd, whose name has been painted on murals and scrawled on protest signs, has been laid to rest. Mr. Kueng, who faces charges of aiding and abetting in Mr. Floyd’s death, is out on bail, hounded at the supermarket by strangers and denounced by some family members.

Long before Mr. Kueng was arrested, he had wrestled with the issue of police abuse of black people, joining the force in part to help protect people close to him from police aggression. He argued that diversity could force change in a Police Department long accused of racism.

He had seen one sibling arrested and treated poorly, in his view, by sheriff’s deputies. He had found himself defending his decision to join the police force, saying he thought it was the best way to fix a broken system. He had clashed with friends over whether public demonstrations could actually make things better.

“He said, ‘Don’t you think that that needs to be done from the inside?’” his mother, Joni Kueng, recalled him saying after he watched protesters block a highway years ago. “That’s part of the reason why he wanted to become a police officer — and a black police officer on top of it — is to bridge that gap in the community, change the narrative between the officers and the black community.”

As hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated against the police after Mr. Floyd’s killing on May 25, Mr. Kueng became part of a national debate over police violence toward black people, a symbol of the very sort of policing he had long said he wanted to stop.

Derek Chauvin, the officer who placed his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes, has been most widely associated with the case. He faces charges of second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter; Mr. Kueng and two other former officers were charged with aiding and abetting the killing. At 26, Mr. Kueng was the youngest and least experienced officer at the scene, on only his third shift as a full officer.

The arrest of Mr. Kueng, whose mother is white and whose father was from Nigeria, has brought anguish to his friends and family. “It’s a gut punch,” Ms. Kueng said. “Here you are, you’ve raised this child, you know who he is inside and out. We’re such a racially diverse family. To be wrapped up in a racially motivated incident like this is just unfathomable.”

Two of Mr. Kueng’s siblings, Taylor and Radiance, both of whom are African-American, called for the arrests of all four officers, including their brother. They joined protests in Minneapolis.

In a Facebook Live video, Taylor Kueng, 21, appeared with the head of the local N.A.A.C.P. to speak of the injustice that befell Mr. Floyd, acknowledging being related to Mr. Kueng but never mentioning his name.

Mr. Kueng’s sister Radiance posted a video of Mr. Floyd’s final minutes on Facebook. “Just broke my heart,” she wrote. In an interview, she said that as a black man, her brother should have intervened. She said she planned to change her last name in part because she did not want to be associated with her brother’s actions.

“I don’t care if it was his third day at work or not,” she said. “He knows right from wrong.”

Through his life, Mr. Kueng straddled two worlds, black and white.

Mr. Kueng, whose full name is J. Alexander Kueng (pronounced “king”), was raised by his mother, whom he lived with until last year. His father was absent.

As a child, Mr. Kueng sometimes asked for siblings. Joni Kueng, who lived in the Shingle Creek neighborhood in north Minneapolis, signed up with an African-American adoption agency.

When Alex was 5, Ms. Kueng brought home a baby boy who had been abandoned at a hospital. Alex soon asked for a sister; Radiance arrived when he was 11. Taylor and a younger brother came in 2009, when Alex was about 16.

Radiance Kueng, 21, said their adoptive mother did not talk about race. “Race was not really a topic in our household, unfortunately,” she said. “For her adopting as many black kids as she did — I didn’t get that conversation from her. I feel like that should have been a conversation that was had.”

Growing up, Mr. Kueng and his family made repeated trips to Haiti, helping at an orphanage. Mr. Kueng and his siblings took a break from school to volunteer there after the earthquake in 2010.

Joni Kueng, 56, likes to say that the Kuengs are a family of doers, not talkers.

“I had to stay out of the race conversations because I was the minority in the household,” Ms. Kueng said in her first interview since her son’s arrest. She said that race was not an issue with her, but that she was conflicted. “It didn’t really matter, but it does matter to them because they are African-American. And so they had to be able to have an outlet to tell their stories and their experience as well, especially having a white mom.”

Ms. Kueng taught math at the schools her children went to, where the student body was often mostly Hmong, African-American and Latino. Classmates described Alex Kueng as friends with everyone, a master of juggling a soccer ball and a defender against bullies. Photos portray him with a sly smile.

Darrow Jones said he first met Mr. Kueng on the playground when he was 6. Mr. Jones was trying to finish his multiplication homework. Mr. Kueng helped Mr. Jones and then invited him into a game of tag.

When Mr. Jones’s mother died in 2008, Ms. Kueng took him in for as long as a month at a time.

By high school, Mr. Kueng had found soccer, and soon that was all he wanted to do. He became captain of the soccer team; he wanted to turn pro. The quote next to his senior yearbook picture proclaimed, “We ignore failures and strive for success.”

Mr. Kueng went to Monroe College in New Rochelle, N.Y., to play soccer and study business. But after surgery on both knees, soccer proved impossible. Mr. Kueng quit. Back in Minneapolis, he enrolled in technical college and supported himself catching shoplifters at Macy’s.

About that time, he started talking about joining the police, Ms. Kueng recalled. She said she was nervous, for his safety and also because of the troubled relationship between the Minneapolis police and residents.

Given his background, Mr. Kueng thought he had the ability to bridge the gap between white and black worlds, Mr. Jones said. He often did not see the same level of racism that friends felt. Mr. Jones, who is black, recalled a road trip a few years ago to Utah with Mr. Kueng, a white friend and Mr. Kueng’s girlfriend, who is Hmong. Mr. Jones said he had to explain to Mr. Kueng why people were staring at the group.

“Once we got to Utah, we walked into a store, and literally everybody’s eyes were on us,” recalled Mr. Jones, whose skin is darker than Mr. Kueng’s. “I said, ‘Alex, that’s because you’re walking in here with a black person. The reason they’re staring at us is because you’re here with me.’”

By February 2019, Mr. Kueng had made up his mind: He signed up as a police cadet.

Only a few months later, his sibling Taylor, a longtime supporter of Black Lives Matter who had volunteered as a counselor at a black heritage camp and as a mentor to at-risk black youths, had a confrontation with law enforcement.

Taylor Kueng and a friend saw local sheriff’s deputies questioning two men in a downtown Minneapolis shopping district about drinking in public. They intervened. Taylor Kueng used a cellphone to record video of the deputies putting the friend, in a striped summer dress, on the ground. “You’re hurting me!” the friend shouted.

As the confrontation continued, a deputy turned to Taylor Kueng and said, “Put your hands behind your back.” “For what?” Taylor Kueng asked several times. “Because,” said the deputy, threatening to use his Taser.

Taylor Kueng called home. Mr. Kueng and their mother rushed to get bail and then to the jail. “Don’t worry, I got you,” Mr. Kueng told his sibling, hugging Taylor, their mother recalled.

Mr. Kueng reminded his sibling that those were sheriff’s deputies, not the city force he was joining, and criticized their behavior, his mother recalled.

After Taylor Kueng’s video went public, the city dropped the misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct and obstructing the legal process. The sheriff’s office announced an official review of the arrests, which resulted in no discipline.

Mr. Kueng’s choice to become a police officer caused a rift in his friendship with Mr. Jones.

“It was very clear where we stood on that,” said Mr. Jones, a Black Lives Matter supporter who protested on the streets after the deaths of Jamar Clark and Philando Castile at the hands of Minneapolis-area police. “Our fundamental disagreement around law enforcement is not that I believe cops are bad people. I just believe that the system needs to be completely wiped out and replaced. It’s the difference between reform and rebuilding.”

After Mr. Kueng became a cadet, Mr. Jones went from seeing Mr. Kueng twice a month to maybe three times a year. He said he did not even tell Mr. Kueng when the police pursued him for nothing and then let him go.

In December, Mr. Kueng graduated from the police academy. For most of his field training, Mr. Chauvin, with 19 years on the job, was his training officer.

At one point, Mr. Kueng, upset, called his mother. He said he had done something during training that bothered a supervising officer, who reamed him out. Ms. Kueng did not know if that supervisor was Mr. Chauvin.

Mr. Chauvin also extended Mr. Kueng’s training period. He felt Mr. Kueng was meeting too often with a fellow police trainee, Thomas Lane, when responding to calls, rather than handling the calls on his own, Ms. Kueng said.

But on May 22, Mr. Kueng officially became one of about 80 black officers on a police force of almost 900. In recent years, the department, not as racially diverse as the city’s population, has tried to increase the number of officers of color, with limited success.

That evening, other officers held a small party at the Third Precinct station to celebrate Mr. Kueng’s promotion. The next evening, he worked his first full shift as an officer, inside the station. On that Sunday, he worked the 4 p.m. to 2 a.m. patrol shift, his first on the streets.

On May 25, Mr. Kueng’s third day on the job, Mr. Kueng and Mr. Lane, now partnered up despite both being freshly minted rookies, were the first officers to answer a call of a counterfeit $20 bill being passed at a corner store. They found Mr. Floyd in a car outside.

After they failed to get Mr. Floyd into the back of a squad car, Mr. Chauvin and Tou Thao, another officer, showed up.

As Mr. Chauvin jammed his knee into the back of Mr. Floyd’s neck, Mr. Kueng held down Mr. Floyd’s back, according to a probable cause statement filed by prosecutors.

Mr. Chauvin kept his knee there as Mr. Floyd repeated “I can’t breathe” and “mama” and “please.” Through the passing minutes, Mr. Kueng did nothing to intervene, prosecutors say. After Mr. Floyd stopped moving, Mr. Kueng checked Mr. Floyd’s pulse. “I couldn’t find one,” Mr. Kueng told the other officers.

Critics of the police said the fact that none of the junior officers stopped Mr. Chauvin showed that the system itself needed to be overhauled.

“How do you as an individual think that you’re going to be able to change that system, especially when you’re going in at a low level?” said Michelle Gross, president of Communities United Against Police Brutality in Minneapolis. “You’re not going to feel OK to say, ‘Stop, senior officer.’ The culture is such, that that kind of intervening would be greatly discouraged.”

All four officers have been fired. All four face 40 years in prison. Mr. Kueng, who was released on bail on June 19, declined through his lawyer to be interviewed. He is set to appear in court on Monday.

A day after Mr. Floyd’s death, Mr. Jones learned that Mr. Kueng was one of the officers who had been present. Around midnight, Mr. Jones called Mr. Kueng. They talked for 40 minutes — about what, Mr. Jones would not say — and they cried.

“I’m feeling a lot of sadness and a lot of disappointment,” Mr. Jones said. “A lot of us believe he should have stepped in and should have done something.”

He added: “It’s really hard. Because I do have those feelings and I won’t say I don’t. But though I feel sad about what’s occurred, he still has my unwavering support. Because we grew up together, and I love him.”

Mr. Jones said he had gone to the protests but could not bring himself to join in.

White Americans Say They Are Waking Up to Racism. What Will It Add Up To?,"One recent afternoon, while washing his car, Greg Reese, a white stay-at-home dad in Campton, Ky., peeled off the Confederate flag magnet he had placed on its trunk six years earlier. He did not put it back on.

It was a small act for which he expected no accolades. It should not have taken the police killing of George Floyd, Mr. Reese knew, to face what he had long known to be true, that the flag he had grown up thinking of as “a beautiful trophy” was “a symbol of hate, and it’s obviously wrong to glorify it.”

The sustained outcry over Mr. Floyd’s death has compelled many white Americans to acknowledge the anti-black racism that is prevalent in the United States — and to perhaps even examine their own culpability for it. It is as though the ability of white people to collectively ignore the everyday experience of black people has been short-circuited, at least for now.

Large numbers of white Americans have attended racial justice demonstrations, purchased books about racial inequality and registered for webinars on how to raise children who are anti-racist. Some have asked themselves pointed questions, like how much professional advantage they have garnered from being white, and whether they would willingly cede it if they could. Others are going to tattoo parlors to cover up images of Confederate flags, swastikas and Ku Klux Klan symbols on their bodies.

It is hard to know how deep or wide these responses run — and whether they are the result of pressure from peers to appear tolerant, or if meaningful action will follow. Anti-racism activists have specified concerns that are not about only symbols or slurs but entire systems governing how Americans live.

Some of the same communities where white liberals have been marching with “black lives matter” signs have seen steep resistance to efforts to integrate public schools and neighborhoods. And what some consider a profound questioning of white supremacy can seem laughably little and unconscionably late to others. The most frustrating thing about this moment, said Jeremy O. Harris, a playwright and the writer of “Slave Play,” is “listening to white people say this is the first time they realize how bad it is.”

In interviews, some white Americans admitted that even the process of reflecting on racism underscored for them how little they grasp the everyday experience of being black in America.

Research shows there is scant interpersonal contact between white and black Americans: One in five white respondents to a poll from the Public Religion Research Institute last year said that they rarely or never had an interaction with someone of a different race. In a 2013 study by the same group, a nonpartisan nonprofit, respondents were asked to identify the race of as many as seven people with whom they had discussed important matters in the six months before the survey. Among white respondents, 75 percent named only white individuals as their core friendship network.

“Many white Americans have chosen places to live, places to send their children to school, places to vacation, jobs to pursue, in ways that allow them to avoid thinking about racial inequality,” said Jennifer Chudy, a political scientist at Wellesley College. Her research suggests that only one in five white Americans consistently express high levels of sympathy about racial discrimination against black Americans.

The combination of the coronavirus pandemic, an economic collapse and a bungled emergency response by the Trump administration indirectly laid the foundation for the furor among white Americans that followed the cellphone video of Mr. Floyd’s death.

“All of that, I believe, is converging at this point to make people, white people in particular, think through America,” said Carol Anderson, author of “White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide” and a professor of African-American studies at Emory University. “What kind of nation is this, that can be comfortable with a police officer kneeling on someone’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds? And when you start asking that question, then all of the kinds of narratives and shibboleths begin to quake.”

It was the words of Mr. Floyd’s daughter, Mr. Reese said, that propelled him to join the activist group Southern Crossroads and to create a “Rednecks for Black Lives” decal that he hopes will appeal to politically conservative friends and neighbors. The group’s leaders say that majority-white, working-class communities like Mr. Reese’s stand to benefit by forming multiracial alliances.

“The one thing that flipped me and made me really want to do something was when that baby said that her daddy changed the world,” said Mr. Reese, referring to comments by Mr. Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna. “And I want to make that true. I want that baby’s words to come true.”

A shift in the priorities of white Americans regarding racial equality, race scholars said, is critical to achieving it. In the first two weeks of coast-to-coast protests, support for the Black Lives Matter movement increased by nearly as much as it had the previous two years, according to Civiqs, an online research firm. Just over half of American voters support the movement, and in dozens of towns that held protests, the population was almost exclusively white.

“This is the first time that I think a lot of us have felt that the battle is legitimately joined,” the author Ta-Nehisi Coates said on “The Ezra Klein Show” last week. Significant swaths of people in nonblack communities, Mr. Coates said, have come to perceive something of the deep pain and suffering experienced by black Americans. “I think that’s different.’’

One source of angst for white Americans who say they want to dismantle racism, though, is not knowing precisely where to start. They worry about sounding racist and not sounding sufficiently anti-racist. Some have made misguided offers of cash to black acquaintances who feel condescended to. Others have formed anti-racist study groups with other white people — but worry that those, too, are lacking.

“I’ll be thinking, ‘Constantly acknowledging racism right now, it’s so draining,’” said Erin Lunsford, 29, of Richmond, Va., who has engaged in dozens of conversations regarding defunding the police, a popular policy proposal among anti-racism activists that she initially rejected. “And then I’m like, ‘Imagine being a black person doing that your whole life.’”

In the month since Mr. Floyd’s death, a museum on the courthouse square in Sumner, Miss., dedicated to Emmett Till, whose horrific 1955 murder helped to galvanize the civil rights movement, has received 10 times the usual number of calls. Patrick Weems, executive director of the Emmett Till Memorial Commission — which founded the museum — said the callers were white Americans wanting to contribute to preservation projects or to help develop curriculum. Dozens more downloaded a smartphone app that guides users on a virtual tour of civil rights history.

Since the first week of protests, Akbar Watson, the owner of a black bookstore in Boynton Beach, Fla., has been slammed with book sales and requests from customers as far away as California and Maine. One day, he said, he sold 40 books before lunch. Another day, a woman in Ohio purchased 34 black children’s books for her daughter’s school classroom. And for the first time in his 28 years in business, he has sold out of books about racial inequalities.

“These are white Americans who are calling and ordering books to try to educate themselves and to try to figure out what to do as a response to what is happening,” said Mr. Watson, 60, the owner of Pyramid Books, who spent Saturday hand-delivering books in Palm Beach County.

Matt Bartley, a tattoo artist in Pikeville, Ky., has fielded more than 20 requests to cover up racist tattoos since he began offering the free service after Mr. Floyd’s death. One client had the words “Mein Kampf” tattooed on him, by his father, when he was a teenager, Mr. Bartley said. Similar services are being performed by tattoo artists in Dallas; Murray, Ky.; Charlottesville, Va.; Maryville, Tenn.; and Nashville.

Among Mr. Bartley’s clients was Kyle Kessler, a 29-year-old who had a Confederate flag tattoo covered last week.

Mr. Kessler said he did not see the Confederate flag as a racist symbol until recently. He got the tattoo when he was 18, in tribute to one of his favorite bands.

But in conversations with his wife and sister about Mr. Floyd’s death, he began to wonder what impact the flag has on black Americans. He also wondered what the repercussions could be for his 3-month-old son and whether he would be setting the wrong example.

“With everything going on, he’s going to be taught that’s racist, which I now know it is,” Mr. Kessler said. “I didn’t want him thinking, ‘Daddy’s got that and it’s racist, so it’s OK to be racist.’”

Mr. Kessler said Mr. Floyd’s death, and the protests that followed, have made him think differently about Black Lives Matter. Now, Mr. Kessler said he appreciated that people were standing up for themselves and their right to equality. His new tattoo — the same guitar but without the Confederate banner — reflects that changing perspective.

In Somerset, a small town in southwestern Pennsylvania, Cindy Kinsella, 61, said she knew far more police officers than black people — her brother is a state police officer in Maryland, and she knows plenty of corrections officers.

She was not sure what to make of the protests when her son told her he was helping to plan a demonstration. She wished him luck. Then she thought a little more about it.

“I got off the phone and thought, ‘You know what? I’m going to take my grandson, who is 12, and we’re going down,’” she recalled. “Just because I thought we could educate ourselves a bit.”

They went to the rally and though they did not march, they watched and listened to the speakers. It was peaceful, nothing like some of the violent protests she had seen in photographs and videos.

It is unclear what he got out of it. But she said she changed her thinking on some things, like the phrase “black lives matter.”

“Before,” she said, “I thought, ‘Why do we have to say black lives matter? Because all lives matter, police lives matter, white lives matter.’ But as they explained a little bit, ‘We’re not saying all lives don’t matter. It’s that all lives can’t matter until black lives matter.’”

Juneteenth 2020 in Photos,"The New York Times has fourteen photographers around the country capturing celebrations and protests today. This article will be updated throughout the day with more pictures.

Both the sun and a flag rose early Friday morning over the state capitol in Madison, Wis. One heralded a new day in 2020, the other symbolized freedom.

It is Juneteenth, the annual commemoration of the day in 1865 when a group of enslaved people in Texas received the long overdue news of their liberation, two years after the Emancipation Proclamation.

This year, the holiday — cherished always by African-Americans — feels bigger, more urgent as a nation gutted by a series of violent deaths of black people has given way to outsized demonstrations and protests against police brutality and the enduring clutch of racism.

Juneteenth reminds us that freedom, as a lived experience, is still not shared equally. But it is also an observance of resilience in a centuries-old journey. It is black joy and black hope and the protection of black hearts and black celebration in the very streets where demonstrators have shouted the names of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Rayshard Brooks.

So on Friday, the Juneteenth flag — a star bursting forth across a rippling banner of red, white and blue — rose with the morning light over the Wisconsin Capitol for the first time.

In Tulsa, Okla., two women stood close together on a street painted with Black Lives Matter, America’s most urgent plea.

"Louisville Police Fire Brett Hankison, Officer in Breonna Taylor Shooting","The Louisville Metro Police Department on Tuesday fired one of the three officers involved in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor, the most significant action yet in a case that has drawn public outrage for the killing and the fact that no criminal charges have been filed.

In a termination letter posted to the department’s Twitter account, Chief Robert Schroeder accused the former officer, Brett Hankison, of violating its policy on the use of deadly force, saying he “wantonly and blindly” fired 10 shots into Ms. Taylor’s apartment on March 13.

After Ms. Taylor’s boyfriend shot one officer in the leg as they broke down her door during a drug raid, the officers returned fire and killed Ms. Taylor, 26.

Questions about Ms. Taylor’s death intensified after George Floyd was killed by the Minneapolis police in May. Weeks of protests in Louisville, Ky., followed, and Mayor Greg Fischer banned no-knock warrants.

Officials have not brought charges against Mr. Hankison or the two other officers at Ms. Taylor’s apartment, where no drugs were found. Those officers, Jon Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove, have been placed on administrative reassignment.

Details of the shooting took months to emerge, but recent revelations from the Police Department suggest that Mr. Hankison acted recklessly by shooting through a patio door and window that had an obstructed view. Some of the rounds he fired went into a neighbor’s apartment and endangered the lives of three people there, according to Tuesday’s letter.

Chief Schroeder wrote that Mr. Hankison’s conduct was “a shock to the conscience” and that his actions discredited the Police Department.

The city’s former police chief, Steve Conrad, was fired this month after the police shot and killed a business owner during protests over Ms. Taylor’s death. Officers did not activate their body cameras during that encounter or during the raid that ended in Ms. Taylor’s death.

Ms. Taylor, an emergency medical technician, was shot at least eight times when the police tried to serve a no-knock warrant, which allows officers to enter people’s homes without identifying themselves.

The police said they did announce themselves in Ms. Taylor’s case, but her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, said he did not hear their warnings.

Lonita Baker, one of three lawyers representing Ms. Taylor’s family, said last week that the decision to charge Mr. Hankison lies with Kentucky’s attorney general, Daniel Cameron.

Mr. Hankison has 10 days to appeal his firing."
"With Tweets, Videos and Rhetoric, Trump Pushes Anew to Divide Americans by Race","[Follow our Election Day live tracker.]

President Trump has repeatedly pushed inflammatory language, material and policies in recent days that seek to divide Americans by race as he tries to appeal to his predominantly white base of voters four months before Election Day rather than try to broaden his support.

Trailing in national polls and surveys of crucial battleground states, and stricken by a disappointing return to the campaign trail, Mr. Trump has leaned hard into his decades-long habit of falsely portraying some black Americans as dangerous or lawless. And he has chosen to do so at one of the most tumultuous periods in decades as Americans protest recent episodes of police brutality against black people that have highlighted the nation’s long history of racial injustice.

Over the last few days the president has tweeted context-free videos of random incidents involving black people attacking white people and baselessly argued that President Barack Obama, the country’s first black leader, committed “treason.” In an interview with the Catholic News Agency that was posted online on Monday, Mr. Trump said he planned to sign an order to protect national monuments at a time when statues of Confederate generals are being torn down across the country.

“We’re going to do an executive order,’’ Mr. Trump said. “We’re going to make the cities guard their monuments, this is a disgrace.”

Leaving for a trip to Arizona on Tuesday, Mr. Trump spoke of protesters near the White House the night before who tried to remove a statue of Andrew Jackson, declaring that he wants “long-term jail sentences for these vandals and these hoodlums and these anarchists and agitators.”

As president, Mr. Trump has rarely been so inflammatory on race in such a narrow window of time, from his recent tweet about a doctored video purportedly showing a “racist baby” to his use of a racist phrase — “Kung flu” — to describe the coronavirus at his rally in Tulsa, Okla., on Saturday.

On Tuesday, Twitter suspended the account of the meme creator who is a favorite source of material for the president, and who had produced the “racist baby” video that Mr. Trump tweeted.

Asked about Mr. Trump’s statements, Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman, pointed to the president’s recent executive order related to policing and said he had a “tremendous record” on issues related to black Americans. “The president has also firmly stood for law and order and against violent destruction and vandalism, and he knows that all communities need to be able to live in peace in order to have prosperity,” he said.

Mr. Trump, who has waged only one campaign before this one, is effectively running a primary contest in a general election. Answering to his own instincts and what he thinks “my people” want, as he often puts it to advisers, the president is exploiting racial divisions in a way that appeals to only a segment of his party.

As political strategy goes, it’s confounding: First-term presidents historically have sought to broaden their support before their re-elections, but it’s especially peculiar given the fast-shifting views of moderate white voters and some Republicans on matters of race.

“I can speak from personal experience in Oklahoma City: white Republicans are having these uncomfortable conversations and are wanting to have them,” said David F. Holt, the city’s Republican mayor. “I’m seeing a broad consensus of support and empathy for the issues being raised by the Black Lives Matter movement.”

While Mr. Trump’s views on race and the protests have been out of step for weeks with many Americans, he has, in recent days, tried to rally his supporters on matters related to race, such as claiming without evidence that progressives have broadly labeled his voters as racists. In tweets, videos and at his campaign rally last Saturday, he has portrayed protesters as a threat in ways that are bound to heighten divisions rather than unite cross-sections of Americans.

A new New York Times Upshot/Siena College survey illustrates the chasm between the president and even many right-leaning voters on issues of race. While Mr. Trump rages about protesters and threatens them with violence, large portions of his party are far less hostile.

Over half of voters surveyed who said they were somewhat conservative, and even a quarter of voters who called themselves very conservative, had a favorable view of the Black Lives Matter movement.

Just as significant, some Republican-leaning voters are plainly uneasy with Mr. Trump’s conduct in the last month. About 46 percent of somewhat conservative voters said they disapproved of the president’s handling of the racial justice protests, and 70 percent of moderates said the same.

In ignoring those trends, Mr. Trump is appealing directly to his most conservative, devoted supporters, whom he has constantly been afraid of losing but who are hardly sufficient to re-elect him.

As his political challenges have intensified, Mr. Trump is stepping up his focus on race and “heritage,” in references to totems like statues of Confederate generals. He has vowed to defend a statue of Jackson, the president who owned slaves and signed a law that led to the forcible removal of thousands of Native Americans from their lands.

On Monday night, Mr. Trump retweeted users who posted video featuring black people physically assaulting white people, including one that was a year old. Days earlier, Twitter affixed a “manipulated media” tag to a video Mr. Trump tweeted that portrayed a fabricated CNN segment in which Trump supporters were maligned as racist.

At his rally in Tulsa, which drew far fewer supporters than anticipated, Mr. Trump made no mention of the massacre of black residents in the city’s Greenwood section in 1921, or of the Juneteenth holiday a day earlier that celebrated the end of slavery. Instead, he again bemoaned the tearing down of statues.

In an interview on Fox News on Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump said that people who ignore history will repeat it, and then said: “You don’t want to take away our heritage and our history and the beauty.”

As protesters try to tear down statues of a range of historical figures and spray paint buildings, including the St. John’s Church adjacent to the White House, some Democrats are beginning to cringe.

But Mr. Trump has been unwilling to spotlight the destruction of statues dedicated only to broadly popular figures, such as George Washington and Ulysses S. Grant. His inclination on race is always to reach for the most incendiary rhetoric, lest his supporters miss the point.

In some ways, his conduct recalls the period leading up to the 2016 Republican nomination, when he twice called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States and openly wielded race in a way that appealed to large segments of the G.O.P., but also alienated many people in the party.

Mr. Trump, however, is no longer a political novice running in a crowded field in which he needs to garner only a plurality to claim victory — as he did in 2016. He’s a sitting president facing a difficult re-election at a moment the country has been battered by crises and is desperately seeking leadership.

No matter how much his advisers and lawmakers nudge him to project unity and bigness, however, he keeps bingeing on the political equivalent of comfort food — convinced that it’s what his most loyal supporters crave.

But some aides and more than a few Republicans worry that, satisfying as this approach may be to him in the moment, it does not offer a path to 270 Electoral College votes, let alone help the G.O.P. retain the Senate. And it is a separate conversation from the one a large chunk of the country not glued to Mr. Trump’s Twitter feed is having.

“He’s not disciplined enough to focus on that,” Terry Sullivan, a longtime Republican strategist, said of a re-election-only strategy. “He needs the constant quick fix of people loving him.”

Mr. Trump, continued Mr. Sullivan, is “the Rod Stewart of politicians — he may keep coming up with new material but deep down he knows his fans just want to hear ‘Wake Up Maggie,’ so he keeps playing the same tune because he can’t stand the thought of them not loving his performance.”"
A Reckoning With Race to Ensure Diversity for America’s Face Abroad,"WASHINGTON — Tianna Spears dreamed for years of becoming an American diplomat. She quit in January after two, and says she will never return to the State Department, given what she has described as its failure to protect her from racial discrimination — from the United States government — while on the job.

Ms. Spears is black. Her first foreign post, in 2018, was at the American Consulate in Ciudad Juárez, just over the Mexican border from El Paso. Over six months, she said, U.S. border officials pulled her aside about 25 times for extensive questioning and inspections.

She was asked if she was a drug dealer. At one point, she said, she was told to not look a male officer in the eye. The Customs and Border Protection officers questioned whether her diplomatic passport was counterfeit. At times she felt threatened. And her white colleagues, Ms. Spears said, appeared to cross the border easily and without delay.

When she reported the episodes to her supervisors at the consulate, Ms. Spears said she was advised against speaking out and was transferred to the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City.

“The message was: ‘You are now in Mexico City — focus on your job and be quiet,’ ” Ms. Spears said in an interview last week. 

Officials at Customs and Border Protection in Washington have denied Ms. Spears’s accusations, and said in a statement that it conducted a two-month internal investigation that “found no evidence of misconduct.” In its own statement, the State Department said it took Ms. Spears’s allegations “very seriously.”

The State Department statement also said it was working to “increase the diversity of our work force and foster a more inclusive organization.” But Ms. Spears’s case, first revealed in a blog post that she published last month after the killing of George Floyd, has struck a nerve in the American diplomatic corps.

It illustrated what current and former officials described as a State Department culture of endemic slights and disparaging treatment of employees who are people of color and women, prompting their exodus and whitewashing diversity from the face of the United States abroad.

Last week, the American Embassy in Seoul removed a Black Lives Matter banner that had hung from its building for three days. It had meant to show “our support for the fight against racial injustice and police brutality as we strive to be a more inclusive & just society,” according to the mission’s official Twitter site.

Officials later said it was taken down to avoid any appearance of support to any specific organization, even though the American ambassador in Seoul, Harry B. Harris Jr., had tweeted a picture of it to note that with “diversity we gain our strength.” Mr. Harris is Japanese-American.

That was followed by the departure of the department’s only African-American assistant secretary of state, who resigned over President Trump’s heavy-handed response against mostly peaceful protests that have demanded greater equality for black people after the deaths of Mr. Floyd and others in cases of police brutality.

“The president’s comments and actions surrounding racial injustice and Black Americans cut sharply against my core values and convictions,” Mary Elizabeth Taylor, a political appointee who oversaw the State Department’s interaction with Congress, wrote in her resignation letter.

That the State Department has long been filled with “pale, male and Yale” diplomats, as the common refrain goes, is well established. What is new is what Uzra Zeya, a former acting assistant secretary of state who is Indian-American, described as an opportunity in “this watershed moment for America” amid a national conversation about eradicating discrimination.

Ms. Zeya, who retired in 2018 after 27 years in the Foreign Service, said that the conversation was long overdue at the State Department, where she and others recounted futile attempts to report bias or appeal adverse career assignments, only to be brushed aside.

In her case, Ms. Zeya said, she was given no official explanation for being blocked from senior leadership assignments after serving as the chargé d’affaires — the No. 2 spot — at the U.S. Embassy in Paris during the Trump and Obama administrations. Instead, she was quietly told that she and another female diplomat, who is African-American, did not pass the “Breitbart test” — a reference to the conservative news site that she understood to mean political loyalty toward Mr. Trump, despite the State Department’s nonpartisan mission.

“I did feel that I didn’t look the part, despite the fact that my performance was beyond reproach and bulletproof,” said Ms. Zeya, who is now chief executive for the nonpartisan Alliance for Peacebuilding.

“It was certainly something I never imagined,” she said. “And the inability of the department to address it was also profoundly disappointing, and gave me no choice in the end but to leave the institution that I had devoted most of my adult life to supporting.”

The State Department employs around 76,000 people worldwide, about one-third of whom are career Foreign Service officials and Civil Service employees.

Black employees make up 15.3 percent of the Foreign Service and Civil Service employees, a slightly higher average than the 13.4 percent of African-Americans in the national population. About 7.3 percent of the career employees are Asian — slightly more than the 5.9 percent average.

Hispanic employees are far underrepresented, making up 7.4 percent of the department’s career work force despite accounting for 18.5 percent of the population. And 44.1 percent of career State Department employees are women, compared to a population that is 50.8 percent female.

Far fewer women and minority employees hold senior-level career jobs at the State Department. Women make up 36.3 percent of those posts, while Asians hold 5.3 percent, Hispanics hold 4.5 percent and black people 3 percent, according to State Department data as of last March, the most recent available.

Promotion rates in the Foreign Service, the elite diplomatic corps, paint an even starker picture.

Data provided to The New York Times show that only 80 black Foreign Service officers and specialists were promoted in the 2019 fiscal year — 1 percent of 8,023 diplomats who competed.

The promotion process is highly competitive and, over all, only 1,496 diplomats were selected, the 2019 data show. That included 108 Hispanics, 106 Asians and 90 people of other minority group. Promotions were given to 549 women. The overwhelming majority of promotions went to white men.

Of 198 ambassadors currently serving in embassies overseas, only three career envoys are black; another four are Hispanic, according to the American Academy of Diplomacy.

In a letter to employees this month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that department officials were working “diligently to find the best, most committed and broadly diverse talent to deliver excellence in American diplomacy.”

“I am proud that the composition of our State Department work force also reflects America’s devotion to the principle of equal opportunity,” Mr. Pompeo said.

Fellowships and other recruiting programs specifically looking to hire people of color have been underway for years at the State Department. But in some cases, they have also had the unintended effect of adversely singling out its recruits among their peers.

A former diplomat, Kashia Dunner, joined the Foreign Service after winning a Charles B. Rangel diversity fellowship in 2010. During introductory training courses, she said, the award became more of a stigma than an honor as white classmates routinely assumed that the minority students had qualified only because of the fellowship.

“I suddenly felt really ashamed and embarrassed about it,” said Ms. Dunner, who is black.

Later, while serving at the U.S. Consulate in Tijuana, Mexico, she said she was advised against participating in Black History Month events because they would “typecast” her. She also was told that she intimidated others because of her height, race and hair.

Filing an Equal Employment Opportunity complaint became a struggle that she believed would make little difference, and otherwise speaking out or pushing back risked damaging her “corridor reputation” — a peer-enforced system with an outsize influence when selecting diplomats for choice assignments.

In 2016, while posted at the U.S. Consulate in Erbil, Iraq, Ms. Dunner earned an annual State Department human rights award for her work with ethnic and religious minorities who had been victimized by Islamic State fighters. But at her next assignment, in San Salvador, “my boss at one point just told me flat out, ‘Your work is fine, but we just don’t like you,’ ” she recalled.

“How do you recover from that?” she said.

She left the Foreign Service in 2017. The State Department declined to discuss the specifics of her case but said in a written statement that “if the allegations are true, she deserved better during her time here.”

Congress has become increasingly worried about the lack of diversity at the State Department and the number of diplomats of color who voluntarily leave.

“People who bring diversity to the State Department will help us more than others, because we’ll have a Foreign Service that reflects America,” Representative Brad Sherman, Democrat of California, said at a virtual hearing last week.

As with other federal agencies, the State Department is working on diversity and inclusion plans to recruit, retain and promote more women and employees of color. “We have built an inclusive workplace in which every employee is treated with dignity and respect and feels empowered to serve the American people,” the department said in a statement in November.

Two months later, Ms. Spears left the State Department, having been told by an embassy medical official that she had developed anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. She attributes it to her interactions with the border guards and “unresolved trauma” that no one was held responsible. 

“People are starting to ask themselves these questions that aren’t difficult, like if black lives matter,” she said in the interview. “The State Department, America’s government institutions, have a responsibility to create a change. And the rest of us are waiting to see how they respond.”"
Virginia Sheriff Apologizes for Arrest of Black Pastor Who Called 911,"A Virginia sheriff has apologized to a black pastor who was arrested earlier this month after he called 911 to report that a group of white people were trespassing on his property and taunting him with racial slurs.

The pastor, Leon K. McCray, 61, called the authorities during the confrontation, which began when he saw two people hauling a refrigerator to the dumpsters at the apartment building he owns in Edinburg, Va., on June 1.

Mr. McCray, who declined to comment when reached by phone, told WUSA-TV that the two people became angry when he asked them to leave the property. They quickly returned, he said, with three friends, who were also white. Mr. McCray said that the five people surrounded him and began using racial slurs, and that one head-butted him while another shoved him from behind.

In a sermon on June 7, a video recording of which he posted to YouTube, Mr. McCray told his congregation at the Lighthouse Church and Marketplace Ministries in Woodstock, Va., that one of the people “ran to me full speed snatching his shirt off, jumping in my face, and then he circled around behind me.”

“These same individuals were threatening my life telling me that my black life and the Black Lives Matter stuff, they don’t give a darn about that in this county and they could care less and ‘we will kill you,’” Mr. McCray said.

Fearing for his life, Mr. McCray told WUSA-TV that he pulled out his gun and “pointed it down to the ground in hopes that they would back off.”

Then he called 911. Deputies from the Shenandoah County Sheriff’s Office arrived and arrested Mr. McCray, who was charged with brandishing a firearm, a misdemeanor.

According to Virginia law, it is legal for a person to brandish a weapon in “justifiable self-defense.” Mr. McCray later told his congregation that he had a license to carry a concealed weapon.

The Shenandoah County sheriff, Timothy C. Carter, issued a statement late last week in which he said he had spoken with Mr. McCray on June 3, two days after the incident, and apologized. He said the five people who confronted Mr. McCray had been taken into custody on various charges, including hate crimes.

Sheriff Carter also said that he had placed two supervisors in his department on administrative leave, and that he had asked the Shenandoah County Attorney’s Office to drop the brandishing charge against Mr. McCray.

“After talking with him about the incident, it was apparent to me that the charge of brandishing was certainly not appropriate,” Sheriff Carter wrote. “Actually, as I told Mr. McCray, if I were faced with similar circumstances, I would have probably done the same thing.”

In an interview on Wednesday, Sheriff Carter said he had ordered an internal review into the incident. More broadly, he said his department was taking a look at its own conduct and policies in light of the national unrest over police brutality that followed the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

“We’re learning a lot from our involvement in this incident, and we’re trying to learn and be better as we move through this,” he said.

Court documents show that Mr. McCray still faces the brandishing charge. On Tuesday, the Shenandoah County Commonwealth attorney, Amanda McDonald Wiseley, filed what is known as a nolle prosequi motion to dismiss the charge. If a judge approves the motion, prosecutors will still have the authority to charge Mr. McCray.

Mr. McCray’s lawyer, Chris Kowalczuk, said in an interview that he would prefer for the charge to be dismissed “with prejudice,” meaning prosecutors will not have the power to refile it.

“There’s a big difference in discontinuing a prosecution that can be brought back and a dismissal,” Mr. Kowalczuk said.

The Shenandoah County Commonwealth Attorney’s Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In his June 7 sermon, Mr. McCray reflected on how Mr. Floyd’s death in police custody in Minneapolis had “changed something” in the fight against police brutality in the United States and around the world.

“It shifted something in myself and probably many people alike,” he said. “This tragedy of unbelievable death has catapulted this country and the world with a clarion call for change that will not be denied.”"
"In California, Hanging Deaths of Two Black Men Summon a Dark History and F.B.I. Scrutiny","PALMDALE, Calif. — Poncitlan Square in the center of this high desert city is a tidy expanse of green lawn with a gazebo and a fountain. On one side is City Hall, on the other, a fire station. There is a cafe and the Whispering Palms Apartments. This time last year, for the first time, it was filled with revelers celebrating Juneteenth, the annual holiday to mark the end of slavery.

Today, it is a place of mourning, anger and suspicion after a black man was found dead in the park, in the early hours of the day, hanging from a tree.

Now, the grass around the Chinese Pistache tree is buried under balloons, candles, flowers and photographs of the man, Robert Fuller, one in his cap-and-gown, another with his sisters. A giant American flag flies overhead, as people gather around the tree, absorbed in despair for another black life lost.

The Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department first ruled the case a suicide. But it quickly shifted course by vowing a full investigation, a reaction in part to the protests, here and across the country, against police violence and racism.

“Black people don’t do that,” said Terry L. Scott, a realtor from Los Angeles, about an hour’s drive west, expressing a sentiment shared by many in Palmdale. “They don’t hang themselves from a tree in a public park.”

As tensions across the country grow in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, this desert region east of Los Angeles has been shaken not just by the death of Mr. Fuller but by a second, similar case, in nearby Victorville, where a black man was found dead, tied to a tree branch with a computer cord around his neck.

That case, too, was first considered a suicide, and officials in both cases say there is no sign of foul play. But now, in response to pleas from activists and family members, the local authorities are promising full investigations. And in a sign of the mistrust between the black community and law enforcement in the two cities, the F.B.I. is monitoring the inquiries, as are investigators with the state’s attorney general’s office.

Taken together, the cases highlight not only the moment America finds itself in but also the long and well-documented history in Southern California of racial discrimination, police abuses and the lingering presence of white supremacist groups.

Emotions were already raw over the killing of Mr. Floyd and the unrest it provoked, not to mention the accumulated grievances here over years of police abuses. Now, the potent symbolism of black men hanging from trees has put this city on edge — the atmosphere within the black community is a “powder keg,” one local pastor said — causing many to question law enforcement’s handling of the cases.

“I think it was a rush to judgment,” said Jamon R. Hicks, a Los Angeles civil rights lawyer hired by Mr. Fuller’s family who is working to arrange an independent autopsy. “What’s so disturbing about that is there’s this history they didn’t consider. My first thought would not be a suicide. My first thought is, this is a modern-day lynching.”

There have been at least three other hangings in public places in recent days that were ruled suicides, in Texas and New York City, sparking anguish and questions. A black teenager was found dead near an elementary school in Spring, Texas. A Hispanic man was found dead in Houston. And a black man was found dead in a tree in a Manhattan park.

Officials in all these cases said there was no evidence they were not suicides. Nevertheless, the deaths have drawn attention on social media, with activists expressing fears they could be signs of a backlash against the Black Lives Matter movement, and others calling for federal investigations.

In Northern California several nooses were found recently on five trees in a popular park in Oakland, prompting the F.B.I. to open a hate crimes investigation, even as some claimed the ropes were simply exercise equipment.

Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland said that the intent of whoever put the ropes in the trees will be relevant to the criminal investigation, while acknowledging the potent symbolism.

“What a privilege for those of us that don’t feel complete fear and terror when we see a rope in a tree,” she said at a news conference on Wednesday. “That is a privilege that so many of our African-American residents do not enjoy.”

In Victorville, a city 50 miles east of Palmdale in San Bernardino County, residents gathered this week to demand the police investigate the death of Malcolm Harsch, 38, a homeless man who was living in a tent when his body was found hanging from a tree on May 31, 10 days before Mr. Fuller’s death.

According to a social worker briefed on the investigation by the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department, Mr. Harsch’s body had no wounds to suggest he was attacked. The cable left one deep mark around his neck, typical of suicides, rather than several marks to indicate Mr. Harsch had struggled to free himself of the makeshift noose.

But many residents are angered that the police were quick to judge the death a suicide and did not perform an autopsy until 12 days after the body was found. And his death was not announced until nearly two weeks later, they say, only after media scrutiny of the death of Mr. Fuller was brought to light. In both cases, police have not made public any suicide notes.

The families of both Mr. Harsch and Mr. Fuller cast doubt that their loved ones’ deaths were suicides. But on Saturday, Mr. Harsch’s family said through a spokesman that after reviewing footage provided by the Victorville police, his death was, in fact, a suicide.

At a recent rally in Palmdale, Diamond Alexander, Mr. Fuller’s sister, who lives in Arizona, said, “my brother was not suicidal. He wasn’t.”

Karmen Smith, a mental health therapist, was so moved by the death of Mr. Fuller — who attended a local high school, loved basketball and was described as outgoing and funny — that she drove from Las Vegas to see the town square.

She said she could not believe a black man would hang himself on a tree in a public park, given the history in America of lynching.

When Ms. Smith walked into the park on Tuesday morning, she said, “I just screamed. I was just so outraged and saddened.”

Los Angeles County officials have now said they are searching for any video footage from the area around the park, and are analyzing the rope from Mr. Fuller’s case.

At the square in Palmdale, there is no escaping the backdrop of a nation at war with itself, as it grapples with a painful history. One man displayed old photographs of black men being lynched in America. Others spoke of the region’s own troubles — of housing discrimination, racial profiling, the presence of neo-Nazi groups, being taunted by racial slurs — and passed out fliers about the next-door town titled, “a brief overview of Lancaster’s racist history.”

The region was once predominantly white and expanded during World War II as the growing aerospace industry attracted families. In recent decades, the demographics have been shifting, as black and Latino residents fled Los Angeles in search of more affordable homes. This migration intensified racial tensions, residents say.

“I moved here 10 years ago from Compton,” said Aleka Jackson, 48, a teacher, who lives in Victorville. “I wanted to raise my children in a place that would be safer. But when you change location, you change your issues. I traded gang culture for racism.”

Many black and Latino residents who moved to the region were low-income, using housing vouchers from the federal Section 8 program.

This provoked an organized effort by the local authorities, in partnership with the Sheriff’s Department, to target low-income residents for eviction, according to federal investigators who found a pattern of abusive police practices against African-Americans in 2013. The investigation resulted in a consent decree and federal monitoring.

“I feel like black lives have remained vulnerable out here,” said Christian D. Green, a local pastor and adjunct professor of African-American history at several community colleges.

The day after Mr. Fuller was found dead, a sheriff’s deputy shot and killed a black man in his home in Lancaster following a domestic dispute. The sheriff’s department said the man, Michael Thomas, had reached for a deputy’s gun before being killed, a claim the man’s fiancée disputed, according to news reports.

Pastor Jacob D.R. Johnson of Growing Valley Baptist Church, a predominantly African-American congregation in Lancaster, said he hasn’t been able to bring himself to visit the park where Mr. Fuller was found dead. “I’ve had a hard time sleeping,” he said.

Mr. Johnson, the vice president of the local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., like other black leaders here, are preparing themselves for the possibility that Mr. Fuller was murdered, and what the reaction might be on the streets.

“We’re really saying, we’re not going to be quick to judge,” he said. “Wisdom cries out, wait.”

He is haunted by the racism in the region, whether it be painted swastikas popping up or, in a recent case that made news, a widely circulated photograph of teachers holding a noose.

“Hate crimes are not inconceivable,” he said.

Until there are answers, he added, “we are asking people to keep their families close.”

Questions Surround Police Killing of Latino Man in California,"Activists and family members of an 18-year-old Latino man are calling his death in Southern California this week an unjustified police killing.

The man, Andres Guardado, was fatally shot by a Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy in Gardena, Calif., after he “produced a firearm” and ran away from two deputies on Thursday night, the Sheriff’s Department said in a statement.

But it was unclear what led to the confrontation amid weeks of nationwide demonstrations denouncing police brutality and racism. About 20,000 people marched near the Hollywood Walk of Fame this month in a protest organized by Black Lives Matter.

[Sign up for California Today, our daily newsletter from the Golden State.]

Mr. Guardado was working two jobs as a security guard, and was studying to be a mechanic at Los Angeles Trade-Technical College, according to his uncle Noe Abarca. He was killed near an auto body shop that he was providing security for that day, Mr. Abarca said.

Mr. Guardado, whose family is from El Salvador, was dedicated to working and learning his trade, his uncle said. “He was always cheerful — I never saw him sad or angry,” Mr. Abarca said in Spanish. “He had gained the respect and the admiration of our whole family.”

“I haven’t slept in two days,” he added.

The Sheriff’s Department said that two deputies from the Compton Sheriff’s Station pursued Mr. Guardado on foot, and that one deputy fired six rounds, hitting him in the upper torso. Mr. Guardado was not wearing a security guard’s uniform, the department said, and a handgun without identifying marks or serial numbers was recovered at the scene.

The deputies were not wearing body cameras. The department was investigating whether nearby security cameras captured any video of the shooting, Capt. Kent Wegener said at a news conference on Saturday.

The police did not provide more details of the encounter or of the deputies involved.

It is difficult to tell how many Latinos are killed by the police because departments are not required to report consistently on race and ethnicity, said Eric Rodriguez, the senior vice president of policy and advocacy at UnidosUS, an advocacy group for Latinos.

But it is clear that a high percentage of Latinos fear that the police will use excessive force, Mr. Rodriguez said. “Something that is screaming out from the community is the feeling of being over-surveilled,” he said.

The Los Angeles Community College District released a statement supporting Mr. Guardado’s family and calling for a “full and independent investigation into the circumstances of the killing.”

“We must never be desensitized to, or normalized by, the alarming number of deaths by law enforcement of black and brown men and women in this country,” the district said.

On Saturday, Sheriff Alex Villanueva said it was premature to request an independent investigation by the attorney general.

Mr. Guardado and his father would often visit a restaurant owned by Mr. Abarca. But on Sunday — Father’s Day — his father, uncle and other relatives will be marching in a demonstration that begins at the site where Mr. Guardado was killed.

“We will be demanding justice,” Mr. Abarca said."
Shootings Test Viability of Seattle’s Protest ‘Autonomous Zone’,"SEATTLE — From the ice cream shop she runs in Seattle’s Capitol Hill neighborhood, Molly Moon Neitzel has watched as protesters have laid claim to the area’s streets over the past two weeks to demand racial justice.

The barricades and graffiti outside her storefront have carried messages that Ms. Neitzel embraces: Race equity, she says, is the top issue facing the city.

But a series of shootings have rocked the so-called Capitol Hill Organized Protest zone set up as an experiment in communal living, free of the police, in the area around Ms. Neitzel’s shop. Now, a memorial sits outside her shop for a 19-year-old man who died in the gunfire over the weekend.

“From my perspective, it’s time for the residents and organizers of CHOP to think about where they are going to go from here to effect policy change,” Ms. Neitzel said on Monday, as Mayor Jenny Durkan tried and failed to broker an end to the standoff with protest leaders. “I don’t think that policy change is going to happen only in the middle of Pine Street.”

The violence over the past few days — a total of four people shot — has rattled a neighborhood that until now had largely enjoyed a festival-like atmosphere after officers boarded up and abandoned the city’s East Precinct station and left several blocks of the city to police themselves.

“Black Lives Matter” was painted down a full block of Pine Street, one of the city’s main thoroughfares. A banner hung from the boarded-up police station declaring that the building was now “property of the Seattle people.”

After the weekend shootings, the crowds milling through the zone on Monday were much smaller than on previous days, and people were openly talking about what to do next.

Until now, the city has given tacit approval for the protest zone to continue, helping reorganize barriers and provide logistics such as portable toilets.

Protesters have used the scene to hold speeches and movie nights on streets with artwork and memorials to those who have died at the hands of the police. On Monday, some continued to sit on couches and chat at the Decolonization Conversation Cafe.

But in the wake of the violence, Ms. Durkan’s spokeswoman said that city leaders have been reaching out to some of the organizers to find a peaceful resolution.

That effort was led in part by Andre Taylor, who has been outspoken against police violence since his brother, Che, was fatally shot by Seattle police during an arrest in 2016. Mr. Taylor said he had encouraged various leaders in the protest zone to come to the table to talk about a different path forward. He was hopeful they would meet with the mayor on Monday. That did not materialize, and Mr. Taylor expressed some sympathy for the situation in which city officials find themselves.

“If you put yourself in the shoes of anyone in authority that has to care for the well-being of its people, you can’t allow killings and shootings to happen on a daily basis,” Mr. Taylor said. “You can’t do it. I wouldn’t do it.”

But the protesters, with an uncertain leadership structure, have had various goals. Some activists have called for focusing on a few key demands, such as defunding the Police Department, while others have talked about larger problems, such as economic inequality, or more specific issues, such as whether the boarded-up police station could become a community center.

Among those who have led efforts in the CHOP is Raz Simone, a musician. He said on Twitter that the police could come and go through the zone as they please but he did not respond to a message seeking comment.

Ms. Durkan had indicated that she was open to allowing the protests to continue through the summer. But she said in a news conference on Monday night that “it is time for people to go home.”

Ms. Durkan said she did not have a deadline for people to disperse but said the city would be working with partners to clear out the area. Carmen Best, the chief of police, said officers needed to get back into the police station they left behind.

The first shooting at the zone occurred early Saturday morning. John Moore, a medic working at the scene, said it began with a series of confrontations among people in the crowd. He treated the 19-year-old who was shot and then transported him to a hospital before he was pronounced dead. A 33-year-old man was also shot nearby.

Mr. Moore said he was upset that the Fire Department had not entered the zone to help with the man who died. Fire Department officials said they had been following procedure and waiting for the Police Department to secure the area first. Police officers had taken time to stage outside of the zone and, when they did enter, they encountered hostility from people who said the victim had already been removed from the scene.

The second shooting occurred late Sunday night. A 17-year-old boy who was shot was treated at Harborview Medical Center and released, a spokeswoman for the hospital said.

Then on Tuesday, the police said they were investigating yet another shooting in the early morning hours near the protest zone, with one person injured.

No suspects have been publicly identified in the cases, and the Police Department said it was looking for witnesses to help piece together what happened.

Teri McClain, who was at the protest zone on Monday, said the zone had given people a place to have a platform and to mobilize. But given the latest violence, she said, she would not object if the protest came to an end. She said she was hopeful that the people who gathered there were ready to continue taking action in other ways.

Part of the challenge, Ms. McClain said, was that there are various groups and interests in the zone. Some of those there are simply homeless, or are there to party or cause trouble, she said, and the ones who are there for social justice reasons have different goals and agendas.

“You can’t walk in here and say, ‘Excuse me, where’s the office of the person in charge?’” Ms. McClain said. “There’s all these different groups working on different things in different places.”

Along with Black Lives Matter activists, the zone has included a variety of people talking about larger social issues. Kshama Sawant, a member of the City Council, led protesters in a demonstration calling for new taxes on Amazon, which is headquartered in the city.

Gerald Hankerson, the president of the N.A.A.C.P.’s Alaska-Oregon-Washington State Conference, an organization that has been an active player in race issues in the region for years, said his group had been mainly on the periphery of the CHOP effort.

Mr. Hankerson said he appreciated how the protesters have kept the issue of the unjust treatment of African-Americans by the police at the forefront of discussions, but wondered whether the emphasis on holding several blocks on Capitol Hill would prevent the police from killing black people.

“While some may consider this a victory,” he said, “it’s only a battle in a much larger war.”"
House Passes Sweeping Policing Bill Targeting Racial Bias and Use of Force,"WASHINGTON — The House on Thursday passed an expansive policing overhaul bill aimed at combating racial discrimination and excessive use of force in law enforcement, as Democrats sought to respond to a nationwide outcry for racial justice and pushed through legislation that is doomed in the Republican-controlled Senate.

The bipartisan vote was 236-181 to approve the measure, the most sweeping federal intervention into law enforcement in years. It would eliminate legal protections that shield police officers from lawsuits, make it easier to prosecute them for wrongdoing, impose a new set of restrictions on the use of deadly force, and effectively ban the use of chokeholds.

But passage of the legislation, introduced as a response to the killings of black Americans across the country and a wave of protests that have followed, only underscored the depth of the stalemate in Congress over how to bring about law enforcement changes that both parties say are needed. Republicans have said the bill is a federal overreach into policing that will never pass the Senate, and the White House has threatened a veto.

Its approval came the day after Senate Democrats blocked a Republican effort to advance a much narrower bill that would encourage police departments to revise their practices, but not mandate any changes. That move all but extinguished the hope that Congress will be able to pass legislation this year addressing systemic racism in law enforcement, almost certainly shifting the debate over race and policing to the campaign trail, where the two parties will blame each other for the demise of the effort.

Still on Thursday, Democrats called the passage of their bill an important message at a time of upheaval over the treatment of black Americans by the police. Speaking from the Capitol steps, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday that the vote would serve as a pledge to the American public: “Never again.”

“Exactly one month ago, George Floyd spoke his final words, ‘I can’t breathe,’ and changed the course of history,” Ms. Pelosi said. “The House is honoring his life and the lives of all killed by police brutality.”

Three moderate Republicans joined a united bloc of Democrats — including those facing difficult re-election fights in conservative-leaning districts — to support the legislation. The vote underscored just how quickly the politics of law enforcement have shifted during an election year amid a groundswell of public support for significant changes to the way that the police operate. Representatives Fred Upton of Michigan, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, and Will Hurd of Texas, the only African-American Republican in the chamber, voted in support of the bill.

“With the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and far too many others, there was no doubt in my mind — or that of most Americans — that we needed to act,” said Representative Max Rose, Democrat of New York. “Once again, we saw that black Americans, and other communities of color, are not equal in the eyes of too many criminal justice systems around the country. This bill has the potential to change that.”

Democrats’ legislation, spearheaded by Representative Karen Bass of California, the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, included several measures that civil rights activists have been pushing for decades, such as amending the federal criminal code to make it easier to prosecute police officers for misconduct by lowering the standard that prosecutors must meet.

Over 100 civil rights groups endorsed the legislation, as did some families of black Americans killed by the police, including Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died in 2014 after an officer put him in a chokehold, and Samaria Rice, the mother of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy who was shot for carrying a toy gun.

“From banning chokeholds to eliminating no-knock warrants, this bill will hold officers accountable to the communities they serve and compel them to have a guardian mentality, not a warrior mentality,” the families said in a statement. “In the valiant pursuit of justice, this is a strong step in the right direction.”

The bill would also create a national registry to track police misconduct and require law enforcement agencies to report data on the use of force, aim to force departments to eliminate the use of chokeholds, and condition some federal grants on the adoption of anti-discrimination training and practices.

Law enforcement organizations and police unions forcefully opposed it, mounting a successful effort to dissuade the White House and Senate Republicans from embracing the most stringent requirements and restrictions.

Hours before the vote, the White House issued an official threat to veto the measure, calling it “overbroad” and arguing that it would “deter good people from pursuing careers in law enforcement” and “weaken the ability of law enforcement agencies to reduce crime.”

Over two weeks ago, as protesters thronged streets in big cities and small towns across the nation, many lawmakers on Capitol Hill hoped that they would be able to bridge a previously insurmountable gulf on police reform efforts and pass legislation addressing systemic racism in law enforcement. Those hopes have rapidly fizzled, replaced by bitter recriminations after Senate Democrats refused on Wednesday even to allow the Republican bill to come up for debate, calling it “woefully inadequate.”

The move left Republicans apoplectic and charging that Democrats had blocked the legislation for political gain. Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader, told reporters on Thursday that he had reached out to Democrats “explaining that I wanted to make law, I wanted to work together.”

On the other side of the Capitol, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, chided Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, for his tone during the debate, charging that he had been disrespectful to Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the sponsor of the Republican bill and the only black senator in the party.

“I didn’t see why the Democratic leader talks right past Senator Scott as if he were not leading this discussion, as if he were barely here,” Mr. McConnell said on the floor. “All I can say is that it was jarring to witness.”

In fact in his remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Schumer called Mr. Scott “greatly respected” and asked Mr. McConnell to have the South Carolina Republican lead a bipartisan effort to negotiate a new, more expansive Senate policing bill. Republicans rejected that entreaty, and Democrats moved to block their bill.

Ms. Pelosi endorsed the decision to block the Republican bill, saying it did not contain “anything they could vote for.”

“You all gave them so much credit for a bill that did nothing and then expected us to embrace it,” she told reporters. “No way. They did the right thing.”

Both Republicans and Democrats have insisted that the opportunity to revive policing reform efforts has not been foreclosed. But given the partisan gridlock, and with lawmakers in both chambers expected to be out of Washington for extended periods of time leading up to the November election, many of them privately concede that a compromise will be difficult to strike.

Joseph R. Biden Jr. has taken a commanding lead over President Trump in the 2020 race, building a wide advantage among women and nonwhite voters and making deep inroads with some traditionally Republican-leaning groups that have shifted away from Mr. Trump following his ineffective response to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new national poll of registered voters by The New York Times and Siena College.

Mr. Biden is currently ahead of Mr. Trump by 14 percentage points, garnering 50 percent of the vote compared with 36 percent for Mr. Trump. That is among the most dismal showings of Mr. Trump’s presidency, and a sign that he is the clear underdog right now in his fight for a second term.

Mr. Trump has been an unpopular president for virtually his entire time in office. He has made few efforts since his election in 2016 to broaden his support beyond the right-wing base that vaulted him into office with only 46 percent of the popular vote and a modest victory in the Electoral College.

But among a striking cross-section of voters, the distaste for Mr. Trump has deepened as his administration failed to stop a deadly disease that crippled the economy and then as he responded to a wave of racial-justice protests with angry bluster and militaristic threats. The dominant picture that emerges from the poll is of a country ready to reject a president whom a strong majority of voters regard as failing the greatest tests confronting his administration.

Mr. Biden leads Mr. Trump by enormous margins with black and Hispanic voters, and women and young people appear on track to choose Mr. Biden by an even wider margin than they favored Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump in 2016. But the former vice president has also drawn even with Mr. Trump among male voters, whites and people in middle age and older — groups that have typically been the backbones of Republican electoral success, including Mr. Trump’s in 2016.

Arlene Myles, 75, of Denver, said she had been a Republican for nearly six decades before switching her registration to independent earlier this year during Mr. Trump’s impeachment trial. Ms. Myles said that when Mr. Trump was first elected, she had resolved to “give him a chance,” but had since concluded that he and his party were irredeemable.

“I was one of those people who stuck by Nixon until he was waving goodbye,” Ms. Myles said. “I thought I was a good Republican and thought they had my values, but they have gone down the tubes these last few years.”

Ms. Myles said she planned to vote for Mr. Biden, expressing only one misgiving: “I wish he was younger,” she said.

Most stark may be Mr. Biden’s towering advantage among white women with college degrees, who support him over Mr. Trump by 39 percentage points. In 2016, exit polls found that group preferred Mrs. Clinton to Mr. Trump by just 7 percentage points. The poll also found that Mr. Biden has narrowed Mr. Trump’s advantage with less-educated white voters.

The exodus of white voters from the G.O.P. has been especially pronounced among younger voters, an ominous trend for a party that was already heavily reliant on older Americans.

Fifty-two percent of whites under 45 said they supported Mr. Biden while only 30 percent said they supported Mr. Trump. And their opposition is intense: More than twice as many younger whites viewed the president very unfavorably than very favorably.

Tom Diamond, 31, a Republican in Fort Worth, Texas, said he planned to vote for Mr. Trump but would do so with real misgivings. He called the president a “poor leader” who had mishandled the pandemic and said Mr. Biden seemed “like a guy you can trust.” But Mr. Trump held views closer to his own on the economy, health care and abortion.

“Part of you just feels icky voting for him,” Mr. Diamond said. “But definitely from a policy perspective, that’s where my vote’s going to go.”

Some unease toward Mr. Trump stems from voters’ racial attitudes. According to the poll, white voters under 45 are overwhelmingly supportive of the Black Lives Matter movement, while older whites are more tepid in their views toward racial justice activism. And nearly 70 percent of whites under 45 said they believed the killing of George Floyd was part of a broader pattern of excessive police violence toward African-Americans rather than an isolated incident.

What’s striking, though, is that even among white seniors, one of Mr. Trump’s strongest constituencies, he has damaged himself with his conduct. About two-fifths of whites over 65 said they disapproved of Mr. Trump’s handling of both the coronavirus and race relations.

Mr. Trump retains a few points of strength in the poll that could offer him a way to regain a footing in the race, and the feeble condition of his candidacy right now may well represent his low point in a campaign with four and a half months still to go. In 2016, Mr. Trump often trailed Mrs. Clinton in national polls by slimmer margins, and ultimately overcame her lead in the popular vote with razor-thin victories in key swing states.

His approval rating is still narrowly positive on the issue of the economy, with 50 percent of voters giving him favorable marks compared with 45 percent saying the opposite. Should the fall campaign become a referendum on which candidate is better equipped to restore prosperity after the pandemic has subsided, that could give Mr. Trump a new opening to press his case.

The president is also still ahead of Mr. Biden among white voters without college degrees, who hold disproportionate influence in presidential elections because of how central the Midwest is to capturing 270 electoral votes.

Yet if Mr. Trump still has a significant measure of credibility with voters on the economy, he lacks any apparent political strength on the most urgent issues of the moment: the pandemic and the national reckoning on policing and race.

Nearly three-fifths of voters disapprove of Mr. Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, including majorities of white voters and men. Self-described moderate voters disapproved of Mr. Trump on the coronavirus by a margin of more than two to one.

Most of the country is also rejecting Mr. Trump’s call to reopen the economy as quickly as possible, even at the cost of exposing people to greater health risks. By a 21-point margin, voters said the federal government should prioritize containing the coronavirus, even if it hurts the economy, a view that aligns them with Mr. Biden.

Just a third of voters said the government should focus on restarting the economy even if that entails greater public-health risks.

That debate could become the central focus of the campaign in the coming weeks, as coronavirus outbreaks grow rapidly in a number of Republican-led states that have resisted the strict lockdown measures imposed in the spring by Democratic states like New York and California.

The public also does not share Mr. Trump’s resistance to mask wearing. The president has declined to don a mask in nearly all public appearances, even as top health officials in his administration have urged Americans to do so as a precaution against spreading the coronavirus. In the poll, 54 percent of people said they always wear a mask when they expect to be in proximity to other people, while another 22 percent said they usually wear a mask.

Just 22 percent said they rarely or never wear a mask.

Mr. Trump’s job approval on race relations was just as dismal. Sixty-one percent of voters said they disapproved of Mr. Trump’s handling of race, versus 33 percent who said they approved. By a similar margin, voters said they disapproved of his response to the protests after the death of Mr. Floyd.

Mr. Trump has sought several times in the last month to use demonstrations against the police as a political wedge issue, forcing Democrats to align themselves squarely either with law-enforcement agencies or with the most strident anti-police demonstrators.

The poll suggested most voters were rejecting that binary choice, as well as Mr. Trump’s harsh characterization of protesters: Large majorities said they had a positive overall assessment of both the Black Lives Matter movement and the police.

The picture of Mr. Biden that emerges from the poll is one of a broadly acceptable candidate who inspires relatively few strong feelings in either direction. He is seen favorably by about half of voters and unfavorably by 42 percent. Only a quarter said they saw him very favorably, equaling the share that sees him in very negative terms.

Mr. Trump, by contrast, is seen very favorably by 27 percent of voters and very unfavorably by 50 percent.

Harry Hoyt, 72, of York County in Southern Maine, said he has sometimes voted for Republican presidential candidates in the past and cast a grudging vote for Mrs. Clinton in 2016. He felt better this time about his plan to vote for Mr. Biden.

“Biden would be a better candidate than Trump, simply because he’s a nice person,” Mr. Hoyt said. “One of the most important things to me is the character of the man in charge of our country.”

Significantly, one group that saw Mr. Biden as far more than just acceptable was black voters. Fifty-six percent of black respondents in the poll said they saw Mr. Biden very favorably, a far more enthusiastic judgment than from any other constituency.

The limited passion for Mr. Biden among other Democratic constituencies does not appear to be affecting his position against Mr. Trump. Though only 13 percent of people under 30 said they had a very favorable opinion of the former vice president, that group is backing Mr. Biden over Mr. Trump by 34 percentage points.

Nicholas Angelos, a 20-year-old voter in Bloomington, Ind., who said he supported Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries, said he would vote for Mr. Biden as the “lesser of two evils.” He said he believed the former vice president would “try his best,” in contrast to Mr. Trump, whom he described as “an autocrat” and “anti-science.”

“We all have to compromise,” said Mr. Angelos, who described himself as very liberal. He added of Mr. Biden, “I don’t think he’s anything special.”

For the moment, voters also appear unpersuaded by one of the primary attack lines Mr. Trump and his party have used against Mr. Biden: the claim that, at age 77, he is simply too old for the presidency. Mr. Trump, 74, has mocked Mr. Biden’s mental acuity frequently over the last few months and his campaign has run television advertisements that cast Mr. Biden as absent-minded and inarticulate.

But whatever reservations voters may have about Mr. Biden’s age, three in five said they disagreed with the claim that he was too old to be an effective president. The percentage of voters who agreed, 36 percent, exactly matched Mr. Trump’s existing support in the presidential race.

Lindsay Clark, 37, who lives in the suburbs of Salt Lake City, was among the voters who said she would probably vote for Mr. Trump because she was unsure Mr. Biden was “physically and mentally up to the task” of being president. But Ms. Clark expressed little admiration for Mr. Trump, whom she called unpresidential.

Ms. Clark, who voted for a third-party candidate in 2016, said she was hard-pressed to name something she really liked about Mr. Trump, eventually settling on the idea that he expressed himself bluntly.

“I was just trying to think if I could think of something off the top of my head that I was like, ‘Yes, I loved when you did that!’” she said of Mr. Trump. “And I kind of just can’t.”

transcript

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

Today: This fall’s presidential race is likely to be decided by a handful of battleground states won by President Trump in 2016. Nate Cohn on what a major new poll from The New York Times found about how voters in those states view the president and his Democratic rival.

It’s Thursday, June 25.

Nate, the last time we talked about polling in the presidential race, it was still the Democratic primary. It was back in November. And the polling that you all did showed that no matter which Democrat Donald Trump would face, he was doing OK.

Yeah. The polls showed that Donald Trump was pretty competitive. He was in a close race against all of his major Democratic rivals. He wasn’t always ahead. He was losing to Joe Biden, for instance. But he was in a pretty good and highly competitive spot, even at a moment where he was facing imminent prospect of impeachment in the House of Representatives. And so after all of that, for him still to be so close, it sure seemed like he was in a pretty decent position, all considered.

So what was your thinking going into this next big poll that you all just finished?

Well, I did not think that Donald Trump would be doing quite as well as he had done in October. And there have been a lot of polls over the last couple of months indicating that Joe Biden has had a gradually building lead, both nationwide and in the battleground states. But given that we had such good results for the president in the past, I thought there was a pretty distinct possibility that we would show a race that was, you know, even if not extremely close, still competitive.

And what happened once this polling got underway?

Well, we get the results back every morning from the last night of interviews. And from the start, it was pretty clear that this was a very different set of polling data.

The first morning’s numbers were really bad for Trump. And you know, it’s something you try not to pay any attention to. It’s just one day of interviews, and the numbers change a lot. But you know, the next morning, and the next morning after that, it was bad again. And in the end, we polled for 14 days. And for all 14, the numbers were bad for the president. And they never got better.

And just how bad?

Really bad. We did seven different polls. We have a national survey that showed Joe Biden leading by 14 points, 50 to 36 percent.

Wow.

We have six battleground state polls. These are the six states that Donald Trump won in 2016, but that were most closely fought last time — Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina. And here again, Joe Biden had a considerable lead. He was up 9 percentage points across those six states, including a lead of at least six points in every one of them.

Wow. So that is legitimately, seriously bad polling data for the incumbent President, Donald Trump?

Yeah. I mean, if you look back historically, it is really hard to find an example of an incumbent president sitting in such a bad position heading into re-election. It’s worse than Jimmy Carter in 1980 at this stage, or even in the final polls, for instance.

Huh.

There’s just not much for the president to hang his hat on here.

So let’s talk about what the battleground state polls show, specifically about why voters seem to be souring on President Trump. What’s the story that the data from these battleground state polls tell you about why that is?

The polls tell a really simple story. They say that voters across the battleground states have concluded that the president has failed to meet the most important crises of our political moment. They think he’s failed on the coronavirus. They think he’s failed on race relations. And they think he’s failed in the protests, and so on. And as a result, there has been a rebellion among white voters in the battleground states, the very voters that four years ago were responsible for the president’s persistent strength in these states.

So before we get to the revolt of these white voters, which seems very important, let’s talk about these issues that voters do not think the president has properly managed and maybe go through a few of them, one by one.

I think it’s worth just breaking them down into two groups. One is the coronavirus. Voters disapprove of the way he’s handled it by a wide margin. 56 percent of voters in the battleground states say they disapprove, includes a significant number of people who voted for him in 2016. And it’s not just that they take issue with the president’s effectiveness. There’s an underlying disagreement between the president and the electorate about priorities.

What do you mean?

So we asked voters whether they thought the federal government’s priority should be to limit the spread of the coronavirus, even if it hurts the economy. Or if they think the federal government’s priority should be to restart the economy, even if it increases the risk to public health. And voters in the battleground states said, by a 20-plus point margin, that they thought the priority ought to be to limit the spread of the coronavirus. And incredibly, that even includes the people who have lost their jobs as a result of the coronavirus over the last few months.

I want to pause on this. Because this seems really fascinating. By 20 percent, voters favor conquering the virus over reopening the American economy. Because that is the complete opposite of the message from the president.

It’s the complete opposite. And it really goes against so much of what we usually assume about American politics, right? It’s the economy, stupid. But here we have a rare issue where voters very explicitly are prioritizing something else. I can’t think of another comparison for it except war.

Hm.

You know? In World War II, it’s not like if you had asked voters, what should be the priority, you know, helping the economy or beating the Japanese, that they would be like, oh, it’s the economy, stupid.

Right. You’re saying with lives on the line, voters are telling us in this poll that the economy takes something of a backseat.

That’s right.

What seems interesting is that the president is banking on an economic recovery, or goodwill over his management of the economy prior to the pandemic, to win re-election. But it sounds like from what you’re saying, that wouldn’t necessarily give him a boost, because voters are not prioritizing the economy the way they usually do.

Yeah. I mean, he’s right to think that’s his advantage. I mean, astonishingly, given the overall economic numbers, voters in the battleground states say they approve of the president’s handling of the economy, by a 15-point margin. That’s a —

Wow.

— what, 30 points different than his overall approval rating? And the reason for that disconnect is just fundamental and simple. The coronavirus is more important. And they may appreciate what he’s done on the economy. But in this case, emphasizing the economy isn’t what they’re looking for.

So what about the second big issue that you said voters disapprove of the president’s management of, which is race and the protests over race and policing?

Right. Just a whole spectrum of different issues relating to race and criminal justice and the protests, the president’s ratings are even worse on those issues than they are on the coronavirus. And here again, the president has this fundamental disconnect with the electorate, where his priorities aren’t the same as theirs. I mean, we asked whether they would rather have a candidate who says that we need to be tough on protests that go too far, or whether they would rather have a candidate who says we need to focus on the cause of protests, even when they go too far. And voters said, by a 40-point margin, that they would rather have the candidate who focuses on the cause of the protests, even when they’re going too far. And it’s also including a significant number of people who backed the president.

So the gulf between how the president is talking about these protests and how voters across the battleground states are thinking about these protests is enormous.

Yeah. And I wouldn’t have guessed that, personally.

So Nate, how does this disapproval of how the president’s handling these major crises, how does that explain this concept you touched on earlier of white voters revolting against the President?

Well, a pretty significant number of white voters in the battleground states do not side with the president, either his handling of the coronavirus or on these racial issues. And these are now the issues that are most important in the minds of voters in the battleground states. And so while maybe in 2016, a lot of these voters were focused on who would do the best on trade or immigration, now what’s on their mind is who is the best job handling protests and coronavirus. They’re not so sure they want to vote for the President anymore. In our poll, nearly 15 percent of the people who say they voted for President Trump in 2016 aren’t willing to say they support him against Joe Biden. And 7 percent of those voters say there’s almost no chance they’ll vote for him again.

So 7 percent of his base plans on flipping, and 15 percent is very open to flipping, because of the way he has handled all of these complex questions over the past few months or year?

Yeah. And I should note they may not necessarily flip. They could vote third party. They could stay home. They have other options here. But a meaningful number of them at the moment say they would back Joe Biden for president.

Wow.

So at the moment, the president’s coalition, this core base of support among white voters that got him to victory in 2016, just is not there for him anymore. It has suffered serious defections, mainly at its periphery, you know, not the people wearing MAGA hats. But the sort of people who voted for Obama in 2012, backed Donald Trump in 2016 because they liked what he had to say about illegal immigration and trade, are not putting up with him right now.

And who is this voter, this white voter who is now turning on the president four years later?

It’s a pretty broad group of white voters. It includes college-educated white voters. It includes white voters without a college degree. It includes young voters. Young white voters now back Joe Biden by 20 points.

Wow.

It includes older white voters. At the moment, the president is losing among seniors, who were the bedrock of his support in 2016.

Wow. You know, Nate, I’m curious if there’s a prototypical swing state region that you think of as being illustrative of everything that you’re describing here, this alienation, this disapproval of the way the president is handling everything since we last polled these battleground states.

Well, I could indulge you on that question. I could tell you about how in the Green Bay region of Wisconsin or in Northeast Pennsylvania or something that Joe Biden is now ahead, and Donald Trump won there big in 2016. But you know, frankly, it’s true everywhere. There are no exceptions here. There’s no place where the president’s holding up fairly well and I can be like, that’s the place where it’s particularly bad. There’s no region that epitomizes this more than any other. I could choose anywhere and tell you that the president appears to be losing ground among white voters. It’s true in the battleground states. It’s true nationally. It’s true everywhere.

We’ll be right back.

OK. Nate, let’s talk about what these polls, both the national poll, but especially the six battleground state polls, have told us about Joe Biden and why he seems to be leading so handsomely over Donald Trump.

You know, my honest answer is that I think our answers on Joe Biden are kind of boring.

Boring how?

You know, the voters, they like Joe Biden. He’s got a 50 percent favorability rating. It’s fine. They don’t seem to have a very strong opinion of him either way. They do think he would do a better job than Trump on almost every issue, except the economy and China. But there’s not a groundswelling of support for him. And there’s not particularly deep opposition to him either. Instead, 55 percent of voters say there is at least some chance they would vote for him. So that to me indicates that a pretty broad swath of the electorate is at least considering the guy at this stage.

Hm. And what you’re describing is an alternative, rather than a charismatic figure that voters are looking to with great ardor.

I think that’s right. A lot of the divides that you might think about in American politics today, like between young and old, and so on. They don’t really even exist on Joe Biden. Everyone just kind of has a modestly favorable view of him. And there are many circumstances in which maybe that’s not the exact candidate you’d want to run for president. But it may be exactly the right candidate at a time when a clear majority of the electorate has resolved that it does not want to reelect the current president.

Nate, you’re painting a scenario in which Joe Biden seems to be thriving as a reflection of President Trump’s weakness. And that’s a familiar concept in presidential campaigns. But I went through the battleground state poll that you sent me about 24 hours ago. And I was really struck by the number of issues on which respondents to the poll said they thought that Joe Biden would do a better job than President Trump. It was immigration. It was protests. It was the pandemic. And so how do we know whether that is a reflection of President Trump, or a true sense that people believe Joe Biden is inherently the best person to do those things?

You know, it’s a great question. Unfortunately, the way that we’ve asked this question to voters, I don’t think we can disentangle whether they think Joe Biden would be good versus believing that Donald Trump is bad. We’re just asking voters whether they think Joe Biden would do a better job than Donald Trump. And so I don’t think we can pull out the varying effects of Joe Biden and Donald Trump on that. I do think, though, that one thing that stands out to me is how much the results of those questions matches up with Trump’s approval rating on those issues, which at least to me implies that it’s more about the president than it is about Joe Biden.

Hm. In other words, disapproval of the president is kind of mirrored in the data of approval or the belief that Joe Biden would do something better?

That’s right.

This data clearly suggests there’s not a tremendous amount of passion around Joe Biden. And yet, he’s developed this very significant lead over President Trump. And so I wonder whether that means that the electability case for Joe Biden, which was debated endlessly throughout the primary, has kind of proven to be exactly what Joe Biden and the people around him said it would be now that there’s a two person race, Biden versus Trump.

Well, I don’t think we can run the counterfactual and see whether Elizabeth Warren would be leading today if she had been the Democratic nominee or Bernie Sanders. What I think we can say is that the case for Joe Biden’s electability is playing out here. The case for Joe Biden’s electability was always that a sufficient number of voters do not want to re-elect the president, so choose someone who maximizes the appeal of the Democratic candidate with the broadest number of voters. I don’t know whether that means that a different candidate would be doing better or worse than Joe Biden. But what we do know is that Joe Biden is up nine points across battleground states that voted for Trump last time. He’s up 14 points nationwide. And he would have a distinct chance of winning by the widest margin of any candidate in my lifetime.

Well, Nate, that leads me to a very important and delicate question that involves you and me. Because four years ago, we were having a conversation about polling. And Donald Trump was down in those polls. I was the host of a different show called “The Run Up.” You were the first guest on the first episode. And the title of that episode was, “Could Hillary Clinton Win in a Landslide?” So I think you know where this question is now headed.

How could I not?

So what is different about this lead, if anything, that makes you and should make us trust it?

Well, I think we should all approach this with a lot of humility. I mean, polling is tough the day before the election. It’s really tough five months before the election. The national environment has changed a lot in the last five months. It can change a lot in the next five months. That said, I think that this lead is different from Hillary Clinton’s lead. It doesn’t mean that Donald Trump can’t win. But it is different. It’s different in two ways. One, it’s a wider lead. Joe Biden is up by more. If the polls were just as wrong as they were in 2016, and the election were held tomorrow, Joe Biden would still win. I mean, the polls could be more wrong. There’s no law of polling that says that 2016 is the worst case scenario or something. But this is a bigger advantage than Hillary Clinton had down the final stretch. It’s a more persistent advantage. And it’s wider than even her peaks. The second difference is a methodological one, which is that we are much more focused on the battleground states this time than we were in 2016. In 2016, we had really good national polling. And we did not have very much good polling in the battleground states. We have resolved to flip that around, to try and deal with the things that went wrong four years ago. None of that ensures that our results will be perfect if the election were held tomorrow. But it is a reason why it is less likely that these polls would be fundamentally wrong in the same way that so many state polls were fundamentally wrong four years ago.

A key caveat, however, seems to be that the lead that Joe Biden has developed over these past few months has occurred when he has been largely invisible. Right? I mean, this has been a very unusual campaign in the sense that the President is as visible as he’s ever been, every day — at the White House, on Twitter and now campaign rallies. Whereas Joe Biden has been largely quarantined and kind of offstage. Inevitably, that will change. And I wonder how much that could begin to alter some of the dynamics of these polls.

I think that it absolutely could begin to help narrow the race. And this was the pattern in 2016, by the way. There were these moments of the race when the talk was always about Donald Trump. And he would get in these fights. The news would be all about how Donald Trump said this ridiculous stuff. All these Republicans would be criticizing him. And then Hillary Clinton would have this lead. And then two weeks later, something would happen, when it was her emails, or the “deplorables” line, or random health scares, and so on. And Hillary Clinton’s lead would fall right back down to a more competitive race. And I think it is certainly possible that if voters focus as much on Joe Biden at any point in this election cycle as they focused on Hillary Clinton, that would probably lead to a tighter race than the one we have now.



Perhaps put more simply, what you’re saying is that campaigning in absentia, essentially, is working for Joe Biden. And it’s working pretty well.

Absolutely. I mean, the fundamentals of the race right now are that Donald Trump is really unpopular. Donald Trump is the defining feature of the race. That adds up to a big win for Joe Biden right now. If that formulation changes, and Joe Biden is just as important in the minds of voters as Donald Trump, maybe Joe Biden’s lead would shrink a lot. Maybe it would shrink a little. I don’t know. But what I can say is that this particular dynamic is working out really well for Joe Biden.

Nate, thank you very much. And I want to warn you that we are going to be doing this a lot for the next five months, but not too much.

Thank you for having me. And I am looking forward to it.

We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today.

Good afternoon. Today the Sun County grand jury did return an indictment against Travis McMichael, Greg McMichael and William Bryant.

On Wednesday, four months after a 25-year-old black man, Ahmaud Arbery, was chased down and killed while jogging in South Georgia, three white men were indicted on charges ranging from malice murder to false imprisonment.

This is another positive step, another great step for finding justice for Ahmaud, for finding justice for this family and the community beyond.

Local police were slow to arrest and charge the three men, prompting the first in a series of public protests in the past few months over the extrajudicial killing of black Americans. And the U.S. recorded nearly 37,000 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday, the highest single-day total since the pandemic began. With infections rising so quickly, the City of Houston said it was running out of intensive care beds. The governor of Texas urged residents to stay inside. And Washington and North Carolina said they would require that masks be worn in public.

We’re going to have a quarantine on visitors from those states that have a positivity rate north of 10 percent over a seven day moving average. So it could change a little bit over time. Hopefully, those states that are so grave — Florida, Texas, Arizona — will come back with a lower infection rate.

In the Northeast, where infection rates have declined, the governors of three neighboring states — New York, New Jersey and Connecticut — said they would require a two-week quarantine for travelers coming from states where cases are surging.

What that means in terms of quarantine will be enforced differently in different states. What we want to do here in the state of Connecticut is one, if you come up from those states and you haven’t tested, and you haven’t had a negative test, you’re coming up here, you’ve got to quarantine for 14 days.

That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.

We asked thousands of voters across the country about President Trump, Joseph R. Biden Jr., the coronavirus pandemic, Black Lives Matter and more.

Mississippi Lawmakers Push Ahead With Proposal to Take Down State Flag,"Update: In a ceremony on Tuesday evening, Gov. Tate Reeves of Mississippi signed into law the legislation replacing the state flag.

JACKSON, Miss. — A flag stamped with a defiant tribute to Mississippi’s Confederate past has been raised on the grounds of the State Capitol for well over a century.

It flew when the Civil War was not yet distant history and when segregation was fiercely enforced by law. Through the fight for civil rights and after remnants of the Confederacy were toppled elsewhere in moments of inflamed racial tension, the flag endured.

But on Saturday, as the state flag embedded with the blue bars and white stars of the Confederate battle flag flapped from its pole in front of the Capitol, lawmakers gathered inside to wrestle over whether to retire it to history.

Both chambers of the Republican-led Legislature voted, with the support of supermajorities, to push ahead with legislation that would remove the flag and lay the framework for replacing it.

The debate among lawmakers and across the state has been laced with passion, weighted by the generations of pride and pain the flag has long represented. It was in many ways a familiar discussion, one rehashed through decades of disagreement.

Yet as the flag was swept up in the broader convulsions over racial history that were unleashed by the death of George Floyd in the custody of the Minneapolis police, there was a growing sense that this time was different.

The flag, the only state banner left in the country with an overt Confederate symbol, has been the target of opposition that crosses racial, partisan and cultural divides.

The Mississippi Baptist Convention has called for it to be taken down. So have state associations of real estate agents, bankers, educators and manufacturers. A star football player at Mississippi State University declared that he would not play as long as the flag remained, and Kermit Davis, the University of Mississippi’s men’s basketball coach, stood with other coaches under the Capitol rotunda and said changing it was “the right thing to do.”

“I understand many view the current flag as a symbol of heritage and Southern pride,” the country music star Faith Hill, a Mississippi native, said in a post on Twitter, “but we have to realize that this flag is a direct symbol of terror for our black brothers and sisters.”

Some have framed the debate in moral terms, arguing that the flag stands in the way of scabbing over the wounds left by the past. Yet the latest efforts for change have gained momentum in large part because of economic considerations, with business and industry leaders saying that the flag discourages the investment needed to boost one of the poorest states.

The financial threat had been underscored by recent announcements by the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the Southeastern Conference that Mississippi would be precluded from hosting championship events until the flag is changed.

“Because of the N.C.A.A. and the SEC, we can point to a quantifiable damage, if you will, that is occurring — a consequence, a punishment,” Philip Gunn, a Republican who is the State House speaker, said in an interview on Friday afternoon.

Still, the growing calls to change the flag belie the extent of the division that still exists over the banner and how to interpret the legacy it symbolizes. Various polls show that, even as the number of people supporting a change has increased, nearly half of the state is resistant to the idea.

Many remain attached to the flag because they see it as an enduring recognition of the blood shed by their ancestors who fought for Mississippi and their pride in the state’s history.

“We firmly believe that this political correctness, this movement we are sensing out there right now to delegitimize our American institutions and our American history is a movement that’s incredibly dangerous and cannot be appeased,” said Chris McDaniel, a Republican state senator.

State lawmakers extended their session that had been set to end on Friday, paving the way for a vote this weekend.

Legislation proposed on Saturday would abolish the old flag and create a commission that would design a new flag that would be forbidden from having the Confederate battle emblem and must include “In God we trust.” The commission would be charged with arriving at a design that would be up for a vote on the November ballot.

One popular alternative has 19 stars encircling one larger star, an acknowledgment of Mississippi being the 20th state to join the union. That design had been known as the Stennis flag until its designer took her name off it because she is a descendant of a longtime senator who supported segregation.

Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, said on Saturday morning that he would sign a bill to change the flag. The announcement signals a marked evolution in the governor’s thinking on the subject, as he had previously said that any decision over changing the flag should be made directly by voters, not lawmakers.

“The legislature has been deadlocked for days as it considers a new state flag,” Mr. Reeves said in a statement. “The argument over the 1894 flag has become as divisive as the flag itself and it’s time to end it.”

Mississippi has grappled over the flag for decades, yet that banner continued to maintain considerable public support.

During a 2001 referendum, voters overwhelmingly decided to keep the flag as it was. Five years ago, after a white supremacist killed nine African-American worshipers in a Charleston, S.C., church, efforts to change the Mississippi flag were reinvigorated as monuments to the Confederacy were being brought down across the South, and as battle flags were lowered on statehouse grounds in Alabama and South Carolina.

Although the efforts then failed to officially change the flag, many cities moved on their own to take down the flag and all eight of the state’s public universities lowered it on their campuses.

“Mississippi has been on the cusp of change for a long time,” said Mike Espy, a former congressman and secretary of agriculture running as a Democrat for a United States Senate seat. “It’s a remnant of a bleak past, a remnant of the days when human beings were allowed to own human beings.”

“It just dredges up all those feelings for me,” he added. “I don’t feel anger. I’m just disappointed its still there.”

There were signs that the argument that had long prevailed — that changing the flag undermined a heritage embraced by much of Mississippi — was being overshadowed as lawmakers have begun to acknowledge the unsavory history it symbolized for many others.

As a cascade of lawmakers from both parties indicated in recent days that they were in favor of a change, many said that moving away from the old flag had become inevitable.

In 2017, Karl Oliver, a Republican state representative, was roundly criticized after a post on Facebook in which he lamented a move by city officials in New Orleans to take down Confederate monuments and said its proponents should be “lynched.”

“The destruction of these monuments, erected in the loving memory of our family and fellow Southern Americans,” he said in the post, “is both heinous and horrific.” (He later apologized.)

On Thursday, Mr. Oliver said the time had come for a Mississippi flag that “creates unity.”

“When my grandchildren and their children are studying this time in history, there will be questions,” he said in a statement. “I want them to know that it was because of my love for them and Mississippi, and Christ’s love for me, and for my fellow Mississippians, I based my decision on what I believed to be best for everyone.”

Louisville Police Move to Fire Officer Involved in Death of Breonna Taylor,"The police in Louisville, Ky., are moving to terminate one of the officers involved in the death of Breonna Taylor, Mayor Greg Fischer announced on Friday, the first significant action taken against an officer in a case that has drawn widespread criticism and national protests.

As one of three officers who used a no-knock warrant to enter Ms. Taylor’s apartment on March 13, the officer, Brett Hankison, blindly fired 10 rounds into a covered patio door and a window, according to a termination letter released by the Louisville Metro Police Department on Friday.

“I find your conduct a shock to the conscience,” Police Chief Robert J. Schroeder wrote. “I am alarmed and stunned you used deadly force in this fashion. You have never been trained by the Louisville Metro Police Department to use deadly force in this fashion.”

The killing of Ms. Taylor, 26, a black emergency medical technician, has for weeks fueled widespread protests and escalating questions about why little action had been taken. Those questions only intensified last week when the police released a four-page incident report of Ms. Taylor’s death, containing minimal details and aberrations, including listing “none” under victim injuries even though officers shot her at least eight times.

The other officers involved in the case — Jon Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove — have been placed on administrative reassignment.

Lonita Baker, one of three lawyers representing Ms. Taylor’s family, said the attorneys were pleased to hear that Officer Hankison would be fired but that this was just a first step.

“Based on the content of the letter, it’s our position that there’s enough to move forward with criminal charges against him,” Ms. Baker said, adding, “We look forward to all three officers being terminated and prosecuted.”

None of the officers have been charged. The decision to move forward with criminal charges now rests with the attorney general, Ms. Baker said. 

The attorney general’s office is conducting its own investigation into the events surrounding the death of Ms. Taylor, a spokeswoman, Elizabeth Goss Kuhn, said. “The investigation remains ongoing,” she said on Friday. 

Officer Hankison will have the opportunity to respond to the proposed firing, according to the termination letter. It was not immediately clear which lawyer was representing him.

The case has drawn intense scrutiny, leading city officials to ban the use of no-knock warrants, a contentious police practice that allows officers to forcibly enter homes to search them without warning.

Officers said they did announce themselves, but Ms. Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, said he did not hear any police warning as the door was beaten down. He opened fire, striking an officer in the leg. Officers fired back, killing Ms. Taylor.

In a statement on Friday, Mr. Fischer said officials could not elaborate on the decision to start termination proceedings against Officer Hankison, citing a provision in state law.

In the letter, however, the chief wrote that on Tuesday evening, he received the results of an investigation by the department’s public integrity unit and that Officer Hankison “failed to be cognizant of the direction” in which he discharged his firearm.

“Some of the rounds you fired actually traveled into the apartment next to Ms. Taylor’s endangering the three lives in the apartment,” the chief wrote. He added that Officer Hankison had been disciplined last year in a separate reckless conduct case that “injured an innocent person.” 

The F.B.I. visited Ms. Taylor’s apartment on Friday morning with a search warrant as part of its investigation into the shooting, according to Timothy Beam, a spokesman for the F.BI. in Louisville.

According to The Louisville Courier Journal, the officers who killed Ms. Taylor were investigating two men who they believed were selling drugs out of a house that was far from Ms. Taylor’s home. But a judge had also signed a warrant allowing the police to search Ms. Taylor’s residence because the police said they believed that one of the two men had used her apartment to receive packages.

No drugs were found in the apartment, a lawyer for Mr. Walker said.

Ms. Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer, said her daughter had big dreams and planned a lifelong career in health care after serving as an E.M.T.

“She had a whole plan on becoming a nurse and buying a house and then starting a family,” Ms. Palmer told The Courier Journal. “Breonna had her head on straight, and she was a very decent person. She didn’t deserve this.”"
‘I Need People to Hear My Voice’: Teens Protest Racism,"In early June, as outrage over racism and police brutality erupted nationwide, three teenagers from Katy, Texas, grew frustrated by a void of activism in their affluent Houston suburb.

They banded together under the name Katy4Justice. Over four days, through text messages and video chats, they organized a protest at a neighborhood park, leading hundreds of people in a march through soccer fields and picnic areas in the summer heat.

“Katy loves to think it’s progressive and stuff, but nothing ever happens,” said Erika Alvarez, 17, one of the three organizers, all of whom will start their senior year in the fall.

Jeffrey Jin, 17, concurred. “It’s very all talk and no do,” he said. “There’s a lot of white silence.”

“It really takes action in order for real change to come,” said Foyin Dosunmu, 16. “That’s what we’re trying to get across and drill into the minds of the people of Katy.”

The youth-led protest in Katy is representative of the way the nationwide demonstrations after George Floyd’s death have energized a diverse cohort of the youngest generation. In recent weeks, high school students have led protests in Greenville, Mich.; Laurel, Md.; and Berkeley, Calif.

Several teenagers, including those in Katy, said that it was the first time they had organized any sort of demonstration — and that it would not be the last.

In Katy, the students’ activism was years in the making, they said, shaped by their own experiences with racism.

Born in Houston to Nigerian immigrants who are engineers, Ms. Dosunmu moved to Saudi Arabia when she was 5, and then to London three years after that. She was frequently the only black girl in her class.

“I remember thinking, Oh, I wish I was white,” she said. “I felt so left out.”

Her family moved to Katy when she was in the fourth grade. She joined the Girl Scouts, and she began reading voraciously — “Harry Potter,” “Pride and Prejudice,” eventually even scientific research papers.

Throughout her school years, she encountered racism. When her family first arrived at their new home in Katy, they did not yet have a key and were accosted by a white man while trying to get inside. He yelled at them and accused them of being looters, using racist slurs, she said.

Although she takes part in speech competitions, Ms. Dosunmu had not generally been politically active. After the killings of Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, however, she began to feel guilt, she said, for her relatively safe and stable life in Katy. She felt a bubbling need to do something in her community.

“I need people to hear my voice,” she said. “I need Katy to hear what I’m thinking.”

Ms. Alvarez grew up in Maturín, 300 miles east of Venezuela’s capital, Caracas.

Her father, an electrical engineer, and her mother, then a dentist, tried to ride out the country’s deteriorating economy. But food grew scarce, and there were increasing reports of friends being robbed at gunpoint. Scheduled power outages lasted six hours a day.

“In Venezuela, it’s so blatant and obvious — you’re basically born knowing that the government is corrupt,” she said.

When her family moved to Katy four years ago, Ms. Alvarez said she felt her world expand, a diversity of both people and ideas. She buried herself in schoolwork and joined the golf team.

“I fully believed in the American dream spiel,” she said. “I was coming to a great school, great district. I was excited to have way more opportunity than I was ever going to have back home.”

With the election of President Trump in 2016, however, she began paying more attention to politics, particularly around immigration. Her dream of starting a business began morphing into political activism, she said. Her passion deepened after the mass shooting in El Paso in August.

She later joined a student group protesting gun violence in schools. As she began to pay closer attention, she started to see more and more news reports documenting police brutality.

“I was starting to kind of notice maybe the American dream wasn’t as perfect as it seemed,” she said.

Mr. Jin was born in Houston, his parents immigrants from China. He said that in elementary school, when he would bring dumplings and bok choy to school for lunch, other children would sometimes poke fun at his meals, asking why the food smelled bad.

“I guess it sort of took a hit to my appreciation for my culture,” he said. “I was very self-hating toward my culture, in terms of my childhood. I eventually stopped bringing home food and I ate cafeteria food every single day.”

Children would sometimes pull their eyes back, mocking his appearance. In middle school, he sometimes heard students use racist slurs in the halls.

He laughed it off, he said, focusing instead on academics, encouraged by parents who he said had a traditional view of how to succeed in America: study hard, work hard, raise a family.

In middle school and high school, however, he began to question those values, which he described as playing into the “model minority” stereotype. He wanted to grow beyond them. He picked up photography and began watching and analyzing films.

“It was sort of a rebellion growing up, to not align with my parents’ views,” he said.

Even as he made friends who also cared about bettering the world, he continued to hear racist slurs for black people and gay people being used by students at school.

“It’s so easy to be racist as a young person who doesn’t know any better,” he said.

After Mr. Floyd’s death, the teenagers started to see a familiar pattern unfold in Katy. White residents clung to the suburb’s welcoming image — several immigrants had moved there in recent years — and trumpeted its proximity to Houston, one of the most diverse cities in the country, as proof that their community was not a racist place.

“They think because we’re such a diverse area or city, that just makes up for everything,” Ms. Dosunmu said.

Ms. Alvarez texted Mr. Jin on May 31 asking if he would be interested in holding a protest in Katy. A few days later, he looped in Ms. Dosunmu. They created a Facebook page and promoted the June 4 protest on social media. Within days, other residents volunteered to help them with water, food, medical aid and sign language interpreters for people who are hard of hearing.

That protest will not be the end of their activism, all three agreed.

After the demonstration, the teenagers started a fund-raiser, which is still continuing, for a Houston-based center that helps care for L.G.B.T.Q. youth. They plan to hold a “student series” at their schools to showcase stories of racism from students to help others better understand the harm.

“There’s just so much to do, so much to work out,” Ms. Alvarez said. “We have a billion documents in our Google Drive.”"
"Police Groups Wield Strong Influence in Congress, Resisting the Strictest Reforms","WASHINGTON — As Americans were clamoring in the streets last week to defund the police and as Democrats in Congress were drafting legislation to make it easier to track and prosecute officer misconduct, Larry Cosme, a leader of the police lobby, was at the White House making a direct appeal to some of President Trump’s top advisers against some of the most consequential reforms.

At a meeting in the State Dining Room that included Mr. Trump, Attorney General William P. Barr and Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, Mr. Cosme and about two dozen others listened as families of victims of police violence spoke emotionally of the need for a different approach, and pledged that they were ready to make some changes.

But afterward, Mr. Cosme, the president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, pulled aside Mr. Scott, who was putting the finishing touches on Republicans’ policing bill, and Mr. Barr to push back against two of the most aggressive ideas under consideration: peeling back qualified immunity, the legal doctrine that shields police officers from lawsuits, and building a national database of civilian complaints against them.

He left the meeting unworried. “Attorney General Barr assured us it wouldn’t go that far,” Mr. Cosme recalled.

Indeed, the bill that Mr. Scott introduced the next day fell well short of that, and on Wednesday, it stalled in the Senate, as Democrats called it a woefully inadequate response to the problem of systemic racism in law enforcement. They pushed their own, far more aggressive measure through the House on Thursday, but it too has little chance of survival in the face of Republican opposition.

The resulting stalemate reflects the vast ideological gulf between the two parties and the legislative paralysis that has taken hold in Congress, where striking an election-year deal to overhaul policing was always going to be a challenge. But it is also partly a result of a quiet but successful federal lobbying campaign by law enforcement organizations and their representatives, who have spent decades building relationships in Congress and waging a persistent influence campaign of policy advocacy, political contributions and endorsements.

Staring down a bipartisan swell of momentum in Congress for passing policing legislation in response to throngs of protests against police brutality and racial bias, the groups have swung into action on Capitol Hill in recent weeks to wage a little-publicized campaign against the most sweeping reforms proposed by lawmakers: stripping officers of qualified immunity, ending no-knock warrants and building a national database of complaints against the police.

Just as unions have fought aggressively across the country to fend off changes, they have used their clout in Washington to resist new federal mandates or restrictions. Their power helps explain why Republicans have rejected some of the most aggressive measures to rein in police tactics, and why Democrats — sensing political advantage on the issue — appear to have calculated, at least for now, that their legislation is not even worth debating.

“We’re not going to abdicate our rights,” said Mr. Cosme, whose association has spent nearly $400,000 lobbying Congress since 2017. “We’re going to come out swinging. We’re not going to back down.”

They have found sympathetic ears at the White House, where Mr. Trump has declared himself the “president of law and order,” and open doors in the Senate, where Republican lawmakers refused to embrace any changes until they received assurances from law enforcement groups that they would not oppose the efforts.

“Too often we’re having a discussion in this nation about are you supporting the law enforcement community or are you supporting communities of color,” Mr. Scott said as he unveiled his bill. “This is a false binary choice.”

After conversations with Mr. Scott and his staff, Sheriff David Mahoney, the incoming president of the National Sheriffs’ Association, said his team was able to “massage some of the language” in the Republican bill to bring in “perspectives that would be more consistent with the needs of law enforcement.”

“They made a commitment to continue working with law enforcement,” Mr. Mahoney said.

His calls to Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office, by contrast, were not returned.

“I’ve not heard back from them, which is unfortunate because I’ve spoken with the staff and the speaker on many occasions,” Mr. Mahoney said.

That dynamic reflects the shifting political terrain now facing police unions and advocacy organizations on Capitol Hill, as they try to weather a national outcry in favor of placing stricter restrictions on their profession.

For years, powerful police organizations have resisted calls for major changes in the way they do their jobs, even after the widespread protests of 2015 over the killing of black people by the police. They have been successful in doing so partly through their lobbying and campaign activity, and partly because members of both political parties feared alienating them and being portrayed as “soft on crime.”

Six of the larger police organizations have spent a combined $2.9 million since 2017 lobbying the federal government. And various law enforcement entities have contributed more than $100,000 to members of Congress this election cycle, roughly evenly split between Republicans and Democrats.

They are known for their annual lobbying trips to Washington in May, when unions send representatives to glad-hand with lawmakers, staying in four-star hotels near Capitol Hill, meeting with their aides and celebrating them with yearly awards luncheons.

Law enforcement groups have condemned the killing of George Floyd during an encounter with the police in Minneapolis as “morally bankrupt” and a “betrayal of the public trust.” In response, they have embraced some reform efforts, including restrictions on chokeholds, the creation of a database of officers fired for misconduct, and increased federal funding for training in de-escalation techniques and the widespread use of body-worn cameras.

But they have fiercely fought the most far-reaching changes advocated by civil rights groups and most Democrats. They argue that stripping officers of qualified immunity could bankrupt officers over accusations that end up being false. They oppose banning no-knock warrants, which they say could endanger officers entering the homes of people with guns. And they have pushed hard against building a database cataloging all accusations — proven or not — against the police, which they view as a privacy violation.

“We welcome change, but we welcome change with an open dialogue and a seat at the table,” Mr. Cosme said.

The House passed a bill on Thursday that contained several provisions the police groups opposed. The sweeping measure would effectively end qualified immunity for officers, make it easier to track and prosecute police misconduct, strictly limit the use of lethal force and aim to compel departments to ban chokeholds and other tactics that can cut off individuals’ airways. It contains no new funding for police departments.

The legislation won the support of three moderate Republicans, who joined a united bloc of Democrats to back the measure. It is expected to run into a brick wall in the Senate, where Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has called it “typical Democratic overreach.”

Mr. Scott’s measure, by contrast, has won the support of police groups, who were pleased that it included more than $1 billion in federal grants for training and equipping the police and were relieved that it did not alter the qualified immunity doctrine that shields officers from lawsuits or mandate any other changes they are resisting.

The vast divergence reflects a political shift that is threatening to sap some of the historically bipartisan influence of police organizations at the federal level. Moderate Democrats in Congress have long seen endorsements and perfect grades from law enforcement groups as a way to emphasize their law-and-order credentials, a prerequisite for political success in many conservative-leaning districts.

But as polls show the Black Lives Matter movement gaining purchase nationwide and as protests against police brutality spring up in suburban districts, the strident opposition of unions and other police groups has lost some of its bite. When House Democrats unveiled their expansive police reform legislation, even the most politically vulnerable lawmakers signed on as sponsors.

Representative Josh Gottheimer, Democrat of New Jersey, a self-described moderate who boasts of a 100 percent score from the National Association of Police Organizations, quickly signed on to the Democrats’ bill.

He said representatives of local police unions in New Jersey are not thrilled about some of the reform efforts, but they concede the profession needs to change.

“They know they need reform,” Mr. Gottheimer said. “They’ll accept a lot of it. There’s parts of it they are more willing to accept than others.”

Aides to top Democrats say police unions have lost some sway inside the party, as its most progressive members call for dismantling departments outright. More than two dozen House Democrats — including Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan — have signed a “No Cash From Cops” pledge saying they will not take any campaign contributions from police unions.

Representative Kweisi Mfume, Democrat of Maryland and a former N.A.A.C.P. president, said he had seen more give this year from law enforcement groups like the Fraternal Order of Police than in previous eras.

“The sort of reflexive action by F.O.P.s around the country has been to push back and not want to accommodate,” Mr. Mfume said. “But because these protests are so massive and so enlarged, there might be more of a willingness now than ever before.”

Senator Mike Braun, Republican of Indiana and a lonely proponent in his party for stripping away police officers’ qualified immunity, said he believed that as instances of police violence continued to grab headlines, law enforcement groups would come around to bigger changes.

“It’s giving them a bad rap,” Mr. Braun said. “Nobody wants to change the status quo when it’s heavily in your favor — until you need to.”"
"Black Tulsans, With a Defiant Juneteenth Celebration, Send a Message to Trump","[Follow our Election Day live tracker.]

TULSA, Okla. — In a city that has become known as a landmark to black pain, Friday was a day for black joy.

More than a thousand people gathered along Greenwood Avenue — the site of one of America’s worst racist attacks — to celebrate Juneteenth, the holiday that commemorates when enslaved black Americans in Texas formally learned of emancipation. The end of a centuries-long massacre.

In any year, Juneteenth in Tulsa means something different than it does in other cities, according to black residents. The exuberance more palpable, the music more soulful, against the backdrop of the 1921 white riot that killed an estimated 300 black Tulsans and destroyed the area once known as “Black Wall Street.”

“We’re celebrating the emancipation of slaves, but we’re really celebrating the idea of being black,” said Jacquelyn Simmons, who has lived in Tulsa for 45 years. “We love it and we love us.”

But this was not any year. Organizers planned to cancel their annual Juneteenth celebration amid the national coronavirus pandemic. Then President Trump announced a campaign rally in the city, originally slated to be held on the Friday holiday but later moved to Saturday evening.

With that event looming, and national protests raging about racial injustice and police brutality, what was typically a celebration of resilience had transformed into one of defiance. “Black Lives Matter” was painted in bright yellow letters across Greenwood Avenue. Attendees said they were celebrating not only how black ancestors were freed from enslavement, but also the persistence of black Americans today — from a pandemic that has disproportionately affected black communities, police departments that disproportionately kill black people, and a president who has shown little willingness to acknowledge the reality of both.

“It’s not really about his rally for us,” said Otis Collins, 51, who drove more than four hours to Tulsa from Dallas.

He stood with his friend James Scott at the base of a memorial that lists all the unpaid claims that black Tulsans never received after 1921, a catalog of plunder.

“We want to show defiance to his act, but he’s going to have his rally and do his thing regardless,” he said. “This is about showing our people support.”

Tulsa residents understand a thing or two about confronting racist violence. Long before the killings of Trayvon Martin, Mike Brown, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd spurred a racial justice movement that is transforming American society, the city was dealing with its own history of white-on-black violence, and residents believe their journey can be a model for America.

For decades, white and black Tulsans refused to talk about the events of May 31, 1921, when a black man who worked as a shoe shiner was accused of assaulting a white woman. State history textbooks long ignored how a white mob formed at the courthouse where the man was being held, setting off a confrontation with armed members of the local black population. The city is still grappling with what happened next: A horde of thousands targeted the prosperous black businesses that were scattered on Greenwood Avenue, looting stores, burning homes in the neighborhood and killing several hundred black residents, according to witness accounts.

Much has changed in recent years, as “racial reconciliation” has become the city’s unofficial mantra, complete with street names and philanthropic efforts, supported by Democrats and Republicans alike. What it means, according to Hannibal Johnson, a professor of African-American history and a Tulsa historian, is a three-step process of “acknowledgment, apology and atonement.” It’s a process he believes could set an example for the rest of the country. It also means something tangible, a multimillion-dollar museum and cultural center set to open in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the massacre, in the spring of 2021.

Of Mr. Trump’s rally, Dr. Johnson said, “the timing has been especially troublesome given the rhetoric and the actions” of the president.

“We’re a community that’s been working a long time toward this reconciliation as it regards to race,” he said. “And this rally is seen — particularly by progressive people — as partisan and unhelpful to that cause.”

Kevin Matthews, a Democratic state senator who represents Tulsa, said the president was creating a challenge for a region that should be a model. Mr. Matthews, who is black, is the chairman of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial Commission and has worked closely with Republicans like Senator James Lankford.

“If we can do this in this city, the same one that never acknowledged the hundreds of lives lost and hasn’t found all these graves,” he said. “If we can be a beacon of reconciliation — anybody can.”

Friday’s events paid homage to the city’s history and vibrant community. Bands performed on a large stage adorned with a “Juneteenth” banner. Vendors sold food and trinkets from local black businesses. Midday, around 100 protesters marched with a coffin draped in an American flag from Greenwood Avenue to the Tulsa County Courthouse.

In the evening, the Rev. Al Sharpton took the stage and led a chant of “No justice! No peace!” He called for Juneteenth to become a federal holiday, before moving to criticism of Mr. Trump’s signature slogan. Mr. Sharpton challenged those who say “Make America Great Again” to name the date when America was “great for everyone,” and free from injustice.

This city, where the question of when all residents were free from injustice is embedded in its history, is where the Trump campaign chose to hold a rally, though the president’s campaign manager did not initially realize the significance of June 19. Just blocks from the Juneteenth celebration, a sea of Mr. Trump’s supporters braved rainstorms and 90-degree heat near the venue where he would be speaking, lining up 24 hours before the rally was set to begin.

The contrast, embodied by these two groups gathered a short walk from each other, is a microcosm of the ways Mr. Trump has defined this political era. Outside the arena, his supporter base of overwhelmingly white Americans traded stories of grievance, praising a president who they believe is the buffer between them and a rapidly changing country. At the Juneteenth celebration, officially titled “I, too, am America: Juneteenth for Justice,” a racially diverse crowd saw a link between past and present, a through line between the white anger that once set Greenwood Avenue ablaze and the coalition that elected Mr. Trump after eight years of Barack Obama, the nation’s first black president.

Charman Sanders, 70, a black Tulsa resident whose family in the region dates back to 1921, said there was no way to see Mr. Trump’s actions as anything other than “disrespectful.”

“Trump is going to be down there,” she said, pointing toward the Tulsa stadium where the president is slated to appear. “And we’re going to be down here. That’s the way I look at it.”

Members of the centennial commission said that, if anything, the president’s rally distracts from how Tulsa can be a model for how both parties can unite behind the need for racial reconciliation — citing the involvement of Mr. Lankford and the city’s Republican mayor, G.T. Bynum. They took pride in recent gestures by city leaders, which include a reconciliation dinner where residents eat a meal with a stranger and a recent apology by the Tulsa Police Department for its role in the 1921 killings.

But leaders are also cleareyed regarding the city’s persistent inequalities. Earlier this year, Mr. Bynum and his police chief, who is black, condemned an officer who appeared on a radio program and said, “We’re shooting African-Americans about 24 percent less than we probably ought to be, based on the crimes being committed.”

In a high-profile incident in 2016, a black Tulsa man named Terence Crutcher was shot and killed by a white police officer, who was charged with manslaughter but eventually acquitted. Though Mr. Crutcher was unarmed, police recordings revealed that one officer said, “That looks like a bad dude, too, could be on something,” before the shooting began.

Last year, the nongovernmental group Human Rights Watch released a report detailing the relative economic insecurity of black Tulsa residents, and later recommended they should be provided reparations for the 1921 massacre, citing the more than $2 million in unpaid property claims that were never given back to surviving residents, valued at more than $30 million considering inflation. Despite high poverty rates in Tulsa’s black community compared with other groups, leaders have consistently rebuffed efforts at financial compensation for the descendants of victims. This also mimics a challenge currently facing the country, where the “acknowledgment” and “apology” steps of Mr. Johnson’s path to racial reconciliation may be easier than the final step — “atonement.”

“You can’t fix what you haven’t faced,” Mr. Johnson said, defending the process and paraphrasing the writer and activist James Baldwin.

But some residents see a city that has mastered the art of talking about racial unity, without the actions to support it. Ms. Simmons pointed out that the city is home to both descendants of the massacre victims and the white perpetrators.

“They have to back up what they’ve been saying,” Ms. Simmons said. “I think the white people still view us as not worth anything. When we really want the same things that they do.”

Members of the centennial commission say the interest has sent fund-raising through the roof, and makes the reality of the proposed museum, called Greenwood Rising, closer to a certainty. Stars like LeBron James, the singer John Legend and Russell Westbrook have also announced intentions to produce film projects about the massacre, continuing to bring Hollywood’s attention to Tulsa’s history, following the acclaimed HBO show “Watchmen,” which depicted the events of 1921. Ms. Sanders, who was a teacher in Tulsa for 40 years and said the massacre was never taught, praised a recent decision by local and state leaders to include the event in the curriculum.

Brenda Alford, a descendant of Tulsa residents who lost their thriving businesses during the massacre, said she grew up hearing stories about how her grandmother had to hide in a church, but “I never knew what that meant.” She recounted what some family members would say when they drove past a local grave site: “You know, they’re still there,” referring to those killed in 1921.

Today, Ms. Alford leads an effort to exhume the mass unmarked graves and give the deceased a final resting place.

“I want to find my great-grandmother,” she said. “I know we need to give the people who suffered such tragedy on that day the due respect that they deserve.”

In a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Trump claimed credit for popularizing the Juneteenth holiday, though its origins date more than 150 years. “I did something good: I made Juneteenth very famous,” he said, referring to news coverage of the original rally date. “It’s actually an important event, an important time. But nobody had ever heard of it.”

Mr. Matthews, asked about the quote, sat in silence for 10 seconds before responding.

“I was shocked,” he said, though he seemed to appreciate the president’s acknowledgment of the holiday and the injustice of slavery that it connotes.

The next steps, as Tulsa knows, are apology — then atonement."
Here’s What You Need to Know About Elijah McClain’s Death,"As outrage over police brutality has erupted across the country in the wake of George Floyd’s death, a wave of fresh attention and scrutiny has been applied to older cases in which people died after encounters with the police.

One such case is that of Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old Black man who died last summer after the police in Aurora, Colo., restrained him with a chokehold that has since been banned.

Mr. McClain was walking home from a convenience store on Aug. 24, 2019, when someone called 911, saying he “looked sketchy” and was wearing a ski mask and waving his arms.

The police arrived, and after struggling to handcuff Mr. McClain, officers brought him to the ground and used a carotid hold, which restricts blood to the brain to render someone unconscious. When medical responders arrived, after about 15 minutes, paramedics injected him with ketamine, a powerful sedative.

Mr. McClain went into cardiac arrest on the way to a hospital. He died a few days later.

Mr. McClain was a massage therapist who is said to have loved animals and who taught himself to play the guitar and the violin, according to The Cut. A photograph of Mr. McClain playing the violin for stray cats, which he believed helped soothe them, has gone viral.

A GoFundMe page created by Sheneen McClain, Mr. McClain’s mother, had raised at least $2 million, and more than five million people have signed an online petition demanding that the officers involved be taken off duty and that there be an in-depth investigation of the encounter.

It is unclear what exactly caused Mr. McClain to go into cardiac arrest.

An autopsy report by the Adams County coroner said that the cause of death was “undetermined,” and that it could have been a result of natural causes, a homicide related to the carotid hold, or an accident.

But while he was detained, Mr. McClain was clearly in distress. After officers restrained him on the ground, he vomited several times, for which he apologized, saying, “I’m sorry, I wasn’t trying to do that, I can’t breathe correctly.”

An officer said in the body camera footage that officers had “put him out” with a carotid hold twice, “at least once successfully,” meaning Mr. McClain had lost consciousness.

When paramedics arrived, they gave him what was described as a “therapeutic” dose of ketamine; body camera footage shows that it made his body go limp when he was loaded onto a gurney.

The autopsy report, released in November, said a combination of factors could have killed Mr. McClain.

Mr. McClain was “violently struggling with officers, who were attempting to restrain him,” the report read. “Most likely the decedent’s physical exertion contributed to death. It is unclear if the officers’ actions contributed as well.”

In the report, it was also noted that Mr. McClain had chronic asthma.

In response to the autopsy report, Mari Newman, the lawyer representing Mr. McClain’s family, told Denver7 ABC, “Whatever the report says, it’s clear that if the police had not attacked Elijah McClain, he would be alive today.”

“They immediately went hands on and tackled him,” she said. “And of course the fact that all three of their body cameras fell off is something that we should all be pretty suspicious about. It makes it awfully easy for them to say whatever they want, but what we know is that they attacked him for no reason whatsoever. It was excessive force and it led to his death.”

Body camera footage, released three months after Mr. McClain’s death, shows three officers — identified by the Aurora authorities as Nathan Woodyard, Jason Rosenblatt and Randy Roedema — arriving at the scene at around 10:30 p.m.

One officer approached Mr. McClain, who was listening to music, and told him to stop walking. Mr. McClain stopped after several commands but said he had a right to continue toward home.

According to the camera footage, the officer responded, saying he had a right to stop Mr. McClain for looking suspicious, and grabbed him by the arms. As another officer approached, Mr. McClain can be heard saying, “I am an introvert, please respect the boundaries that I am speaking. Leave me alone.”

Though Mr. McClain had not committed a crime, officers immediately restrained him, telling him to stop resisting when he put his arms up to his chest and to “stop tensing up.” The footage shows Mr. McClain pleading with the officers to let go of him, and trying to get out of their grip.

The officers eventually brought him to the ground, claiming he had reached for one of their guns while they were pinning him against a wall to handcuff him. The body camera footage does not show this, officers said, because their cameras had fallen off into the grass.

At one point, an officer tells Mr. McClain that he would use his dog on him if he did not “stop messing around.”

More officers arrived after Mr. McClain was restrained. While talking with one another, officers said that Mr. McClain was “acting crazy,” that he was “definitely on something,” and that he had attacked officers when they tried to restrain him. They also said he had “incredible, crazy strength,” and that at one point three officers were on top of him.

The autopsy report notes that Mr. McClain was 5 feet 6 inches and weighed 140 pounds.

After Mr. McClain’s death, Officers Woodyard, Rosenblatt and Roedema were placed on administrative leave, but they have all since been reinstated.

A few days after the autopsy report was released, Dave Young, the Adams County district attorney, announced that criminal charges would not be filed, saying there was not enough evidence the officers had broken the law when they used force on Mr. McClain.

The decision angered Mr. McClain’s family, and this spring, his mother pushed lawmakers to adopt police reforms. As the case garnered more attention in the weeks following the killing of Mr. Floyd by the police, Vanessa Wilson, the interim chief of the Aurora Police Department, announced a ban on carotid holds, like the one used on Mr. McClain.

Officers are also now required to report excessive force used by their colleagues, and to announce their intention to use deadly force before firing their weapon.

And on June 25, Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado signed an executive order appointing the state’s attorney general, Phil Weiser, to re-examine the case and file charges if the facts support prosecution.

“Elijah McClain should be alive today,” Mr. Polis said in a statement, “and we owe it to his family to take this step and elevate the pursuit of justice in his name to a statewide concern.”

On Aug. 11, 2020, Mr. McClain’s family filed a lawsuit against the city of Aurora. The civil complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court by Mr. McClain’s parents, Sheneen McClain and Lawayne Mosley, seeks damages for the family and names the city, 12 police officers, two fire department paramedics and the department’s medical director as defendants.

“In a span of 18 minutes, defendants subjected Elijah to a procession of needless and brutal force techniques and unnecessary, recklessly administered medication, the combined effects of which he could not survive,” the lawsuit said.

That same day, Mr. Weiser announced an investigation into whether the Aurora Police Department has employed “patterns and practices” that may deprive people of their constitutional rights. The investigation will be a broad look at the police department’s record of arrests, stops, searches and use of force.

"Author Brittney Cooper on Harnessing Rage, Right Now","— Brittney Cooper, author of “Eloquent Rage,” on the recent protests

This article is a collaboration between The New York Times and The Fuller Project.

The “angry black woman” stereotype has been picked apart and widely condemned in recent years. Michelle Obama has spoken about distancing herself from the trope. Shonda Rhimes, the Hollywood showrunner, has fought back against the label too. When Serena Williams was penalized for “verbal abuse” of an umpire in 2018, there was repudiation of the stereotype again.

But Brittney Cooper, a scholar and activist, has urged black women to reclaim the label rather than reject it entirely. “The clarity that comes from rage should also tell us what kind of world we want to see, not just what kind of things we want to get rid of,” Dr. Cooper writes in “Eloquent Rage: A Black Feminist Discovers Her Superpower.”

The focus of Dr. Cooper’s writing — how anger can be a rational, revolutionary principle — has proved resonant in recent weeks amid nationwide protests against police brutality, discussions of systemic inequality and black Americans dying from Covid-19 at alarming rates.

A few days before Juneteenth, I spoke with Dr. Cooper, an associate professor of women’s and gender studies and Africana studies at Rutgers University, about the shared anger of black women and why that power needs to be harnessed right now.

The interview has been shortened and edited for clarity.

In light of the past month, how are you thinking about the future of black women and girls?

The public narrative is about black women and girls continuing to express their collective outrage about the killing of black men. But you don’t just see black women in the street protesting. You also see them behaving politically in ways that are designed to build and restore public institutions, so that it can support more citizens. That’s not a thing that has just emerged in the middle of a pandemic. There’s very little investment in recognizing that black women are the sort of deep thinkers and theorists about how you actually build a society for the common good.

You recently wrote an op-ed for Time questioning why the death of Breonna Taylor, who was killed on March 13, didn’t ignite national protests immediately. You used the term “secondary outrage” to describe the reaction to her death. What did you mean by that?

Black women are not the folks who are the first thought ever when it comes to black protest movements.

Some folks said to me, Look, we were in the middle of a pandemic and that’s why there wasn’t a protest, not that there wasn’t outrage. I said, Look, we’re still in the middle of a pandemic and George Floyd got killed, and people said, We will not stand for this, so we will risk it all in the streets, multiple days — and at this point, multiple weeks — of massive protest, doing the one thing that we’re told will get you sick. So it is that moment where the culture cannot abide the killing of a black man in that way but the culture can abide it when it’s a black woman being killed by police. And she’s attacked in her house, sleeping. She’s not even under arrest. And we see that as the lesser evil.

It seems like black women’s stories are erased in the public sphere but also in the private sphere …

You know, we have this thing in feminist theory where we say, The public sphere is traditionally the sphere of men and the private sphere is traditionally the sphere of women and, of course, we mean white men and white women. So what black folks are outraged about is that the public sphere is not a sphere that is particularly hospitable to black men. But we do not react as vehemently when we learn that the private sphere is not a sphere that’s hospitable to black women.

Do you think in our lifetimes we’ll see national protests over the death of a black woman, on par with the reaction to Trayvon Martin or George Floyd?

The critical mass we’ve seen suggests something is shifting in the ether, so I’m hopeful. But we’ve got to decide if that’s our marker of success. Is the marker of success for black protest that something so horrific happens to a black woman that now we are outraged? The political thinking that leads to that is already a problem. There are all of these other cascading conditions that make black life hard as hell to live — whether we’re talking food deserts or health care or the education system or even intra-communal violence. It has to be about all of those other things that kill us quite slowly but deliberately in our communities every day.

What’s your assessment of the protests so far?

Nobody has thought, apparently, in weeks of protest that if you have that many people in the streets, then part of what you should be demanding is more PPE, more testing, more funding for vaccines and laptops for kids if schools don’t reopen. The police kill about 230 black people a year. The pandemic has killed over 22,000 black people in three months.

Who is Darnella Frazier, and why did you write about her?

Darnella Frazier was the 17-year-old black girl who was heading to the store with friends, saw the officer putting his knee on George Floyd’s neck and took out her camera and filmed it. So most of the iconic images that we’ve seen from that moment were shots of her video. I’m just reminded that there are always these black girls bearing witness to the racial atrocities. There’s a way that we ride for the black man who died and we ignore the black women who witness it and live.

We’re talking a few days before Juneteenth. Do you believe embracing anger and rage is part of breaking the intergenerational cycle of slavery?

Our ancestors have been fighting back since enslavement. They were jumping off the boats. They were staging mutiny on the ships. I like to see us as being in this long tradition of struggle and I think black people have always been clear about their rage.

Trump Rally Fizzles as Attendance Falls Short of Campaign’s Expectations,"TULSA, Okla. — President Trump’s attempt to revive his re-election campaign sputtered badly on Saturday night as he traveled to Tulsa for his first mass rally in months and found a far smaller crowd than his aides had promised him, then delivered a disjointed speech that did not address the multiple crises facing the nation or scandals battering him in Washington.

The weakness of Mr. Trump’s drawing power and political skills, in a state that voted for him overwhelmingly and in a format that he favors, raised new questions about his electoral prospects for a second term at a time when his poll numbers were already falling. And rather than speak to the wide cross-section of Americans who say they are concerned about police violence and systemic racism, he continued to use racist language, describing the coronavirus as “Kung Flu.”

transcript

This weekend in Tulsa, the president held his first campaign rally since March, after the coronavirus pandemic suspended the campaign trail. “So we begin, Oklahoma we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma!” It was also the weekend of Juneteenth. For many black Americans, Juneteenth is a celebration of the end of slavery in this country. This was a moment that resulted in scenes like this. “You are a sellout!” ”Black people die [inaudible]” [shouting] The timing of the president’s rally, on the weekend of Juneteenth, also comes at a time where there have been weeks of nationwide protests against racism and police brutality. “Hands up! Don’t shoot!” It is particularly poignant in the South, and in Tulsa, because of the history of racial oppression here. Rather than a president that showed deference to the racial history of this city or to try to further the efforts of racial reconciliation, we saw him upend them. “About the first grade, we came to Tulsa. We moved to Tulsa. So, I kind of grew up on Greenwood. When I entered college and took black history, and my professor, he said, ‘Do you all know about the race massacre?’ And we were all like, ‘No. We had a riot here?’ You know. And he was just like, ‘OK, so everybody sit down and listen to this story.’” In the early 1900s, the Greenwood area of Tulsa was a thriving black neighborhood. “African-Americans, two generations out of slavery, pursued and exhibited black excellence.” “We had our own banks and hospitals and theaters and restaurants.” But that success didn’t sit well with the white community. And in 1921, after a black man was accused of disrespecting a white woman, things escalated. A white mob burned and looted Black Wall Street. “The violence lasted roughly 16 hours.” “They shot. They looted. They bombed.” “They threw bodies in the river. They threw them in mass graves.” “When the dust settled, some 100 to 300 people were killed. At least 1,250 homes were destroyed in the black community. Schools, churches and business were destroyed as well.” “Total devastation, like a war zone. What happened here was a momentous tragic event.” “That was the worst horrific story that I ever heard in my life.” “This church, we were building in 1921, our sanctuary — they destroyed that. And our basement miraculously survived. The damage on this pillar comes from when concrete burned. In this room, also we have soil collections from the different sites where people were killed.” After years of ignoring the massacre, many in Tulsa want to make it front and center of the community’s conversation. They set up this bipartisan commission to do a number of initiatives to bring forward the issue of racial reconciliation and commemorate the centennial anniversary of the massacre. And some institutions have apologized. “I’m sorry that the police department did not protect its citizens during the tragic days of 1921.” The hard part has been what to do next. “We demand reparations in honor of all those Americans that were killed! We demand reparations now!” “Saying ‘I’m sorry’ is not repentance. You know, saying ‘I’m sorry’ just recognizes what you did is wrong. Repentance is turning away from what you did that makes you sorry. Before you can even get to atonement, we have to have a society that admits that white supremacy is wrong. We’ve got to have a society that admits that black lives matter.” The president has tried to present himself as a unifying figure, as someone who can bring the country together, particularly in times of these dual crises: the coronavirus pandemic and the national unrest around race and racial inequality. But this weekend shows his challenges on that front and the inability of this administration to, frankly, get out of its own way. Juneteenth is, for many black Americans, a celebration of the emancipation of slavery. The president initially announced a rally on Juneteenth. When you talk to people, they say there was a moment of disbelief that the president was coming to Tulsa. “My first reaction was, ‘How disrespectful.’ I felt like it was a slap in the face.” And after pleas, even from Republican senators in the state, he moved the rally to the next day.” “Beep beep. Beep beep. It’s important to me because it’s history, it’s freedom. Girl, you’re looking good. It’s good to see you, long time. It’s education.” “You want to make America great again? You have to make Black Wall Street great again.” “And it’s important this year because people get to see that, hey, they’re still fighting for a cause, but they’re celebrating our freedom.” “To come on the weekend of Juneteenth shows that he has still not that much respect for our sacred day.” Ultimately, the president’s rally wasn’t as big as his campaign had hoped. But the significance of this weekend is seen in scenes like this. “I see you back there shaking your head. Yes, sir, black lives matter.” And one of the takeaways around this moment, around race in this country, has been the shifting public opinion about questions of systemic racism and persistent inequality. “No justice!” “No peace!” “No justice!” “No peace!” That lack of acknowledgement puts him at odds with even some members of his own party. The president’s strategy on race and on other issues has just narrowed his path to re-election. He has not shown a willingness to try to expand his base, leaving him fairly reliant on a similar group of voters that got him elected in 2016 to do so again in 2020.

While the president’s campaign had claimed that more than a million people had sought tickets for the rally, the 19,000-seat BOK Center was at least one-third empty during the rally. A second, outdoor venue was so sparsely attended that he and Vice President Mike Pence both canceled appearances there.

Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, falsely blamed the small numbers on “radical protesters” and the news media who he said had frightened away supporters. But there were few protests in the area and no sizable effort to block entrances, and there was a strong security presence.

Mr. Trump was furious about the unused outdoor stage and the comparatively thin crowd in the stadium, according to two people familiar with his reaction. News broadcasts carried video of the partially empty stadium, and even the Drudge Report, a reliably conservative website, carried an all-caps headline that said “MAGA LESS MEGA” with a picture of rows and rows of empty blue seats.

The disappointing turnout came as Mr. Trump already found himself under siege about his sudden firing of the U.S. attorney in Manhattan and his losing legal battle over the release of a memoir full of damaging revelations by John R. Bolton, his former national security adviser. And in Tulsa, Mr. Trump faced criticism for ignoring pleas from officials about health risks to rallygoers and for restarting his “Make America Great Again!” rallies in a city where a white mob massacred hundreds of black residents 99 years ago.

In rambling, grievance-filled remarks, Mr. Trump made no reference to the Tulsa massacre of 1921 or to George Floyd, whose death at the hands of a white police officer in Minneapolis last month spurred global demands for racial justice. He also did not mention Juneteenth, which marks the end of slavery in the United States and fell just a day before his rally.

Instead, the president railed about “left-wing radicals” who he falsely claimed were rioting in cities across the country and praised police officers who “get injured, they don’t complain. They’re incredible” while attempting to stop looters and rioters.

“The unhinged left-wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments, tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control,” Mr. Trump said. He was referring in part to attempts to remove Confederate monuments, efforts that have support in both parties.

The president once again shrugged off the threat from the coronavirus, which he also called the “Chinese virus” at one point, and bragged that he has done “a phenomenal job” fighting the pandemic. He acknowledged that increased testing for the virus revealed more cases of infection, which he felt made the country look bad.

“So I said to my people, ‘slow the testing down,’” he said.

Many of the thousands of Trump supporters at the rally did not wear masks or stand six feet apart — health precautions that Mr. Trump himself has ignored. The campaign conducted temperature checks and handed out masks, yet health experts remained concerned that the event could be a dangerous incubator for the virus, spreading through the building’s recirculated air.

It was unclear whether fears about the virus kept Trump supporters away despite the president’s repeated efforts to dismiss the need for social distancing and other precautions.

A few hours before the event, the campaign disclosed that six Trump campaign staff members who had been working on the rally had tested positive for the coronavirus during a routine screening. Two members of the Secret Service in Tulsa also tested positive for the virus, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Trump, who was made aware of the sick campaign aides before departing for the rally, was incensed that the news was made public, according to two people familiar with his reaction.

Minor confrontations between protesters and Trump supporters broke out throughout the evening. Several dozen protesters marched about a block away from the entrance to the arena, bearing signs with messages like “Black Lives Matter” and “Go home Donald.”

Trump supporters yelled “USA! USA!” as they walked by. “Go home, racists!” the protesters chanted as the crowd swelled to hundreds of people. Some heated conversations broke out along Boulder Avenue in downtown Tulsa, but when one man tried to start an “all lives matter” chant as a man in a Black Lives Matter shirt spoke, it did not catch on.

While rallies are Mr. Trump’s favorite events, election-year politics has changed since his last one, on March 2. The coronavirus has largely shut down the campaign trail, and more recently the national political conversation has been dominated by a fierce debate over police violence against black Americans after the killing of Mr. Floyd. 

But the altered political landscape has had little effect on the president, whom advisers describe as feeling like a caged animal during the national lockdown that forced him to abandon most travel. They say he is determined to recapture the excitement of his pre-virus campaign rallies, but this one seemed unlikely to offer much relief to Mr. Trump.

He flew to Oklahoma amid mounting questions about the firing of Geoffrey S. Berman, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, whose office had investigated some of the president’s closest allies, imprisoning Michael D. Cohen, his former personal lawyer, and beginning an inquiry into Rudolph W. Giuliani, his current lawyer.

On Saturday afternoon, Attorney General William P. Barr announced that Mr. Trump had personally approved Mr. Berman’s firing. But soon afterward, as Mr. Trump left the White House for the trip to Tulsa, the president said that “we have a very capable attorney general, so that’s really up to him. I’m not involved.”

The campaign had chosen to return first to Oklahoma, which the president won by 36 points in 2016, assuming his appearance would be wildly popular there. Aides to Mr. Trump spent the week boasting about enormous interest from people in the rally, and Mr. Trump bragged on Saturday as he left for Oklahoma that “the crowds are unbelievable,” which proved false.

Some users of social media said on Saturday night that teenagers helped keep attendance at the rally down by seeking tickets they did not intend to use. TikTok and Twitter users posted that they had registered potentially hundreds of thousands of tickets for Trump’s campaign rally as a prank after @TeamTrump tweeted asking supporters to register for free tickets.

During his speech, Mr. Trump delivered a defensive, 15-minute explanation of images that showed him ambling slowly down a ramp after delivering the commencement address at the West Point military academy last weekend. He blamed his slow walk on “leather soles” on his shoes and said he was trying not to fall on his behind.

He also took several sips of water out of a glass after video at the West Point event showed him struggling to bring a glass up to his lips. He said he was trying to make sure he did not spill the water on his tie. The crowd applauded wildly.

Many people in Tulsa, worried about the record numbers of coronavirus cases in Oklahoma in recent days, did not welcome the rally. On Saturday afternoon, local black leaders held a news conference in the city’s historic Greenwood neighborhood, where the 1921 massacre took place, pleading with the city’s mayor, G.T. Bynum, a Trump ally, to cancel the rally.

In the streets around the BOK Center before the rally, the president’s supporters — some of whom had lined up for days in the hopes of ensuring a seat in the stadium — gathered not far from Black Lives Matter protesters and people in town for the Juneteenth celebration. Many wore red MAGA hats while others wore caps with patriotic emblems or colors. Some waved red, white and blue banners with the Trump 2020 logo, the American flag, or the “Don’t Tread on Me” flag. Some wore them like capes. Almost none wore masks.

“If it is God’s will that I get coronavirus that is the will of the Almighty. I will not live in fear,” said Robert Montanelli, a resident of Broken Arrow, a Tulsa suburb.

The president and his advisers hope the return to the campaign trail will help deflect attention from a daily stream of crises engulfing the White House. On Saturday, a federal judge refused to block the release of Mr. Bolton’s book, though he said the former national security aide may be personally liable for revealing classified information.

People close to Mr. Trump also said that the lack of regular adulation that he receives from the cheering crowds since the coronavirus lockdowns has left him morose and irritable. And his advisers had hoped that the rally would be a positive outlet for his energy, as opposed to his Twitter feed, where he has posted several self-destructive messages in the last several weeks.

After the rally, Mr. Trump’s spokesman searched for a way that Mr. Trump might be happy despite the poor turnout, claiming in a statement that millions of online rally viewers amounted to “a massive audience that Joe Biden can only dream of.”

Driven in part by poll numbers showing his support slipping as he prepares to face former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in the fall, Mr. Trump had initially scheduled his rally for Friday. He later said he was unaware of the significance of the Juneteenth holiday.

Under fire, the campaign moved the event to Saturday, leaving Mr. Trump to make the wild claim that he had revealed the existence of the holiday to many people despite the fact that millions of black Americans have celebrated Juneteenth annually for years.

By late morning in Tulsa on Saturday, a steadily growing line of rallygoers had assembled. Some had traveled significant distances, but many other attendees were Tulsa locals or came from nearby states, like Kansas and Missouri, or elsewhere in deep-red Oklahoma. The crowd was overwhelmingly white, and most people ranged in age from their 40s to their 60s, though a sizable number of attendees also brought their children.

In more than a dozen interviews, no one expressed serious concerns about coronavirus risk at the rally.

“It’s all fake,” said Mike Alcorn, 40, who works in maintenance and lives in Wichita, Kan. “They’re just making the numbers up. I haven’t seen anybody die, not from coronavirus. I don’t even know anybody who’s got it.”

Atlanta Mourns Rayshard Brooks in a Sanctuary Imbued With Civil Rights History,"[Here’s what you need to know about the death of Rayshard Brooks.]

ATLANTA — Like so many others whose names have been chanted in protests across the country after fatal encounters with the police, Rayshard Brooks has become a symbol.

At a pulpit imbued with a legacy connected to the fight for civil rights, a series of speakers lamented on Tuesday afternoon the societal forces that had steered Mr. Brooks’s life and, in their view, contributed to its end. There was the pernicious threat of racism and its many permutations, including the undertow of the criminal justice system that can become impossible to escape. And there was the deep mistrust between law enforcement and the African-American community.

“We’re here to sit with this family,” said the Rev. Dr. Raphael G. Warnock, the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church, referring to Mr. Brooks’s wife and children sitting before him. “But we would not be honest if we did not discuss what got us here in the first place.”

“This is about him,” Pastor Warnock, who is also a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate, added, “but it is much bigger than him.”

Mr. Brooks’s family, most of them dressed in white, filed into Ebenezer on Tuesday, joined by prominent pastors, elected officials, activists and celebrities who did not know Mr. Brooks when he was alive. The crowd did not fill the church, as people were spaced out six feet apart in the pews and wore masks in a sanctuary that had been closed for services since March, all because of the coronavirus. Hundreds more watched online.

The funeral combined soaring rhetoric calling for his death to be an impetus for change with quiet reflections about the life of a largely ordinary man who only became known because of how he died. Mr. Brooks, 27, was fatally shot on June 12 by the Atlanta police, in a moment when the nation was wrestling with its tangled racial history after a series of recent police killings.

The Rev. Bernice A. King, the youngest daughter of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., described how Mr. Brooks fit into the patchwork of a larger struggle. She pointed out that he was killed on the same day that the civil rights activist Medgar Evers was gunned down in 1963 and that, a year later, Nelson Mandela was sentenced to life in prison for conspiring against the white South African government.

Mr. Brooks’s mother-in-law, Rochelle Gooden, said he loved old rhythm-and-blues songs and liked to barbecue.

“He always took me as Mom,” she said, referring to how they would address each other, “and I always took him as Son. I never called him Rayshard, I called him my son.”

The funeral also invoked other African-Americans whose killings have fueled protests in recent months, including Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black man who was fatally shot while jogging through a coastal Georgia neighborhood.

Mr. Arbery’s death, in late February, inspired a hate-crimes measure that passed the State Senate on Tuesday, shortly before Mr. Brooks’s funeral began. Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, a Republican, has indicated his support for it.

Mr. Brooks was killed as protests had already broken out across the country after George Floyd died in May in the custody of the Minneapolis police. The killings inflamed longstanding tensions between communities of color and law enforcement, and also expanded into a larger grappling over the racial divides that figure into almost every facet of American life.

Over generations, in moments of triumph as well as turmoil, Ebenezer Baptist Church has been where many African-Americans in Atlanta find comfort in their faith and in one another. During the fight for civil rights, it had been the pastoral home of Dr. King, becoming known as “America’s Freedom Church.”

The community gathered on Tuesday during what has emerged as another turbulent chapter for Atlanta, where the atmosphere had become especially fraught after weeks of protests.

“This happened in Atlanta, the city that’s supposed to be too busy to hate,” Ms. King said, referring to a motto repeated for decades in the city, a reflection of its sprawling ambition and place as a capital of commerce and culture for the black community. “This happened in the city known as the black mecca.”

The crowd at the funeral reflected the promise of Atlanta: in the pews were the city’s mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, who is a black woman; T.I., the rapper and activist; and Phaedra Parks, the lawyer and former “Real Housewives of Atlanta” cast member. The service was paid for by Tyler Perry, the entertainment mogul who built a 330-acre compound in the city from which he churns out movies and television shows.

Yet the funeral also showed where Atlanta had fallen short, including the systemic inequality that endures in the city and elsewhere.

Mr. Brooks was killed after two police officers were called to a Wendy’s parking lot where, the authorities said, Mr. Brooks had fallen asleep in the drive-through lane.

As the officers moved to arrest Mr. Brooks, he hit an officer, grabbed the other officer’s Taser, fired it and took off running. One of the officers, Garrett Rolfe, discharged his own Taser and reached for his 9-millimeter Glock handgun as Mr. Brooks turned and discharged the stolen Taser again. Mr. Rolfe fired, striking Mr. Brooks twice in the back.

“Rayshard Brooks wasn’t just running from the police,” Pastor Warnock said, noting Mr. Brooks’s past interactions with the criminal justice system. He was on probation and faced a return to prison if arrested that night.

“He was running from a system that makes slaves out of people,” he said. “This is much bigger than the police. This is about a whole system that cries out for renewal and reform.”

Within hours of the shooting, Mr. Rolfe was fired from the Police Department, and the city’s police chief, Erika Shields, resigned. Several days later, the Fulton County district attorney, Paul L. Howard Jr., announced that Mr. Rolfe was being charged with 11 counts, including felony murder and aggravated assault. The other officer, Devin Brosnan, who was placed on administrative duty, was charged with aggravated assault and violating his oath as an officer.

On Tuesday, the authorities said that they had arrested a woman, identified as Natalie White, who is accused of setting a fire that burned down the Wendy’s where Mr. Brooks had encountered the police.

Before his death, relatives and friends said that Mr. Brooks had been pushing toward a better place. “Your past doesn’t define you, it refines and shapes you so that you are better equipped to step into your God-given purpose,” said Ambrea Mikolajczyk, who owns a restoration and construction company where Mr. Brooks had worked. “The system kept drawing him in, grabbing ahold of him like quicksand.”

Still, those who knew Mr. Brooks remembered him for more than his troubles. He was a caring father, they said, and a dancer who tended to have more enthusiasm than ability.

After she passed a golden coffin decorated with bursts of white flowers on her way to the front of the church, Ms. Gooden, Mr. Brooks’s mother-in-law, said that his legacy would live on through his family, particularly in his three daughters.

“I look at my grandbaby right there,” she said, noting a strong resemblance. “When I look at her, I know he’s not gone.”

How Statues Are Falling Around the World,"The statues have stood for more than a century in some places. Some are cast in bronze, others carved in stone. And all over the world, as protests against racism and police violence have renewed attention on legacies of injustices, people have been asking: Does this statue still need to be here?

The answer from some protesters has been a resounding no.

In England, a 17th-century slave trader was dumped into Bristol Harbor. In Antwerp, a Belgian king who brutalized Congo was burned and ultimately removed. And in the United States, more than a dozen statues have been toppled, including several Confederate figures. 

In dozens more cities, those that still stand have been marked with graffiti, challenged anew with petitions and protests, or scheduled for removal.

Here’s a look at what’s happened to some of them.

A statue of Edward Ward Carmack stood at the State Capitol in Nashville for more than 90 years before it was toppled on May 30. Carmack was a lawmaker and newspaper editor in Nashville and Memphis in the early 1900s. He endorsed the lynching of three black men who were trying to open a grocery store, and incited a mob to attack the newspaper editor, journalist and activist Ida B. Wells.

Carmack was shot dead in 1908 by the son of a political rival. His statue was erected in 1927.

After the statue came down, protesters draped a banner over its base declaring the area Ida B. Wells Plaza in its place.

On June 8, an image of George Floyd, whose death in police custody in Minneapolis helped set off the protests against police violence, was projected on the base of the statue of Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general, which towers over the city’s Monument Avenue. Days later, a pride flag was projected onto the statue.

Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia, a Democrat, has ordered the removal of the statue under a new state law that goes into effect on July 1, which will allow cities to decide for themselves the fates of such monuments. (A judge later blocked the removal.) The City Council said this month it had the votes to remove other statues on Monument Avenue as well.

Protesters in Richmond have also toppled a Jefferson Davis statue, thrown one of Christopher Columbus in a lake, toppled the Howitzers Monument, which featured a Confederate artilleryman, and torn down a statue of William Carter Wickham, a Confederate cavalry commander.

On June 10, less than a day after the Columbus statue in Richmond came down, a 10-foot bronze sculpture of Columbus was toppled outside the State Capitol in St. Paul, Minn., after a group of protesters tied ropes around the statue’s neck and yanked it from its pedestal.

The Capitol is about 10 miles from where a Minneapolis police officer pinned his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes.

In Boston, the head of a statue of Columbus in the city’s North End neighborhood was removed the same day.

In Miami and Kenosha, Wis., statues of Columbus were painted. In Columbus, Ohio, Mayor Andrew J. Ginther said the explorer’s statue on the south side of City Hall would be removed and placed in storage. The Columbus Dispatch reported that there were also plans to remove the Columbus statue outside Columbus State Community College.

On June 22, protesters tried to pull down a statue of President Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Park near the White House. After police officers with riot shields and pepper spray moved in, the statue of Jackson on horseback ultimately remained upright that night.

Jackson, the seventh president, owned slaves and put into place policies that forced Native Americans from their land, with some 15,000 people dying on the Trail of Tears.

Protesters toppled a bronze statue of the 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston into Bristol Harbor on June 7, forcing Britain to consider how to confront its racist history.

Colston, a merchant, profited richly from slavery, transporting at least 80,000 people from West Africa to the Caribbean. Almost 20,000 of them died on the voyages. Now that the statue, erected in 1895, is gone, critics want to replace it with a statue of Paul Stephenson, a black worker who led a boycott of the Bristol Omnibus Company in 1963 to force it to end discriminatory hiring practices against minority workers.

Two days later, the statue of Robert Milligan outside of the Museum of London Docklands was removed by the local authorities. He was a slave trader who, by the time of his death in 1809, owned two sugar plantations and 526 slaves in Jamaica. The museum said the statue was problematic for “whitewashing history, which disregards the pain of those who are still wrestling with the remnants of the crimes Milligan committed against humanity.”

A bust of Belgian King Leopold II that had been painted red was removed by a city worker in Auderghem, near Brussels, on June 12.

Another statue of Leopold had been removed from a public square in Antwerp three days earlier.

More than 80,000 people have signed a petition to remove all statues of Leopold from Belgium, as the country grapples with a leading figure of its colonial past. His forces seized Congo in the late 19th century and ran an exploitative regime that led to the deaths of millions.

In Dallas, construction crews recently removed a 12-foot-tall bronze statue of a Texas Ranger, long seen as a mythical figure in state folklore, amid concerns over historical episodes of police brutality and racism within the law enforcement agency. It had stood in the main lobby of the city’s Love Field airport since 1963.

Christopher J. Perry, the aviation department spokesman, said the statue would be put in storage and its fate would be decided by the Office of Arts and Culture.

On June 13, a statue of Jefferson Davis was removed from the Capitol Rotunda, where it had stood for more than 80 years, commemorating the president of the Confederate States of America. (Though Davis was born in Kentucky, the state declared itself officially neutral at the start of the Civil War.)

A statue of the 26th president that has stood at the Museum of Natural History since 1940 will be removed, officials announced on June 21. The objection was not to Roosevelt himself — whose family helped found the museum — but to the symbolism of the Native American man and the African man who stand beside him.

When the Toppled Statue Is of Your Great-Great-Great-Grandfather,"Clayton Wickham, 28, said he used to think of the statue of his great-great-great-grandfather as “just a statue that had my name on it that was kind of cool to walk by every now and then.”

But as Mr. Wickham learned more about his ancestor, the statue became a source of discomfort, and then of shame.

And so when protesters in Richmond, Va., recently tore down the bronze statue of Williams Carter Wickham, a Confederate general and plantation owner, Mr. Wickham was glad to see it fall.

Not all the Wickhams were happy. But, as for Robert W. Lee IV, a great-great-great-great-nephew of the Confederate general, and Frank Rizzo Jr., the son of the former Philadelphia mayor, the toppling of monuments across the country has been a re-evaluation of both the nation’s history and their family story.

The police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month and the protests it set off have renewed efforts to remove statues of Confederate figures and others whose presence in public parks and along city plazas has grown more controversial.

Just over half of registered voters said in one recent poll that they supported removing Confederate statues from public spaces. In 2017, only 39 percent supported taking them down.

Wickham’s white descendants are among those who have changed their minds in recent years. In 1995, some paid to have the statue cleaned and polished as a gift to another family member. But several descendants had more recently urged officials in Richmond to remove the monument that was established in 1891.

Their views changed after they saw the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017, and after meeting with the descendant of one of the 275 people their ancestor had enslaved.

Reggie Harris, 67, is a descendant of both Wickham and Bibanna Hewlett, a black woman who was enslaved at Wickham’s plantation. For Mr. Harris, a musician and teacher, the statue has been a painful reminder of the abuse his family suffered and of America’s refusal to fully acknowledge its past.

Mr. Harris and some of Wickham’s other descendants met for dinner in 2012, and when the statue came up as a topic of conversation, they decided to visit it together.

“We all looked at each other and we said, ‘Well, what do we do with this?’” Mr. Harris recalled of their visit to the monument. “Because we had had conversations about our relationship, and trying to put that all in some perspective, and now we had this bronze and concrete memorial to this person who, you know, complicated history.”

Clayton Wickham and his brother Will wrote a letter to Richmond’s mayor in 2017, asking that the statue be removed, but it remained in place. Then, suddenly, protesters tied a rope around the statue this month and tore it down themselves. Mr. Harris said it was satisfying to see it topple.

On Wednesday, in a video call with two Wickhams and a reporter, he was also moved by how much his white relatives’ views had changed.

“I didn’t know that you had voted to have the statue cleaned a few years back and that now you were regretting that you’d done that,” he said to Clayton Wickham and Mr. Wickham’s aunt, Wallis Raemer, during the call. “That’s real stuff, that’s real history. That’s not this idealized thing of ‘let bygones be bygones.’ That’s people struggling with all those things that people talk about — legacy and heritage and adopting new thought.”

A similar union is playing out in North Augusta, S.C., where a white descendant of Thomas McKie Meriwether is urging the city to remove a monument to McKie Meriwether, the lone white man killed during the Hamburg Massacre of 1876, in which a group of white men attacked and killed several members of a black militia. After publicly pushing for the removal, Brittany Meriwether Williamson, the descendant, met and teamed up with Rodney Cainston Young, a black man who is a descendant of McKie Meriwether’s family and a woman enslaved by his family, WJBF-TV in Augusta, Ga., reported.

But many descendants of figures knocked over by protesters or local governments are angry about the decisions.

In Jacksonville, Fla., one descendant of Charles Hemming, a Confederate soldier, told WJXT-TV that he was frustrated the city’s mayor had removed a statue of Hemming without telling his family. And a group of descendants of Confederate soldiers in Mobile, Ala., said they wanted the city to send a statue of Raphael Semmes, a Confederate admiral, to them after it was removed this month, according to AL.com.

The effort to dismantle Confederate statues has morphed into the removal of statues honoring more recent politicians and even to historical figures with legacies of fighting slavery. Activists in San Francisco last week toppled a statue of Ulysses S. Grant, the former president who led the Union army to victory and who also owned a slave whom he later freed. And in Madison, Wis., on Tuesday night, demonstrators pulled down a statue of Hans Christian Heg, who died fighting for the Union in the Civil War.

But most of the protesters’ ire has been trained on Confederate statues, and among those urging their removal is an unexpected name: Robert W. Lee IV.

Mr. Lee, 27, grew up thinking of the Confederate general he is named after as a hero. He hung a Confederate flag in his bedroom until middle school, when a mentor urged him to take it down, and he was proud of his Southern heritage, believing in its “lost cause” mythology.

The turning point came when he saw throngs of white supremacists rally around his ancestor’s statue in Charlottesville in 2017.

“You want to love your family, you want to be proud of your family, you want to be proud of your name, you want your name to mean something,” said Mr. Lee, a pastor. “So this has been quite hard for me.”

At the same time, he said, it is liberating to publicly atone for his family’s past, and to be part of correcting how Lee, a slave owner with many racist beliefs, is remembered. 

Shortly after the police killing of Mr. Floyd, Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia said he would move to take down the statue of Lee, and the protests sweeping the nation have also influenced Mr. Lee’s father.

“He looked at me the other day, on Father’s Day actually, and he said, ‘You know, I’ve really thought about this a lot, and I’m seeing that it’s hurting people, the statues staying up,’” Mr. Lee recalled.

 

Mr. Harris said protesters’ destruction of some monuments could create animosity among those opposed to their removal, but he noted that the Wickhams had unsuccessfully tried to get the ball rolling for years.

“So often, as they say, if you don’t adapt, you kind of get run over by the change as it comes through,” Mr. Harris said.

In Raleigh, N.C., a statue of Josephus Daniels was pulled down this month at the request of a group of his descendants. Mr. Daniels, a former publisher and editor of The News & Observer, championed white supremacist views and helped to incite the 1898 massacre in Wilmington, N.C., in which black businesses were burned and dozens of black people were killed.

Frank Daniels III said the family decided to remove the statue to show support for the racial justice movement. He said it had been difficult for some older family members who knew Josephus Daniels personally and who feel like the decision has opened the family’s history up to public criticism.

But being in control of the process, allowing the family to move the statue somewhere private, has made it easier, Frank Daniels said.

“We’ve tried to make this a rational and logical step and not an emotional step,” he said. “The whole reason to be proactive was to take public emotion out of it and make it something private to the family. We would rather be seen as contributors to the conversation than reactors.”

In Sacramento, a statue of John Sutter, who settled in California during the gold rush and was said to have enslaved Native Americans, was recently removed from Sutter Medical Center after being vandalized.

Mr. Sutter’s great-great-grandson Ron Sutter, 72, said he understood why the hospital removed the statue but did not agree with the decision.

“I’m not into revisionist history,” Mr. Sutter said. “That being said, certain statues and monuments are considered insensitive, and I understand their removal.”

Frank Rizzo Jr. said Philadelphia’s move to take down a statue of his father, Frank Rizzo — a former mayor and police chief whom many saw as abusive toward black and gay people — was the result of politicians who were too willing to cave to a vocal minority.

He said that when the statue of his father was unveiled in the late 1990s, politicians of all stripes attended the ceremony.

“I don’t see anybody trying to stop this destruction,” Mr. Rizzo said of statues being removed in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. “I understand that these are tough times in the United States recently, but it’s to the point now where I think it’s getting out of control.”

Still, he said, taking down the statue of his father waving to constituents could not erase his memories.

“The people who care about Philadelphia,” he said, “will still remember Frank Rizzo, with a statue or without a statue.”

A Minneapolis Neighborhood Vowed to Check Its Privilege. It’s Already Being Tested.,"MINNEAPOLIS — When Shari Albers moved three decades ago into Powderhorn Park, a tree-lined Minneapolis neighborhood known as a haven to leftist activists and bohemian artists like herself, she went to work sprucing it up.

She became a block club leader, organizing her mostly white neighbors to bring in playgrounds and help tackle longstanding issues with crime.

On many nights, she banged on the car windows of men who had come to solicit prostitutes outside her door, she said. She kept meticulous notes when dozens of men would gather in a circle for gang meetings in the park across from her house. After each episode, she called the police.

But times have changed. After the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police, Ms. Albers, who is white, and many of her progressive neighbors have vowed to avoid calling law enforcement into their community. Doing so, they believed, would add to the pain that black residents of Minneapolis were feeling and could put them in danger.

Already, that commitment is being challenged. Two weeks ago, dozens of multicolored tents appeared in the neighborhood park. They were brought by homeless people who were displaced during the unrest that gripped the city. The multiracial group of roughly 300 new residents seems to grow larger and more entrenched every day. They do laundry, listen to music and strategize about how to find permanent housing. Some are hampered by mental illness, addiction or both.

Their presence has drawn heavy car traffic into the neighborhood, some from drug dealers. At least two residents have overdosed in the encampment and had to be taken away in ambulances.

The influx of outsiders has kept Ms. Albers awake at night. Though it is unlikely to happen, she has had visions of people from the tent camp forcing their way into her home. She imagines using a baseball bat to defend herself.

Not being able to call the police, as she has done for decades, has shaken her.

“I am afraid,” she said. “I know my neighbors are around, but I’m not feeling grounded in my city at all. Anything could happen.”

The video of Mr. Floyd’s death and the outcry over racial injustice that came after has awakened many white Americans to a reality that people of color have known their whole lives: The scores of police killings they have seen in the news in recent years were not one-off incidents, but part of a systemic problem of the dehumanization of black people by the police.

In the city where the movement began, residents are not surprised that it is being taken especially seriously in Powderhorn Park, just blocks from Mr. Floyd’s deadly encounter with the police. For decades, the community has been a refuge for scrappy working-class activists with far-left politics. The biggest day of the year, locals often boast, is the May Day parade celebrating laborers.

Though it is one of the most diverse neighborhoods in Minneapolis, with black residents making up about 17 percent of the population, white people make up the largest group. About a third of the population is Latino.

Since the camp appeared, the community has organized shifts for delivering warm meals, medical care and counseling to people living in the park. They persuaded officials to back off an eviction notice served shortly after the campers arrived.

But many in the neighborhood, who were already beleaguered from the financial stresses of the coronavirus, now say they are eager for the campers to move on to stable housing away from the park.

“I’m not being judgmental,” said Carrie Nightshade, 44, who explained that she no longer felt comfortable letting her children, 12 and 9, play in the park by themselves. “It’s not personal. It’s just not safe.”

On Friday, she sat in a shared backyard with four other women who live in neighboring houses. The women, four of whom are white, had called a meeting to vent about the camp.

Angelina Roslik burst into tears, explaining that she had spent the past four years fleeing unstable housing conditions and was struggling more than she cared to admit with the chaos the camp had brought into the neighborhood. Linnea Borden said she had stopped walking her dog through the park because she was tired of being catcalled. “My emotions change every 30 seconds,” said Tria Houser, who is part Native American.

The women agreed to let any property damage, including to their own homes, go ignored and to request a block party permit from the city to limit car traffic. Rather than turn to law enforcement if they saw anyone in physical danger, they resolved to call the American Indian Movement — a national organization created in 1968 to address Native American grievances such as police brutality — which had been policing its own community locally for years.

But some people in the neighborhood have already found their best-laid plans to avoid calling the police harder to execute than they had imagined.

Last Thursday night, Joseph Menkevich found a black man wearing a hospital bracelet passed out in the elevator of his apartment building two blocks away from the park. Mr. Menkevich, who is white, quickly phoned a community activist but she did not pick up. He felt he had no choice but to call 911, so he did, but requested an ambulance only, not the police.

Ultimately, a white police officer arrived at the scene. The officer checked the situation out briefly and then returned to his squad car.

“It didn’t resolve in a way that I had hoped,” Mr. Menkevich said. “All they did was offer to bring him back to the hospital. He refused, so they kicked him out on a rainy night.”

The impulse many white Powderhorn Park residents have to seek help from community groups rather than from the police is being felt in neighborhoods across the country. But some are finding the commitment hard to stand by when faced with the complex realities of life. While friends, neighbors and even family members in Powderhorn Park agree to avoid calling the police at all costs, it has been harder to establish where to draw the line.

Tobie Miller, Ms. Albers’s 34-year-old daughter, lives just a block away from her mother, but lately, she said, they have felt a world apart. Ms. Miller began a concerted effort last year to challenge her own privileges by taking a class on racial biases.

She worries that a lot of what has been written about the camp on community message boards has been influenced by racial profiling. To the extent that illegal activity is going on in the park, Ms. Miller does not blame the tent residents. “My feeling around it is those are symptoms of systemic oppression,” she said. “And that’s not on them.”

Some of the self-examination she and her mother have done recently has led them to the same place. Ms. Miller came to see her decision to buy a home in the neighborhood as potentially preventing a person of color from doing so. And while Ms. Albers used to feel only pride about the work she put in to revitalizing the community, now, she sees her work as gentrification that may have pushed out nonwhite residents. The neighborhood’s black population has dropped more than five percentage points since 2000.

Sheldon Stately Sr., 43, grew up in Powderhorn Park with his grandmother, one of the community’s few black homeowners at the time. He returned there recently in a tent. Mr. Stately said he had been homeless for three years after he could not make rent and lost his identification, which he could not afford to replace.

“I would like to get back working and feel better about my life,” he said.

On a recent afternoon, Sarah Kenney and Diane Cullumber, who are both white, were speedwalking behind their toddler sons through the park leading up to the camp. Ms. Kenney had been volunteering there a few times a week.

She said the experience had challenged her to consider not only the safety of her own family, which has a comfortable home and locked doors to retreat behind when they feel uncomfortable, but also that of people living outside without protection. Ms. Cullumber agreed.

Some people of color in the neighborhood, however, said they were skeptical that the community would allow the encampment to stay. “This thing is probably going to last two or three weeks,” said Aza Ochoa, a Mexican and Native American father who was walking through the park with his three children, 12, 11 and 6. Several Spanish-speaking members of the community said they had not been able to take part in collective discussions about the camp because they were in English.

Akhmiri Sekhr-Ra, a black woman who rented in Powderhorn Park for 10 years, said she was making plans to move back with her daughter. Though Ms. Sekhr-Ra said she had had a personal no-police policy for years, she questioned whether her white former neighbors would be able to stick to theirs. “If something really goes down that makes people uncomfortable, I think they’re going to call,” she said.

Mitchell Erickson’s fingers began dialing 911 last week before he had a chance to even consider alternatives, when two black teenagers who looked to be 15, at most, cornered him outside his home a block away from the park.

One of the boys pointed a gun at Mr. Erickson’s chest, demanding his car keys.

Flustered, Mr. Erickson handed over a set, but it turned out to be house keys. The teenagers got frustrated and ran off, then stole a different car down the street.

Mr. Erickson said later that he would not cooperate with prosecutors in a case against the boys. After the altercation, he realized that if there was anything he wanted, it was to offer them help. But he still felt it had been right to call the authorities because there was a gun involved.

Two days after an initial conversation, his position had evolved. “Been thinking more about it,” he wrote in a text message. “I regret calling the police. It was my instinct but I wish it hadn’t been. I put those boys in danger of death by calling the cops.”

What about the fact that the boys had put his life in danger?

“Yeah I know and yeah it was scary but the cops didn’t really have much to add after I called them,” he replied. “I haven’t been forced to think like this before. So I would have lost my car. So what? At least no one would have been killed.”"
Shooting in Seattle Raises Worries; Video Catches Calif. Sign Vandals,"This briefing has ended. Read the latest coverage here.

The protester-run district in Seattle known as the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone or the Capitol Hill Organized Protest area has been celebrated as a “no cop” zone where the community takes care of public safety. Since the city made the unusual decision last month to abandon a police station in the neighborhood, the police have largely stayed out to avoid clashing with the protesters, to the point of asking people who call for assistance, in all but the most serious situations, to meet them at the edge of the zone.

But the viability of that approach came into question after an eruption of gunfire inside the zone early Saturday, when one person died and another was critically injured.

Fire Department medics responding to the shooting stopped a block away, saying they needed to wait until the police declared the scene to be safe for them to enter. By the time the police tried to move in and do that, it appears that some 20 minutes had passed. Protesters expressed anger that the officers were there even though the first shooting victim had already been taken away by volunteer medics, who expressed frustration at the delay in getting aid.

A Seattle Police Department statement said that detectives were investigating the shooting “despite the challenges presented by the circumstances.” The police said that the suspect or suspects in the shooting had fled, and that the motive was unknown.

“Officers attempted to locate a shooting victim but were met by a violent crowd that prevented officers’ safe access to the victims,” the police statement said.

The city has been working to alter barricades surrounding in the zone to give access to emergency personnel access. But John Moore, 23, one of the volunteer medics on the scene early Saturday, said the Fire Department would not come in.

Instead, Mr. Moore said, the group planned to meet the Fire Department at a previously designated intersection outside of the zone. But after getting the wounded person in a truck while continuing CPR, the group arrived at the intersection to find nobody waiting there. So they continued to a hospital.

Videos posted on social media by Converge Media showed the volunteer medics racing through crowds of onlookers in the pre-dawn darkness. Tensions were high as some protesters appeared to object to the arrival of the police.

As armed officers in riot gear entered the zone, people screamed, “The victim left the premises!” At one point, protesters briefly surrounded a police car and then yelled, as the vehicle sped away, “Whose streets? Our streets!”

Gov. Jay Inslee said on Saturday that he was saddened to hear of a shooting and was still gathering information about what had occurred. But he said it was clear that the government needed to be able to provide protection for all citizens, including in that zone, and that “other options” might need to be explored.

“We have to have a way to provide police services and fire services in that area,” Mr. Inslee said.

Mike Solan, president of a police union representing more than 1,000 Seattle officers, said after the shootings that he feared for the safety of both law enforcement officers and the wider community because of the hostility of the protesters toward the police.

“The community is at grave risk, and the men and the women that provide that public safety service, they’re at grave risk as well,” Mr. Solan said on KIRO-TV, The Associated Press reported. 

Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta, whose city has been rocked by the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man, Rayshard Brooks, said on Sunday that at least nine officers had resigned from the police force in the past week. 

“Our communities are hurting and our officers are hurting,” Ms. Bottoms said in an interview on the CNN program “State of the Union.” “So in the same way our demonstrators need an opportunity to vent and to express their frustration and their concern, understand that our officers need the opportunity to do that as well.” 

The officer who shot Mr. Brooks was swiftly fired and now faces criminal charges including murder. The other officer at the scene has been put on administrative leave and also faces some charges. The city’s police chief resigned the day after the shooting. 

Police union officials and others have complained about what they called a rush to judgment in the case, and unusually large numbers of officers have been calling in sick or have otherwise been absent from work since the charges were announced. 

The interim chief of the department, Rodney Bryant, told reporters on Saturday that “the explanation for calling out sick vary, and include officers questioning their training, officers being challenged and attacked, and unease about officers seeing their colleagues criminally charged so quickly,” according to Fox 5 Atlanta.

Ms. Bottoms said on Sunday that she was focused now on training police officers in de-escalation techniques to prevent any repeat of the deadly encounter with Mr. Brooks. 

She expressed frustration that President Trump did not say anything substantive at his campaign rally in Tulsa, Okla., Saturday about the weeks of protests against police brutality and systemic racism around the country, including those in Atlanta following the killing of Mr. Brooks.

“It was absolutely what the nation does not need right now,” she said of Mr. Trump’s speech. “He did not speak about healing. He did not recognize any of the racial tensions that are happening.”

It’s a call often heard from proponents of systemic changes in law enforcement: that cases involving police misconduct be handled by an outside prosecutor and not by the local district attorney’s office, which depends on close cooperation with the police and may have a cozy relationship with them. 

But after weeks of protests over police violence and racism, leading to increased scrutiny and swift prosecution of officers involved in killings, calls for independent prosecutors are coming from the other side — supporters of the police.

In Georgia, Rep. Doug Collins, a Republican, has called for a special prosecutor to be appointed to handle the case against the two white Atlanta police officers charged in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man, Rayshard Brooks, on June 12. 

One officer, Garrett Rolfe, was dismissed from the police force the day after the shooting, and was charged on Wednesday with 11 crimes including murder and aggravated assault. The other, Devin Brosnan, was charged with three crimes including aggravated assault. 

Mr. Collins said in a statement on Thursday that moving so quickly to charge the officers — before the Georgia Bureau of Investigation had completed its investigation of the case — was “a political decision, not a legal one,” and demanded that the case be taken away from Paul L. Howard Jr., the Fulton County district attorney.

“I’m calling on Attorney General Chris Carr to appoint an independent district attorney in the case of Rayshard Brooks to ensure Georgians have complete confidence that this case is devoid of any and all political influence,” Mr. Collins said. “If a special prosecutor was warranted in the Ahmaud Arbery case, then it certainly warrants the appointment of one here,” the statement read.

Mr. Arbery, a 25-year-old black man, was chased and gunned down by a group of armed white men near Brunswick, Ga. The men were civilians, not police officers. Though their identities were known, no arrests were made for several months after the killing, and federal officials were asked to step in after local prosecutors recused themselves from the investigation.

In the case that first touched off the wave of protests around the country, the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota took the case away from the local district attorney and assigned it to the state attorney general, Keith Ellison, a former Democratic congressman and civil rights lawyer. Soon afterward, Mr. Ellison brought additional charges against the officers accused in the case.

Scenes from the protests over racism and police violence that have erupted across the country.

Staff members at the jail holding Derek Chauvin, the white former Minneapolis officer charged with murder in the killing of George Floyd, say that only white employees were allowed to guard him when he was first brought to the facility.

Eight officers have filed complaints against the Ramsey County jail, saying that its superintendent kept them from bringing Mr. Chauvin to his cell — or even being on the same floor — when he was booked at the jail last month, and that it was done solely because of their race.

The officers, half of whom are black and all of whom are people of color, said the orders from the superintendent, Steve Lydon, amounted to segregation, and implied that they could not be trusted to do their jobs because they were not white.

After initially denying that jail staff had been segregated, a spokesman for the Ramsey County Sheriff’s Office said this weekend that Mr. Lydon had been removed from the superintendent post as the sheriff investigates the officers’ claims.

The spokesman, Roy Magnuson, provided a statement that he said Mr. Lydon gave to investigators, in which Mr. Lydon says he acted out of concern that having nonwhite guards interact with Mr. Chauvin could have “heightened ongoing trauma,” and that after 45 minutes he realized that he had erred, reversed the order and apologized.

The discrimination claims, first reported by The Star Tribune, were the latest instance in which correctional officials have been accused of giving preferential treatment to a white inmate. One of the officers said in his complaint that a white lieutenant had also let Mr. Chauvin use her phone inside his jail cell, a violation of the jail’s policy. Mr. Magnuson declined to say anything about that claim.

A black sergeant said in an interview that he was in charge of booking on May 29 when Mr. Chauvin was brought to the jail, and that after he had patted Mr. Chauvin down, Mr. Lydon told him to have no more contact with Mr. Chauvin, and asked him who could transport the fired officer instead. When the sergeant pointed to two white officers, Mr. Lydon seemed satisfied, the sergeant said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he fears retaliation from other law enforcement officers.

The sergeant and other officers said they were also kept from transporting an uncooperative person up to the fifth floor about an hour later because Mr. Chauvin was being held there. The sergeant said they had to wait until there were enough white officers to bring the inmate to the fifth floor, a special housing unit where high-profile, uncooperative and suicidal people are held. 

In passionate debate over removing Confederate symbols across the South, one of the most conspicuous holdouts is the state of Mississippi, which has the battle flag of Robert E. Lee’s rebel army prominently embedded in its state flag and has resisted efforts to change it for decades. 

But with Confederate statues and other monuments with racist associations now being toppled across the country in the wave of Black Lives Matter protests, the debate over the Mississippi flag has gathered new momentum.

“This is the time we’re going to get this done,” said the Rev. Darren Leach, the senior pastor at Genesis Church in Columbus, Miss., near the Alabama state line. “It’s a good chance for the good people of Mississippi to just do what they know they should do: Get us out from under this blight. The flag is a blight.”

The pressure has ratcheted up in recent weeks as forces outside Mississippi have denounced the flag. 

The National Collegiate Athletic Association announced on Friday that it will not host any championship events in states where the Confederate battle flag is a prominent, sanctioned symbol. The day before, the Southeastern Conference made a similar threat; two of its 14 members are the University of Mississippi and Mississippi State. 

Business leaders have also been vocal about the flag being an economic liability in a state that is already one of the poorest in the country. 

The flag is deeply polarizing in the state. A referendum to change it failed overwhelmingly in 2001, but one poll taken this month found that supporters and opponents are now in a statistical tie, broken largely on racial and partisan lines. And in recent weeks, many in the Republican-dominated State Legislature have signaled a willingness to see it changed. 

A survey of lawmakers conducted last week by Mississippi Today, a nonprofit news organization, found that 63 members of the House and Senate wanted the legislature to change the flag; seven wanted to keep the flag; and 51 from both houses wanted voters to decide the issue.

Defenders of the flag have also mobilized, calling the challenge to the flag an assault on their history and culture by left-wing radicals. “This is not about a flag,” Chris McDaniel, a Republican state senator, said in a Facebook live video for his supporters. “It’s about finally and firmly saying no.” 





The Black Lives Matter sign that a college student hung on a fence outside his parents’ home in Thousand Oaks, Calif., was repeatedly vandalized. So he put up a surveillance video camera that the authorities said caught at least three people in the act — including two who work in law enforcement.

The Ventura County Sheriff’s Office said it recognized one of its employees, Darrin Stone, 60, in footage posted online of a man ripping through the sign with a knife. He was arrested on Friday and cited for vandalism, a misdemeanor, the sheriff’s office said. Mr. Stone could not be reached for comment on Sunday.

Sheriff Bill Ayub said in a statement that his department “will not tolerate unlawful or unethical behavior.”

“I’m deeply disappointed that one of our employees involved himself in this type of illegal activity, especially when this is an infringement on someone’s First Amendment right to freedom of speech,” he said. 

Another man spotted in video footage cutting and attempting to remove the sign, the Sheriff’s Office said, was an investigative assistant with the Ventura County District Attorney’s Office. The man, identified as Craig Anderson, 59, was also arrested and cited for vandalism.

The District Attorney’s Office said in a statement on Saturday that Mr. Anderson had resigned after working in the office for four months. Because of Mr. Anderson’s status as a former employee, the statement said, his misdemeanor citation would be referred to the state Attorney General’s Office. Mr. Anderson could not be reached on Sunday.

The third man arrested, Jeffrey Moore, was accused of spray-painting the sign on June 11. The Sheriff’s Office said it tracked him down using the company name and phone number that were “prominently displayed” on his work truck, seen in the video.

The Black Lives Matter sign was posted by Max Meyers, 19, a student at University of California, Santa Barbara, who has been staying at home because of the coronavirus outbreak. He said he put up a sign in the same spot last year to support firefighters during the California wildfires, and that it stayed up for more than three months without being damaged.

But on Saturday night, he said,his Black Lives Matter sign was vandalized again.

[shouting] “We would call them bike hikes. We were just going out to go explore your world.” “It would be at least six, seven, eight of us. Our parents said as long as you were home before the streetlights came on, you stayed as a group, you’re fine.” “It was a beautiful day, sunshine. The children in the neighborhood planned to go on a trip to McDonald’s just to have some fun, something different to do.” “Rosedale we thought was a safe place. We all went down. We were riding our bikes.” “And then we saw down the block that there was this beautiful American flag flowing in the wind.” “We saw a group outside on the block. So we was like, ‘Oh, this is a block party.’” “The last thing that I remember was someone saying, ‘Oh, a parade.’ And so we went down to go see the parade, and I laugh about it to this day because it was a parade to get the black people out of Rosedale.” Crowd: “White power — white resistance.” It’s the summer of 1975. White residents in Rosedale, Queens, are protesting black families moving into the neighborhood. [shouting] Crowd: “Equal rights for whites.” These are scenes from a documentary produced by journalist Bill Moyers. “Does he have a right to live here?” “No.” “Why not?” “Because he’s black.” “This was not the South. This was not Greenville, Miss., or Spartanburg, S.C., or Atlanta, Ga. This was right in the heart of the greatest metropolitan area in the country.” The documentary was found nearly 45 years later by a graduate student who posted a short clip on the internet. It went viral on Twitter and Facebook. And the question people kept asking, where are the kids now? “Hey, Rob, this is Whitney Hurst calling from The New York Times. My name is Whitney Hurst. I’m a journalist —” To answer that question, we called more than 90 people who had lived in Rosedale at that time. “I’m just trying to find anyone that might have known someone.” We couldn’t find any white residents who said they’d been there. “Came out because it got a little bit crazy.” But we spoke with several of the black children. We wanted to hear what happened to them that day to understand why their experience is resonating decades later. “We went down to see what was going on. Probably in the middle of the block, that’s when we figured out it was something else, and it was something that we definitely were not invited to.” “We noticed that they were running towards us. I was like, ‘Wow.’ You know, like, ‘Why are they rushing towards us,’ not thinking anything negative. And then we heard nigger.” [crowd shouting racial slurs] “Yeah, nigger!” “And they surrounded my best friend at the time, Lorena — one of the young men hit her, and they started calling us names. They started throwing rocks.” “Hearing the word, hearing it directed at me — ‘Why are you calling me that? That’s not me.’ You know, I’ve always been told that’s not me. I didn’t understand. I was like, ‘Who do you think you are to say we can’t come here?’ Like, how dare you?” “What happened to you?” “This little boy, he threw the rock. He tried to hit my sister, but he almost hit me. It was about that much away from me. And I sure wish he had hit me with that rock. I would pick up the rock right next to me and hit him right dead in his face.” “I was just kind of amazed to see that people can act like that, to tell you the truth. But that was like really the first when I was like, ‘Wow, people do not like black people.’” “They always do that. They always spit on us like we some dogs. They always —” “Spit back on them.” “Ain’t nothing going to change.” “I immediately was reminded of those programs my parents would have me watch with the dogs and the hoses, and people trying to vote and being killed and lynched. It just, it went right back to my history in this country. It just linked me immediately with that whole experience because I felt it.” “Do you forgive them?” “No. No. No. Can’t take back no hurt.” “And I didn’t know what to do with those feelings. I did not know what to do with those feelings.” For Moyers, the video going viral shows how powerful images can be. “He just tried to hit my sister, but —” “Because we were in their neighborhood.” “I mean, I do believe that television has been a great teacher. This country didn’t really respond to what was going on in the South, although it was well known, until the sheriff in Birmingham turned the water hoses and the dogs on those young people who were demonstrating there. We knew about it. We heard about it. We were aware of it, but we didn’t see it. We couldn’t escape it once we saw it.” “As we filmed in Rosedale, a group of blacks from South Jamaica was coming through the neighborhood in a demonstration of support.” “Every time a group of blacks get together, they want to help Rosedale with their problems. We don’t need any outsiders helping us with our problems, and we’ll stay white, period.” Crowd: “Right on. Right on.” “All right, so guys, this next scene is very disturbing, all right? It’s the one I was telling you about yesterday. I started a sociology elective in 2004-2005 school year, and my supervisor at the time said, ‘Come up with something that’s close to home that maybe you can relate to today.’ I grew up in Rosedale.” “… and think that I have a right —” “And I said, ‘I want to do a unit on race in America.’ And that Rosedale video, we’ve been showing it for 15 years now, giving it to the kids and say, ‘What do you think?’” “I’ve never seen racism on camera. That was full-on racism and just bullying.” Crowd: “Equal rights for whites. Equal rights for whites.” “I’m glad that I saw it because it needs to be seen. I feel like everyone should see this.” “I think it’s come back up because of the fact that we’re going back kind of.” “Racism is still alive. It’s still poisoning other minds.” “This is how it was back then. Let’s not repeat it again.” “Emotionally, I think it’s connecting with kids more today. This generation is that ‘I Generation.’ They can see it in a 10-second span, make a connection to it.” “Can’t take back no hurt.” “The kids are never going to forget that. They can’t unsee it, and it’s going to be with them forever.” “Rosedale, it’s turned predominately black now, so we’re welcomed there now. That day, the American flag was the image, the symbol that pulled us into that situation. We live in America. The American flag means good things. It means that we can go where we want to go. We can ride our bike down any street in America. But it really represented a symbol of do not enter. So they took that beautiful image and turned it into something ugly for me, and I want the flag back.”

The video rolls on a sunny suburban street, and a group of black children bike toward what looks to them like a parade — there’s a small crowd, and an American flag. Suddenly, they’re swarmed by a group of white children, who hurl racial epithets and rocks. Grown-ups who are gathered nearby do nothing.

The black children had bicycled straight into a white supremacist rally.

The scene captured in 1975 by “Bill Moyers Journal,” a PBS documentary series, has echoes of the racist clashes more than a decade earlier in places like Selma and Birmingham, Ala., and Little Rock, Ark. But it unfolded in New York City, in the bedroom community of Rosedale, Queens, nearly a dozen years after the Civil Rights Act was made law.

Forty-five years later, that virulent 2 minute 20 second snippet of the documentary, “Rosedale: The Way It Is,” resurfaced online, shared by a graduate student, and raced across the internet. Its quietly forgotten subject, a rash of firebombings of black families’ homes in Queens, upended for a new generation the city’s narrative as a bastion of tolerance.

And it shocked the children, even then: “I never even knew people were like that,” one of the black girls says after the attack in 1975 as the documentarian films her, with her pigtailed friend looking on. “I’ve never experienced anything like that in my life.”

In recent weeks, the city’s story line of a utopian melting pot has been further punctured as New York heaves with unrest over the systemic racism black people face, and the video has again gone viral. 

Monmouth University in New Jersey said it would remove Woodrow Wilson’s name from its most prominent building, after administrators, professors and students said Wilson held abhorrent views on race and reinstituted segregation in the federal work force when he was president.

The decision contrasted with a vote by Princeton University’s trustees in 2016 to keep Wilson’s name on campus buildings and programs there, despite student protests that led to a review of his legacy. Wilson was president of Princeton before he entered politics. 

The building at Monmouth, a 1929 stone mansion considered the crown jewel of the campus, was named for Wilson in 1966, and the university’s trustees voted in 2016 to keep the name. But in the four years since, “the context has changed,” Monmouth’s president, Patrick F. Leahy, said on Saturday.

“Wilson was a controversial politician, and I think it has heightened awareness in 2020 about some of his racist policies,” he said.

Wilson is perhaps best known today for his role in peace negotiations after World War I and as the architect of the League of Nations, the precursor to the U.N. But historians, including some at Monmouth, have said that Wilson believed strongly in white supremacy and appointed many racists to his cabinet, who moved quickly to resegregate their departments, demoting and firing many black people.

“He was behind his own times on race and many scholars have concluded that,” said Hettie V. Williams, an assistant professor of African-American history at Monmouth. 

When Princeton decided In 2016 not to remove Wilson’s name from its programs and buildings, despite a student sit-in to protest racial injustice, the university’s president, Christopher L. Eisgruber, said the trustees had concluded that the best way to pursue diversity and inclusion “is not by tearing down names from the past but rather being more honest about our history, including the bad parts of our history.”

In Camden, N.J., officials announced they planned to rename Woodrow Wilson High School, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. “Our students will walk into a new building not tied to a building with a racist legacy,” said Camden’s schools superintendent, Katrina McCombs.

Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina, said on Sunday that his party’s police reform bill will focus on leveraging federal money to push police departments to change.

“It is important for us to use the resources that we provide to law enforcement to compel them toward the direction that we think is in the best interest of the nation,” he said on the ABC program “This Week.”

Departments that do not institute the changes called for in the bill would not receive as much federal grant money, he said.

But he added that more money, not less, was needed to fulfill the bill’s goals.

“We believe that you actually need more resources, not less resources,” he said. “If you want officers to be trained effectively, you have to give them the tools, called training. If you want more information on the federal level, that requires more resources for record keeping and for data collection.”

The bill, led by Mr. Scott, calls for more departments to submit information about their officers, like complaints against them, to a federal database.

“There’s a lot of accountability,” he said. “The only way to get to that root of the problem is to have as much information collected by the F.B.I. Today, only about 40 percent of offices actually report their information. For us to see the patterns in law enforcement that may be problematic, we need all the information.”

Friday was a paid company holiday for Nike employees in 2020. The same was true for workers at Twitter, Target, General Motors, the National Football League and a variety of other businesses. JPMorgan Chase, Capital One and other banks closed branches early.

Companies big and small decided to recognize Juneteenth, a holiday that commemorates the end of slavery, after the killing of George Floyd set off an urgent national conversation about race.

Companies are usually quiet at moments of public upheaval, and hesitant to take a political stand for fear of alienating customers. But since the death of Mr. Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis late last month, businesses of all kinds have expressed their solidarity with protesters, donated millions of dollars to organizations dedicated to racial justice or vowed to change their office cultures to be more inclusive.

Some, though, have gone beyond those steps, announcing intentions to make concrete changes inside their own institutions or in how they do business.

‘Power to the People’: Detroit Students Preserve This Moment in Paint,"DETROIT — Rochelle Riley knows her city probably won’t look the same after this moment of uprising — and she wants to make sure of it.

“This is permanent, it’s not just for a holiday or an action this week,” Ms. Riley, the director of Detroit’s art and culture department, said Wednesday morning as she looked up Woodward Avenue while a crew of more than 30 artists and students maneuvered paint rollers over pavement. They were creating a huge mural on the street, a white-and-black message that read “Power to the People,” with the center of the “o” in the word “Power” represented by a raised fist. “And we’re looking to do more around the city,” Ms. Riley added.

As people nationwide come together to protest police brutality and racial injustice, their counterparts in Detroit wanted to say, in a big and bold way, that this period of civil unrest was different.

In Washington, “Black Lives Matter” has been painted in huge yellow letters on 16th Street near the White House. Other cities have added their own versions: “End Racism Now” in Raleigh, N.C.; “Black Austin Matters” in Austin, Texas. In Flint, Mich., activists, students and artists from the Flint Public Art Project helped the city become the first in the state to invest in street art, using funding from the city’s Community Foundation to paint “Black Lives Matter” in big white letters on a block of Martin Luther King Avenue leading into town.

“The message for us was just unity,” said Joe Schipani, the executive director of the Flint Art Project. “The community always comes together to support everybody. That’s just what Flint does.”

In Detroit, officials sponsored a contest, soliciting artists to come up with a mural suited to the city’s population and history. Thirty-five artists submitted proposals, and a group of students from Detroit schools voted on their favorite. The students then showed up to help paint the mural on Woodward, the main thoroughfare that starts at the Detroit River and runs through the city and its northern suburbs.

Jaanaki Radhakrishnan, 15, works at the Detroit Institute of Arts during the summer and was one of the 30 high school students who picked up paint rollers and gingerly filled in the letters marked out in blue painter’s tape. She said she thought the political climate demanded that the government take action.

“A lot of the times, it really doesn’t feel like the government or the police are there to serve us,” she said. “And this is an important message to remind us and our government that we, as the people, hold all the power.”

The mural — whose $10,000 to $12,000 cost was picked up by a coalition of nonprofit groups and local businesses — seemed to her almost a promise to the people of Detroit.

Hubert Massey, the winner of the mural contest and an acclaimed artist who has public art installations across the city, agreed, saying the mural represented a pledge by Detroiters to keep up the fight for social justice and equality.

“This is Detroit, and to me it represents the city wholeheartedly,” he said. “We went through the ’67 riots and this resonates for the people here.”

In those 1967 clashes, incited by the police’s treatment of black people, 43 people died and more than 2,000 buildings were destroyed. “We’re still internalizing Black Lives Matter,” Mr. Massey said, “but it’s power to the people that is giving people strength and hope and inspiring change.”

Mr. Massey, a lifelong Detroiter who was 9 when the riots roiled the city, said there was never a question that this would be the message he would submit. It came to him quickly: Artists had only a couple of days to submit their plans, and he recalled the John Lennon song, recorded in the years after the riots as an anthem of empowerment and protest.

It fits in well with the rest of his murals, frescos, mosaics and sculptures in the city, which represent the diversity, culture and history of Detroit.

Sirrita Darby, 28, the executive director of the youth activist group Detroit Heals Detroit, brought 10 teenagers to help with the project. She wanted them to contribute to a lasting piece of art.

“We’ve been to so many protests, and this is just a different form of protest,” she said. “We thought that Detroit is one of the blackest cities in America, so we should be next” to get a street mural, Ms. Darby added. “I asked the city how long this would be here, and they said it could be years. This reminds people of what they need to do to be a part of the movement.”

Public art has been growing in the city since Mayor Mike Duggan, a Democrat, transitioned from aggressively ticketing, and even arresting, some graffiti artists to encouraging them to create murals on buildings.

“It’s been a very positive initiative and a great expression of our community,” Mr. Duggan said of the murals that continue to sprout up around the city.

This moment of unrest and reckoning is changing the Detroit landscape in more ways than the Woodward Avenue mural. Ms. Riley, the city art and culture director, wants to paint more of them. And on Monday, Mr. Duggan ordered a bust of Christopher Columbus, which has been outside City Hall for 110 years, removed and put into storage.

“I’ve been bothered for a while that the statue has occupied such a place of prominence,” the mayor said. “We should have a conversation as a community as to what is the appropriate place for such a statue.”"
Qualified Immunity Protection for Police Emerges as Flash Point Amid Protests,"WASHINGTON — Long before the death of George Floyd set off a nationwide uproar over police brutality, before protests erupted in 2014 over the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., a 50-year-old man named Wayne Jones took a night stroll through the streets of Martinsburg, W.Va.

A police officer saw Mr. Jones walking illegally in the road that night in 2013 and asked whether he was carrying a weapon. Mr. Jones, who had a small knife, and the police got into a tussle, after which one officer accused Mr. Jones of stabbing him. Fifteen minutes later, Mr. Jones lay on the ground facedown between a stone wall and five officers, who had fired 22 bullets at his backside.

Mr. Jones’s brothers, Robert and Bruce, have tried for years to hold the police accountable for Wayne’s death but have repeatedly run into hurdles: Most recently, the officers claimed they could not be held liable under so-called qualified immunity, an esoteric legal doctrine invoked by police departments across the country for decades in response to allegations of excessive force. It provides legal protections for officers when they are accused of violating others’ constitutional rights.

Once a little-known rule, qualified immunity has emerged as a flash point in the protests spurred by Mr. Floyd’s killing and galvanized calls for police reform. In the vast majority of cases of police brutality, officers are never criminally prosecuted. For families of victims seeking some sort of relief through the justice system, qualified immunity presents another obstacle to obtaining financial or other damages. Even in the rare cases where the officers are charged, as in Mr. Floyd’s death, the police can still claim qualified immunity if relatives or victims sue them.

“Every time across the country that I hear of a new case, I see a news report of another victim, it just opens up the wounds again,” Robert Jones said. “It makes it feel like it just happened yesterday.”

Activists have seized on qualified immunity as what they see as one of the biggest problems with policing and argued that it shields officers from being held accountable in cases of misconduct. Police leaders said it was essential for officers’ ability to respond to calls and to make split-second decisions.

Qualified immunity is a focal point of the new debate on Capitol Hill over how to address systemic racism in policing and use of excessive force. House Democrats unveiled a bill that would allow victims of police brutality to seek damages from their assailants. A competing Senate Republican bill made no mention of qualified immunity, and the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, called it a “total and complete nonstarter.”

State legislatures have taken up the issue as well. The Colorado General Assembly became the first to eliminate qualified immunity this month.

“It’s a message that’s sent in these cases — that officers can violate people’s rights with impunity,” said Joanna Schwartz, a professor of law at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has written extensively on the doctrine. “That is outrageous to people and causing people to act.”

In 1967, amid another era marked by civil rights protests, the Supreme Court introduced qualified immunity to protect government officials acting in good faith — not just police officers — from financial liability. In a case involving clergy members who said they were wrongfully arrested on charges of breach of peace for entering a whites-only bus terminal waiting room, the justices argued that if officers were personally held responsible for their misconduct, it might deter them from performing their duties and making arrests.

The court expanded the protection in ensuing decades, and it now covers “all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law,” a rationale offered by the Supreme Court in 1986 in an unlawful arrest case.

As a result, victims and families accusing police officers of brutality must find a virtually identical case where officers were held responsible to cite as precedent in cases where officers claim qualified immunity.

Since Mr. Brown’s shooting death by a white officer in 2014 and protests over it prompted a national conversation about racism and police brutality, both liberal and conservative justices have expressed doubts about the doctrine. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in 2018 that the doctrine “tells officers that they can shoot first and think later, and it tells the public that palpably unreasonable conduct will go unpunished.”

When the Supreme Court declined last week to take up several cases concerning qualified immunity, Justice Clarence Thomas, the lone dissenting voice, expressed “strong doubts” about the doctrine.

Critics have accused the court of arbitrarily contriving it. At a House Judiciary Committee hearing last week, Representative Jerrold R. Nadler, Democrat of New York and the committee chairman, said that before qualified immunity was “invented” by the Supreme Court, “the world did not fall in.”

David Cole, the national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed one of the petitions rejected by the Supreme Court last week, called the doctrine “a free pass” for police officers “to violate constitutional rights without being held to account.”

Though the doctrine is intended to protect officers from paying for the damages they cause, he said the result is that officers are more likely to abuse their powers. “Fiscal concerns are overriding concerns about justice and police accountability,” Mr. Cole added.

Advocates on behalf of the police insisted that qualified immunity was necessary for officers to protect the public. Its protections allow officers to make life-or-death decisions in a matter of seconds, they said, and without it, fewer people might be willing to join police forces.

Bill Johnson, the executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, said critics of qualified immunity were seizing on the moment to attack a doctrine that had little to do with the widely condemned deaths of Mr. Floyd and Rayshard Brooks, who was shot to death this month by the police in a Wendy’s parking lot in Atlanta, and unfairly targeting the police.

The doctrine does not apply in criminal cases like those pending against the officers involved in the death of Mr. Floyd. Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, was recorded on video pinning Mr. Floyd to the ground for nearly nine minutes as Mr. Floyd protested that he could not breathe. Mr. Chauvin was charged with second-degree murder, and the other three officers involved were charged with aiding and abetting in Mr. Floyd’s death. None has entered a plea in court.

“The proponents looking at qualified immunity are kind of cynically taking advantage of a horrific situation to change the law in a different area that does not apply to that area at all,” Mr. Johnson said.

But the charges in the deaths of Mr. Floyd and Mr. Brooks are anomalies. According to Mapping Police Violence, a group that collects data on police shootings, of the 1,147 people killed by the police in 2017, officers were charged with a crime in 13 of the cases, or about 1 percent.

In the vast majority of cases where officers are not charged, victims can pursue justice only in the form of financial or other damages through lawsuits. Qualified immunity can block them from obtaining relief.

Republicans in Congress have rejected any change to the broad protection afforded to police officers. Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina, who sponsored his party’s bill, called Democrats’ effort to eliminate qualified immunity a “poison pill.” Republicans’ policing bill would create incentives for departments to use body cameras and ban chokeholds as well as create a system to track misconduct.

Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, did signal an openness to revisiting the doctrine at a committee meeting last week. “Maybe there’s something we can do with the concept of qualified immunity that would put more accountability into the agencies that run police departments,” he suggested.

Another Republican senator, Mike Braun of Indiana, introduced legislation Tuesday that would change how qualified immunity was applied. Under his proposal, officers could claim the protection only under two conditions: when their conduct had been legally authorized or required or if a court found that it did not violate the Constitution or federal laws.

Wayne Jones’s family won a small victory this month when the federal Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the officers involved in his killing could not claim qualified immunity. Noting that the F.B.I. had just begun investigating Mr. Floyd’s killing, the court wrote, “This has to stop.”

Mr. Jones’s relatives are awaiting a decision from the West Virginia Supreme Court about whether they are entitled to see secret testimony given to the grand jury that voted not to indict the officers and whether they are entitled to a new grand jury altogether to investigate the case anew.

Seven years later, Quakers and other groups in the area host monthly vigils for Mr. Jones. And for his brother Robert, the feeling of loss is still fresh. He never watched the footage of his brother’s killing in full, but he mustered up the courage to watch the final minutes of Mr. Floyd’s life. It brought him to tears, and he said that protections for officers, like qualified immunity, are to blame in the deaths.

“It’s like a thief,” he said. “If you keep letting the thief get away with it, he’s going to keep on doing it. If you keep letting these people kill and harass and hurt people, they’re going to keep on doing it.”"
"In This Pandemic, Personal Echoes of the AIDS Crisis","This article is part of our latest Pride special report, featuring L.G.B.T.Q. voices on the challenges and possibilities of these troubled times.

Alexander Chee is the author of “How to Write an Autobiographical Novel” and “Queen of the Night.”

The first weekend of the coronavirus shutdown in March, my husband, Dustin, and I made calls to family and friends to discuss our plans. Most of them were already adjusting to the idea of a pandemic unlike any we had seen before, but it was already feeling like one I had seen before. “I’m used to not doing everything I want to save myself from a virus, and they are not,” Dustin said.

I wasn’t alone in feeling an immediate parallel. This virus is not that virus, some of my fellow AIDS activist veterans wrote in those first weeks, trying to make room for each virus to have its own identity and history. Absolutely, I agreed, even though I kept feeling the undertow.

This virus is not that virus. But this country is still that country.

The understanding that we were sheltering in place because this was our best chance at surviving our health care system’s ability to respond to the coronavirus felt like a distinct crisis from the older one I knew. But after a trip to the grocery store, while separating the items that needed washing, I found the spray bottle of bleach solution the cashier used to wipe down the counter in my bags — in the chaos, she had included it. As I walked with it to the bathroom to wash it, I had a 30-year-old memory of a walk from my bedroom to my bathroom in my old apartment in San Francisco, to dispose of a condom, conjured by the fear that an unseen virus was on an object in my home.

Soon the parallels were more direct: a president confronting an epidemic with ideology and not science; Anthony Fauci on my television screen; conservatives scapegoating Asians the way they once did gay people — but also, a way they had scapegoated Asians historically. Sometimes they seemed out of a satirical novel: The people determined to hold religious services now were many of the same Christians who in the 1980s feared they might get AIDS from sharing a communion cup. And there was dystopian half-rhyme: Celebrities came out as having the virus to destigmatize it — but this signaled they had access to testing before the public did.

When I read about how one of the early obstacles to manufacturing tests for the coronavirus was that drug companies feared there was no money in it, I remembered the many Act Up demonstrations demanding drug companies expand their research and make new drugs accessible, as their executives had feared there was no money in producing AIDS drugs.

And so I asked myself: Were these parallels in the nature of the viruses, or just an old story about America that had never changed?

Two months into lockdown, while checking in with an old friend from Act Up San Francisco, he described his reaction to the rapidly rising number of deaths. “I’m acknowledging them, but I’m not feeling them, just like the old days,” he wrote. “That comes later.” I stared at the sentences, glowing in the dark, in recognition.

We had met in 1989, and I once told him getting old while H.I.V. positive was one of the most-punk rock things he ever did, though the list is long. “What they’re all experiencing in three months is what we lived through for years,” he added. “I’m still alive though,” he said; he’s been saying this for decades, a mutual benchmark of success for many of us.

When Dustin contracted what was likely Covid-19 six weeks later, my Act Up network provided information about the disease and his care. And when I felt our doctors were failing us, telling us only that “we didn’t meet the criteria for testing,” and acting as if we were trying to cheat our way into being tested, I thought of Larry Kramer, an Act Up founder, as I demanded from them, loudly, to be cared for.

When Mr. Kramer died three months into the shutdown, I mourned him by reading some of his work and found his historic 1983 essay, “1,112 and Counting.” Back then, that was an alarming number of people. It was also just slightly less than the number of new coronavirus infections in New York City alone the night before he died, May 26 — a decline. And it is just slightly less than the number of people killed by police last year in America, according to the research group Mapping Police Violence. The ones we are able to count.

This was also the night after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

“Health care is a right” was an Act Up slogan before it was a Democratic Party platform plank. Many of my friends in the group went into public health to make the changes needed to save lives. I have written before about how AIDS activists who did this work don’t get enough credit for having tried, during those first days and all the days after, to tell Americans that our health care system was potentially as deadly as the epidemic it failed to control.

Despite an internally contentious history, Act Up became a model for how a movement sustained continued work and mobilization, work that sometimes took decades. Much of mainstream policy now around substance abuse, touch hunger and viral transmission comes from the work of these activists. These same activists are now offering their expertise, in online sessions and in writing, about strategies for harm reduction while meeting social needs during an epidemic. The practices of safer sex can inform us on everything from going to the grocery store to creating a pod — a group of people you trust enough to live with or see regularly — to going to work.

AIDS activists and L.G.B.T.Q. people in general are still treated as if AIDS happened to only us. The AIDS epidemic has spread around the globe and killed millions because of neglect and misinformation — and you, like me, have also lived through it. If you didn’t know this, it is because it was made invisible to you, perhaps even by you, if you ever believed AIDS didn’t or couldn’t affect you.

In 1995, after Act Up’s advocacy with drug companies and publicly funded research resulted in the release of the anti-viral drug cocktail that saved so many lives, the AIDS crisis was then declared “over” in the late 1990s by too many influential voices — even as it expanded around the world, affecting communities that often didn’t have access to these drugs.

Thirty-four years later, some of the anti-viral drugs used to treat AIDS and protect from H.I.V. are even now being tested on coronavirus patients, with limited success. There are finally enough people with AIDS for drug companies to make drugs for them. Is this now already true for coronavirus? It seems so. We have reached the part of the script where too many of our officials have decided the danger is past us, and the country moves on, to both greater harm and further invisibility for those harmed.

The first years of the AIDS crisis feel to me like just a dress rehearsal for this intentional lack of care. As the many Black Lives Matter demonstrations, rightly being called a national uprising, spread to nearly every part of the country and communities around the world, I am reminded, of course, of how Act Up came to be. Many other countries have mobilized against the disease the way American government has mobilized to shut down the protests. I recognize police tactics I remember from the first times they were used against me, even as I see new ones. But the clearest echoes of 1987 visible are in the systemic corruption targeted by Black Lives Matter, the immunity from accountability that white supremacy needs to operate.

Coronavirus infections had already exploded in states that have reopened, even before these protests that many worry are also spreading the virus. But protesters are risking their lives because staying home the way things are now effectively means giving up on those lives. Black Lives Matter and its partners are responding to the police killings and the pandemic, which affected communities of color, especially black communities, more than others — as the aid to health care workers and businesses went predominantly to affluent white communities. This violence against black lives isn’t an epidemic as much as it is a 400-year-old history. We are fighting a virus that demands we change our behavior to survive, even as our country’s racist history, also, demands that of us.

This is the 50th anniversary of the first Pride march; the month started with marches already in progress, a good way to honor the Stonewall uprising that likewise protested excessive police violence. June 14 saw crowds marching in several cities to insist that black trans lives matter. All of the activists I know are genuinely surprised at the diverse, organized crowds at the protests and the seismic changes that have happened without the elections we were told to wait for.

I want to believe real change is coming. I am also someone who is nervous when he feels that way, having seen, so often, the defeats handed out when victory is declared too soon — traditionally the result when solidarity with black leaders is abandoned. The AIDS crisis is not over, the coronavirus pandemic is not over, and the violence against black communities is not over. This country is still that country. All the same, I am prepared to be surprised — for this country, at last, to never be that country again."
1 Dead and 1 Injured After Gunfire in Seattle’s ‘Autonomous Zone’,"One person died and another was critically injured by gunfire early Saturday morning inside a portion of a Seattle neighborhood that has been occupied by protesters for more than a week, officials said.

The shootings unfolded at a protester-run region known as the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone or the Capitol Hill Organized Protest area. It has been celebrated as a “no cop” zone, and the Seattle Police Department wrote in a statement that detectives were investigating the shooting “despite the challenges presented by the circumstances.”

This month, the city made the unusual decision to abandon a police station in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, board up the windows and let protesters have free rein outside, in the wake of demonstrations nationwide over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.

Protesters laid claim to several city blocks and put up a banner on the front entrance of the emptied police station reading, “This space is now property of the Seattle people.” The zone, with the atmosphere of a street festival or commune frequented by families during daytime hours, drew the ire of President Trump, who called on Twitter for officials to crack down on protesters and declared that “Domestic Terrorists have taken over Seattle.”

On Saturday, records show officers responding to a report of shots fired at Cal Anderson Park around 2:20 a.m.

John Moore, 23, a volunteer medic working inside the zone, said he believed there were two separate shootings. He was less than 150 feet away from the first one, treating someone who had been punched in the face during some confrontations in the crowd, when he heard about six to eight shots.

After assessing the scene and rushing to grab a bag of medical supplies, he said, people in the crowd brought the first victim to his team. Mr. Moore said the person had a gunshot wound in a shoulder and another in a thigh, and the medics began treatment. The victim had a pulse for about two minutes before it stopped. The team performed CPR.

As they treated the man, Mr. Moore said the group was on the phone trying to get the Seattle Fire Department to come help. The city had worked in recent days to alter barricades in the zone to give emergency personnel access into the area. But Mr. Moore said the Fire Department would not come.

Instead, Mr. Moore said, the group planned to meet the Fire Department at a previously designated intersection outside of the zone. But after getting the person in a truck while continuing CPR, the group arrived at the intersection to find nobody waiting there. So they continued to a hospital.

Mr. Moore expressed frustration about the lack of aid, although he said it might not have made a difference given the victim’s dire condition. He said other medics treating the second victim nearby also reported difficulties with getting support.

The Fire Department said it had set up outside the zone but would not enter the area unless the police had secured the area. A spokeswoman said she did not immediately know the details about discussions with the medics inside the zone.

The Seattle police said in a statement that the suspect or suspects fled, and that the motive was unknown.

“Officers attempted to locate a shooting victim but were met by a violent crowd that prevented officers’ safe access to the victims,” the police statement said.

Videos taken at the scene and posted on social media by Converge Media showed the volunteer medics racing through crowds of onlookers in the pre-dawn darkness. Tensions were high as some protesters appeared to object to the arrival of the police.

As armed officers in riot gear entered the zone, people screamed, “The victim left the premises!” At one point, protesters briefly surrounded a police car and then yelled, as the vehicle sped away, “Whose streets? Our streets!”

The police said they were eventually informed that two men had been transported to a hospital by the protest camp’s medics. A 19-year-old man died and another man was being treated for life-threatening injuries, the authorities said.

Gov. Jay Inslee said on Saturday that he was saddened to hear of a shooting and was still gathering information about what had occurred. But he said it was clear that the government needed to be able to provide protection for all citizens, including in that zone, and that “other options” might need to be explored.

“We have to have a way to provide police services and fire services in that area,” Mr. Inslee said.

Mr. Moore said he did not think policing would have helped prevent the shooting. And he said the act of violence was not reason to shut down the protest zone, which has been advocating reforms to policing and other parts of government.

“We are out here because officials are not doing their jobs,” Mr. Moore said. “They are not listening to us. They refuse to make any meaningful concessions.”"
"In Kentucky, Racial Justice Movement Transforms Quest to Oust McConnell","LEXINGTON, Ky. — Senate Democrats thought they had it all planned out.

Maybe they couldn’t defeat Senator Mitch McConnell, their legislative bête noire, in Kentucky this November. But by nominating Amy McGrath, a former Marine fighter pilot who earned a national following in a close 2018 House race, they figured they could keep the race relatively competitive, raise a Brinks truck full of cash against the majority leader and perhaps draw some extra money for their efforts to reclaim the Senate.

Then came the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor, who was shot eight times after officers entered her apartment in Louisville with a battering ram. And suddenly everything changed.

Ms. McGrath now finds herself in a rapidly tightening race against Charles Booker, a 35-year-old African-American state representative who was tear-gassed by the police at a recent protest.

With just over a week until the Democratic primary, the fury in Kentucky over Ms. Taylor’s death, uncertainty about voting in a pandemic and a host of late endorsements from progressive leaders have provided fresh momentum to Mr. Booker’s candidacy — upending a nominating contest few in the national party were even following last month.

Polls indicate Mr. Booker is closing the gap against Ms. McGrath, even though she had raised nearly $41 million to his $788,000 as of the start of the month. In just a few weeks since then, though, he has raised almost $3 million.

“I’m traveling Kentucky talking about structural racism and I’m seeing folks, even 99 percent white, putting their fists in the air because they know that we can’t let this moment pass,” Mr. Booker, clad in a “No More No Knocks” T-shirt, recounted to a multiracial audience on Saturday in Lexington.

Then Mr. Booker asked the college-town crowd — a mix of local black residents, former University of Kentucky athletes and white students and faculty in Wildcat tailgating chairs — to raise a fist. And they did, some seemingly for the first time.

Ms. McGrath’s mammoth fund-raising advantage and the decision by a number of Kentucky Democrats to cast early ballots may still propel her to victory.

But that Mr. Booker could make the primary competitive at all illustrates the increasingly progressive tilt of the Democratic Party, as outrage over racial injustice amplifies the calls for transformative change. An unabashed progressive, Mr. Booker is running on “Medicare for all” and the Green New Deal.

transcript

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”



Today’s Senate primary in Kentucky has been transformed by the outcry over police brutality. Jonathan Martin, on what the election can tell us about the future of Democratic politics.

It’s Tuesday, June 23.

Jonathan, tell me about today’s Senate race in Kentucky.

Well, this is the Democratic primary to take on Senator Mitch McConnell, who, of course, is the majority leader of the Senate. And, for a long time, it seemed like his Democratic opponent was going to be Amy McGrath —

I’m Amy McGrath, and I love our country. I spent 20 years as a U.S. Marine, flew 89 combat missions bombing Al Queda and the Taliban.

— who came to some fame nationally in her 2018 House race on the basis of her resume.

I was the first woman marine to fly in an F18 in combat, and I got to land on aircraft carriers.

She was a Marine pilot, and entered the House race talking a lot about her military experience —

This is my new mission — to take on a Congress full of career politicians who treat the people of Kentucky like they’re disposable.

— and almost immediately gained this national profile.

Some are telling me a Democrat can’t win that battle in Kentucky, that we can’t take back our country for my kids and yours. We’ll see about that.

But she was not a terribly good candidate, it turns out.

This is a disappointment to Democrats. It comes from state to Kentucky. Amy McGrath, the former Marine combat pilot, defeated by the four-term incumbent, Andy Barr.

She was running in a pretty difficult seat for a Democrat.

But this is a district that Trump won by 15 points. Her opponent, Andy Barr, looks like will get that fourth term.

And she lost what was otherwise a great year for Democrats. But Chuck Schumer, who runs the Senate Democratic caucus, and effectively runs recruitment of Senate Democratic candidates, figured that she had one very important asset that could help him in 2020. She raised a lot of money and built a large list of national donors in 2018.

Hm. And so, as this Senate — not House race — gets underway this year, I’m guessing Chuck Schumer decides to look to Amy McGrath once again.

Exactly. Because the idea was not necessarily to beat Mitch McConnell, but to at least keep the race competitive, keep McConnell pinned down in Kentucky, keep him focused on raising money for his own re-election, and perhaps siphon some national G.O.P. money that would otherwise go to different states, and have it go to Kentucky. So that was Schumer’s thinking.

Look, Amy McGrath is our candidate. She’s a strong candidate.

And he looked at McGrath and saw her money potential, saw the sort of breadth of her national donor list, and said —

She’s giving McConnell a run for his money. The Republican super PAC put $10 million dollars into Kentucky. She’s doing very well.

— this is who I want to be our nominee against McConnell. And I’m going to make sure that she does not have any kind of a consequential primary to speak of.

So he wants to clear a path for her to become the nominee.

Right. Schumer wants to clear the field. He wants McGrath to be their candidate. He doesn’t want to deal with drama in the primary. He just wants to have her raising money, putting up enormous numbers to spook McConnell, and divert McConnell’s attention back to his own home state and his own re-election. So it does seem like, for some time, that McGrath is not going to have a terribly competitive primary. And so while McGrath seems to be full steam ahead towards the general election, with not much of a primary to speak of, she is banking money at an extraordinary rate. She has raised over $40 million, which is more money than a lot of Senate candidates raise in an entire campaign, let alone a primary.

Yeah. That’s a lot of money. So as far as everybody is concerned, especially back in Washington, Amy McGrath is on a glide path to the nomination.

Exactly right. And then something happens.



We turn now to a deadly police-involved shooting in Louisville. The victim was an E.M.T. Her family claims she was executed by police, as officers served a search warrant in the middle of the night.

On March 13, shortly after midnight, Louisville police officers used a battering ram to enter the apartment of Breonna Taylor, who was a 26-year-old African-American emergency room tech, and shot her eight times while she was in bed in her own apartment.

So they just went into her apartment looking for a suspect, whom we now understand was already in police custody. This is not unique to Louisville.

We need answers. We need answers, because this should have never happened.

And this killing of Miss Taylor by Louisville police sparked an outcry in the state —

We have right to live while black!

— that is then amplified, sadly, by the killing in late May of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

(CHANTING) George Floyd!

Say his name!

George Floyd!

Say her name!

Breonna Taylor!

Say her name!

Breonna Taylor!

Say her name!

Breonna Taylor!

And how does that begin to impact this Senate race?

The activism in the aftermath of the killing of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd is extremely intense in Kentucky, and especially in Louisville. The demonstrations are nightly. There are clashes with police. And there is a candidate who is running from Louisville. He’s an African-American, and his candidacy is now starting to get more attention.

[APPLAUSE] I stand before you as your brother, as your cousin, as your neighbor, as your fellow good troublemaker.

My name is Charles Booker. [CHEERING]

35-year-old state representative named Charles Booker.

I’m state representative for the 43rd District, which we are standing in. And if you are not from the 43rd District, I represent you anyway. [CHEERING]

So he represents what he likes to say is the poorest zip code in all of Kentucky.

No one pays attention to my neighborhood. In the West end of Louisville, with roughly 75,000 people, we have just a couple of grocery stores, a handful of dollar stores, because they prey on us.

He is from the West End of Louisville, black neighborhood.

And if you need to use public transportation to get to the hospital, it can take you a couple of hours. Jobs have left.

And he is someone who is running as a progressive, and had been running as a progressive —

Our platform is about ending structural inequity, and ending generational poverty.

— talking about issues like the Green New Deal, like single-payer health care, but hadn’t gotten a lot of attention in large part because he hadn’t raised much money. And McGrath had raised so much cash.

Right.

But after the killing of Taylor and then Floyd —

We are crying out for Brianna Taylor, and we’re crying out for ourselves.

— once these demonstrations get going, there is now suddenly more attention to Booker. Because he is a state lawmaker who is in these protests.

When Breonna died, when she was killed —

Murdered!

— a part of us was killed, as well.

Yes!

He is getting tear gassed in the streets of Louisville. And he is seeing this up front. He is experiencing this himself, day in, day out in his hometown. He is effectively a Black Lives Matter candidate.

But if you look like me, if you look like him, if you look like him, if you look like her, you may be seen as a deadly weapon before being seen as a human being.

Yes!

It ain’t right, and it’s hurting all of us.

And so what happens to Booker’s candidacy as these protests intensify in Louisville, and all over the country?

Well, the two largest papers in the state, The Courier-Journal in Louisville and Lexington Herald-Leader, taking note of this fraught moment of racial politics, endorse Booker and state that he’s the best candidate for these times. So that helps to give him traction. And then, in addition to getting that key local support, he’s getting the attention from national progressive leaders. Bernie Sanders offers his endorsement. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez gets behind his candidacy. And that’s putting him on the sort of national progressive radar screen, if you will.

So Jonathan, as Booker is, from everything you’re describing, catching fire, what is the party’s anointed candidate, Amy McGrath, doing in response?

Well, she is talking about these demonstrations and about the killing of George Floyd a little bit more, in recognition that she can’t take the primary for granted. But Amy McGrath is not a natural politician. This was part of her struggle in 2018. And it does not go perfectly when she tries to engage these issues. In fact, in a debate she’s asked the question about —

Have you been on the ground in Louisville with the protesters the last three days or in Lexington or elsewhere, Miss McGrath?

— have you been to any of the protests. And she answers pretty awkwardly.

I have not.

And, why?

Well, I’ve been with my family and I’ve had some family things going on this past weekend. But I’ve been following the news and making sure that — you know, I think — we’re in the middle of a pandemic.



So suddenly, Amy McGrath’s politics of moderation and her distance from these protests are seeming quite out of sync with the moment.

Right. And, more to the point, Booker is very much tapping into the moment. This is suddenly a competitive primary. Amy McGrath has had to spend an enormous amount of money on ads in the last couple of weeks to sustain her advantage — money that I think she and national Democrats thought that they would use against McConnell. And Booker has made this more of a competitive race going into the primary Tuesday.

And so what is Booker’s surge here? What does that mean for Democratic Party leaders back in Washington, who bet so heavily on Amy McGrath?

So Booker illustrates that the intensity, the activism that we’re seeing on the streets of America in the last few weeks, is now at the door front of the Democratic Party. And Democrats are eager to harness this energy and activism, especially when it comes to organizing against President Trump and Republicans this fall. But when it comes to their own races, their own primaries, their own party, it’s more complicated. So this does also represent a challenge to Democratic leaders.



We’ll be right back.

Jonathan, how is it a challenge for Democratic Party leaders to have a candidate like Booker doing really well? Because on the surface it seems like a hotly contested Democratic primary that raises lots of attention, raises lots of money, that that’s a good thing for the party.

Well, it creates a challenge, because Chuck Schumer has gotten used to being able to dictate primaries in the Senate races basically every two years. But it’s not just about Schumer. This is about the Democratic Party’s leadership being able to keep its grip on who the nominees are going to be, where the money is going to go. And this is a real challenge to that power, that grip on the party.

And why does that grip matter if it may be out of sync with what Democratic primary voters want?

Well, because leaders like Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi believe that to keep or gain majorities they have to appeal to a broad cross-section of voters, and that that means nominating some candidates who are more moderate depending upon the state or the district that they’re running in.

And Booker does not fit that mold.

Exactly. Leaders like Schumer are skeptical that a candidate of Booker’s liberal politics could win the race in a place like Kentucky, where Trump won by 30 points four years ago. But I think to get closer to the bone here, if Schumer is not able to control the outcomes of these Democratic primaries, and he’s got people in his caucus, potentially, who are not loyal to him, who won despite his intervention, then that’s going to create vote counting headaches for him. And looking at the map right now, his majority is probably going to be, if there is one, a seat or two. It’s not going to be that extensive. So every vote counts. So he’s thinking about, who am I going to have in my caucus? Who’s going to be reliable? Who’s going to be less so? And so that’s where this matters.

This reminds me a little bit of what House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dealt with, with the election of the squad, among whom is Alexander Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, progressive Democrats who tugged the entire body at times to the left in ways that House leadership wasn’t perhaps ready for.

But it’s even more delicate in the case of Schumer because of math, because the Senate is going to be so closely divided next year. And if Democrats have a majority, it’ll be a narrow one. Think about it. Pelosi in the House — she won 40 seats in 2018. They had a pretty robust majority. So you could lose a handful of progressives, like the squad, and basically cater to your more moderate Democrats, because those are the ones that had numbers. This is just a more sort of delicate situation because the Senate is on a knife’s edge.

Jonathan, we’re talking about this race in Kentucky as if it is very high stakes for Chuck Schumer. But how much does this race, in particular, really matter?

So this less about eventually beating McConnell, which is going to be a tall order in Kentucky, then it is about what’s happening in the Democratic Party. And it’s not just in Kentucky. Also on Tuesday, there is a competitive primary featuring Eliot Engel, who’s the long-serving chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who’s facing a primary from an African-American, Jamaal Bowman. In Virginia, a fairly conservative district, there is also an African-American running in that primary. So what I’m really interested in watching these primaries unfold is can progressives gather strength, organize and sort of overcome the establishment candidates in some of these races? But also, is 2020 going to be for black candidates what 2018 was for a lot of women, which is sort of capturing the energy of the moment? And I think that’s going to be one of the most fascinating things to watch on Tuesday, is can black candidates like Jamaal Bowman in New York, like Booker in Kentucky — can they build these multi-racial coalitions, capitalizing on this extraordinary moment of race in America?

Jonathan, it would seem counterproductive, not to mention perhaps hypocritical, for the Democratic leadership to stand in the way of such a change within their party, that you described. I mean, the party said it welcomed all these progressive women in 2018. And wouldn’t it want to welcome and celebrate African-American progressive candidates in this coming election cycle?

Well, here’s the catch. A lot of the women in 2018 — the Democrats embraced — were more moderate. You know, the squad got the attention. But a lot of the women who ran and won in 2018, who were not as well known, are much more centrist in their political orientation. I think the difference here is twofold. First of all, I think there is concern that some of their politics are too progressive for their states or districts. And I think in the case of Engel, of Congressman Engel, it’s just a matter of protecting incumbents. That’s a longstanding rule in both parties, that they support incumbents. So Nancy Pelosi, Andrew Cuomo feel obliged to support a longtime ally, somebody who’s up for re-election.

Right. They don’t want to lose loyal votes, longtime allies. That all makes sense for the leadership, in theory. But isn’t the greater risk for Democratic leaders, on a really practical level, that they are missing this moment? They are not getting behind candidates. And they risk losing touch with this very powerful constituency that seems to be ascendant within the party.

Right! The left would say, this is what the moment is, and this is about the country now needs and demands. Given the virus, given issues of racial injustice, given the economic collapse, the moment cries out for real substantive sweeping policy changes in America, and that if you don’t abide that, if you don’t recognize that, then you’re out of touch as a Democratic leader. And I think this conversation — this tension between the left and the center in the Democratic party, I think, is really going to come to the fore.

And in that version of this, Jonathan, what becomes of some of these Democratic leaders who we started this conversation focusing on, like a Senator Schumer?

Well, they have to adapt to the moment. And if they don’t, then they’re going to pay a political price in their own party. And they risk losing control of their own party’s nominating process, because they would further feed this energy on the left, and risk having their own colleagues lose primaries. And, yes, even perhaps in Schumer’s case, they would risk their own seats.



You know, I’ve spent a lot of time talking to candidates. And they often try to hedge or they often try to trim their answers to reflect the states that they’re running in. But that was not the case when I talked to Booker.

Amy McGrath, your opponent, your primary opponent — do you think that she would lose to McConnell in the fall?

Of course.

He was very straightforward about the fact that he believes the moderate approach, trying to not be seen as too ideological, was a loser in Kentucky.

It’s the same playbook that loses every time. And it’s this political B.S. that says, the only way you can beat them is just raise a whole lot of money.

Right.

Flood the airwaves. Don’t talk about real issues. Don’t talk about poverty. Just play the political game and you’ll peel off some conservative voters. That never works.

He said we’ve tried that before. He said, we’ve seen that playbook used time and time again. And people are not going to fall for that bullshit again.

These aren’t issues that I’m choosing out of political expediency. This is out of survival. We need the Green New Deal, because we need a cleaner environment. We need sustainable jobs. We need more investment in infrastructure.

They want somebody who’s going to be true to themselves, who is not going to try to sort of hammer or hedge. And he didn’t mince any words.

But, Charles, what are you going to save the day after the primary when Schumer calls you on the phone says, if you want the money, you want our help, you got to ease off on some of that stuff?

Well, we’re beating the status quo in the primary, and so I think that conversation will go a little bit different.

Jonathan, thank you very much.

Thank you.



Polls in Kentucky opened at 6:00 a.m. today. Thousands of Democrats cast mail-in ballots, some of them weeks ago, before the race had tightened. Long lines are expected for those who plan to vote in person. A single polling place has been designated for Louisville, Booker’s hometown, and a city of 600,000. We’ll be right back.

 Here’s what else you need to know today. On Monday, President Trump signed a sweeping executive order that bars many foreign workers from receiving visas through the end of the year, preventing those workers from filling more than half a million jobs. The White House said that the restriction on several different kinds of work visas would protect U.S. jobs in the midst of an economic crisis. But the move is opposed by many businesses, from tech firms to manufacturers, who say that it will hamper their ability to fill key jobs that Americans can’t or won’t do. And —

Good morning, good afternoon and good evening. It seems that almost every day we reach a new and grim record. Yesterday, more than 183,000 new cases of Covid were reported to W.H.O., easily the most in a single day so far.

— in a press conference on Monday, the World Health Organization warned that global infections from the coronavirus keep reaching record highs, fueled by the rise of cases in India, Mexico, South Africa and Brazil, which has become the second country after the U.S. to report more than 50,000 deaths from the virus.

Some countries that have successfully suppressed transmission are now seeing an upswing in cases as they reopen their societies and economies.

The United States now accounts for 20 percent of total new infections worldwide. Two states have reported more than 100,000 cases each over the past 14 days, Florida and Texas, where the governor, Greg Abbott, called the data, quote, “unacceptable” —

I know that some people feel that wearing a mask is inconvenient or that it is like an infringement of freedom. But I also know that wearing a mask will help us to keep Texas open.

— and urged residents to maintain precautions to avoid another lockdown.

Because not taking action to slow the spread will cause Covid to spread even worse, risking people’s lives and ultimately leading to the closure of more businesses.



That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.

More significantly, this contest foreshadows the difficulty that establishment-aligned Democratic leaders like Senator Chuck Schumer may have with their restive base should the party’s most powerful force for unity, its loathing of President Trump, be eliminated by the time the 2022 midterms roll around.

The ascendant left could prove especially formidable if, as in Kentucky and New York this year, they keep rallying behind nonwhite insurgents who are able to build coalitions between liberal whites and racial minority groups.

“You’re going to see young people, people of color, working-class people participating in the Democratic Party in a way that we have not seen for a very, very long time,” predicted Senator Bernie Sanders, who, along with Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, has gotten behind Mr. Booker. “That is not going to be able to be controlled by the Democratic establishment.”

Kentucky, then, amounts to something of a dry run for the left, a test of whether grass-roots energy can overcome fearsome fund-raising, and whether Mr. Schumer’s ability to keep coronating candidates from Washington can be sustained should Democrats take full control of the government, and liberals grow frustrated with the glacial pace of the upper chamber.

Harry Reid, the former Senate Democratic leader who is not taking sides in the Kentucky race but who called Mr. Booker “a terrific candidate,” said Mr. Schumer would face considerable pressure to eliminate the 60-vote threshold in order to pass the sort of sweeping legislation many in the party are demanding.

“It’s not a question of if the filibuster is going to go away, it’s only a question of when it’s going to go away,” Mr. Reid said.

No matter who wins the Kentucky primary on Tuesday, he or she will confront an uphill race against Mr. McConnell in a state that Mr. Trump carried by about 30 points four years ago. Even with his poll numbers plummeting, Republican and Democratic surveys still show the president enjoying a comfortable, double-digit advantage in Kentucky.

The more consequential question, though, is determining how to run in a red state against a figure like Mr. McConnell, who, in addition to being the second-most detested man in blue America, is the architect of the modern Kentucky Republican Party and, at 78, is determined to serve at least one more term.

In an interview outside a forum on race relations she attended in Lexington, Ms. McGrath, 45, said that “most Kentuckians believe in common sense approaches to solutions” and are “tired of the partisanship.”

She has stressed her military service, as she did in her well-funded, if unsuccessful, House race, while also highlighting her role as a mother. But Ms. McGrath has irritated some Kentucky Democrats with her attempts to veer to the political center. She indicated she would have supported the confirmation of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court before quickly reversing course, and has even argued that Mr. McConnell is an impediment to Mr. Trump’s agenda.

“It’s the same playbook that loses every time,” Mr. Booker said in an interview, referring to Ms. McGrath’s approach. “This political B.S. that says the only way you can beat him is just raise a whole lot of money, flood the airwaves, don’t talk about real issues, don’t talk about poverty.”

He flatly declared that she would lose to Mr. McConnell, while Ms. McGrath declined to predict that Mr. Booker would face the same fate. She did, though, note the breadth of her coalition, arguing that to win the general election, “We need support from all around Kentucky.”

Mr. Booker, who likes to point out that he is from Kentucky’s poorest ZIP code, said such rhetoric is a thinly veiled suggestion that his support is limited to his native Louisville and other black enclaves in the overwhelmingly white state.

The idea, he said, is that “if you look like I do, and you come from where I come from, that you don’t connect to Appalachia.”

The former state House speaker Greg Stumbo, an institution in eastern Kentucky politics, said the swelling crowds for Mr. Booker in rural communities like his own indicated otherwise.

“My buddy Charles Booker is in the right place at the right time,” said Mr. Stumbo, who is white. He expressed awe at the crowds showing up for Mr. Booker and for Black Lives Matter rallies “in a place like Prestonburg, Ky., which as far as I know there are no African-Americans living within the city limits.”

Interviews with voters at protests in Louisville and Lexington last weekend revealed considerable support for Mr. Booker across racial lines — and in part because of his own participation in the demonstrations.

Cameron French, 21, and his two siblings said there was similar enthusiasm in the mountains of their native Wolfe County.

“We’re all three from eastern Kentucky and we’re seeing Black Lives Matter protests across eastern Kentucky,” Mr. French said at the Lexington rally shortly before posing for a picture with Mr. Booker.

Mr. Booker is trying to capitalize on the protests with a new ad featuring Ms. McGrath’s stilted answer from a recent debate, in which she conceded she had not been to any demonstrations.

Ms. McGrath has responded with a new spot of her own that invokes the killing of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody — but also somewhat awkwardly tries to tie him and his dying pleas for his mother to her own message.

“Everyone is someone’s child and as a mom I will never forget that,” she says in the ad.No congressional candidate has ever raised so much money only to lose a primary but some forces in Kentucky are rallying against her, while others are staying notably quiet.

The state’s two largest newspapers have endorsed Mr. Booker, as has Mr. McConnell’s 2014 opponent, Alison Lundergan Grimes. Prominent Democratic officials like Gov. Andy Beshear and Representative John Yarmuth are staying out of the race.

Despite her missteps, and the notable lack of public support from state leaders, Ms. McGrath enjoys not only a financial advantage, but also an assumption among many voters that she’d run more closely against Mr. McConnell.

“Her military background is very appealing to folks, this is a more conservative state,” said Mairead Moloney, a University of Kentucky professor who attended the race forum.

Jimmi Nicholson, who also works at the university, said that she was supporting Mr. Booker but that he probably could not win the general election because “it’s Kentucky and he’s an African-American male.”

Last year, though, Kentuckians overwhelmingly elected a black man to statewide office, installing a conservative McConnell protégé, Daniel Cameron, as attorney general. Kentucky Democrats have never nominated an African-American candidate to statewide office.

Joni Jenkins, the state House minority leader and a Booker supporter, said that Mr. Booker’s authenticity was more important than his race.

“Some of us elected officials run not to lose and play the safe game, but there ain’t nothing safe about Charles Booker’s campaign,” Ms. Jenkins said.

That, of course, is what worries leaders like Mr. Schumer, who Mr. Booker said has not reached out to him.

The Senate Democratic leader repeatedly pressed some prominent Kentucky Democrats to help him squelch a primary challenge to Ms. McGrath, admitting privately that she would not be a top-tier candidate, but that they could use her to raise money against Mr. McConnell and keep him pinned down in his own race, according to officials familiar with the conversations.Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Mr. Schumer expressed confidence in Ms. McGrath, but also nodded at how pleased he was that the race was diverting G.O.P. resources. “The Republican super PAC put $10 million into Kentucky,” he said, alluding to the Senate Leadership Fund.

Ms. McGrath may still hang on. It was not difficult to find voters who had already cast their absentee ballots for her. And to protect people from the coronavirus, Mr. Booker’s hometown, Louisville, will only have one polling place on Tuesday.

Yet requests for absentee ballots have soared, particularly in the two largest cities, where store after store displays signs honoring Ms. Taylor.

Mr. Booker mentioned her name at the Lexington rally, vowing to make her and other black people killed by the police proud.

“The whole country is looking to see how we lead in this moment, and we’re showing them just what Kentucky does,” he said."
Minnesota Lawmakers Vowed Police Reform. They Couldn’t Agree on Any.,"MINNEAPOLIS — Political leaders in Minnesota promised sweeping changes after George Floyd’s killing turned their state into a focal point for nationwide fury and grief over police killings and racism.

But those efforts collapsed early on Saturday as leaders in the Minnesota Legislature — the only one in the country where Democrats control one chamber and Republicans the other — failed to compromise on a package of law-enforcement measures before a special session ended.

Ultimately, legislators could not reach a deal that reconciled the Democrats’ calls for far-reaching changes to police oversight with Republican leaders who supported a shorter list of “common-sense police reforms” that included banning chokeholds in most situations and requiring officers to stop their colleagues from using unreasonable force.

Democrats said the plan passed by the Republican-led Senate consisted of tepid half-steps that were already in place in most law-enforcement agencies and did not rise to the moment’s calls for dramatic action. Republicans balked at the proposals passed by the Democrat-controlled House to restore voting rights to tens of thousands of felons and put the state’s attorney general, Keith Ellison, a Democrat, in charge of prosecuting police killings.

Democrats had argued they should stay in session as long as they needed to reach a compromise. Republicans set a deadline of Friday night before returning to their districts, saying they would be willing to return for a one-day session if they were near an agreement.

As the clock ticked toward midnight — and then far past it — leaders of both parties blamed each other in competing news conferences. Paul Gazelka, the Republican leader of the Senate, described the state of negotiations as essentially hopeless.

“If they’re not interested in this,” Mr. Gazelka said, referring to the Democrats’ rejection of his latest proposal, “I don’t think personally that they’ll ever be interested in something that we can agree to.”

Moments later, Jeff Hayden, a Democratic state senator whose district includes the corner where Mr. Floyd was killed, said the Republican plan was unacceptable. “If they decide to leave here without getting anything done, it’s on their hands,” he said.

Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, said on Saturday afternoon that the Legislature’s failure to pass a bill was an “embarrassment” for the state. He blamed Republicans for creating what he said was an arbitrary deadline and said he was shocked that lawmakers had adjourned without an agreement.

“I’m really, really worried the message this sends to all those tens of thousands of protesters who were on the streets, all those families and all those people across Minnesota and across the country that expected this one was going to be different,” Mr. Walz said.

Some lawmakers said they hoped the governor would call them back again next week or later in the summer to take up the issues, but activists worried that the window to change the laws was closing as the 2020 election approaches.

The breakdown finally came just after 6 a.m. on Saturday, when the Senate’s Republican majority voted to adjourn and the Democrat-led House followed. That came after hours of huddled strategy sessions and standoffish meetings in the Capitol as small groups of protesters gathered outside.

While many hearings and negotiations have unfolded virtually because of the coronavirus, State Representative Carlos Mariani, a Democrat, said he sat down with Republicans on Friday afternoon to discuss a compromise.

Mr. Mariani said he told them that his fellow Democrats would not vote for any package that did not address structural changes to policing. The Republicans across the table said they had not yet had time to read every piece of the policing bill that the Democrat-controlled House passed early on Friday morning, he said.

“Take an hour, take a week, take a month” to read it, Mr. Mariani said. “We’re waiting, and the pressure’s building.”

Republican leaders later said they had agreed to alter arbitration proceedings when officers are accused of misconduct, but Democrats said it was not enough.

All week, state legislators held emotional hearings on proposals to increase oversight of how the police use force and are disciplined; change the process for firing officers; and explore alternatives to policing, such as sending social workers to respond when people in mental distress need help.

Families of black men and women killed in confrontations with the police argued that the huge protests and unrest that rippled across Minnesota reflected the cumulative anger of communities that were fed up with police brutality and systemic racism. They cited the killing of Mr. Floyd and the recent deaths of Breonna Taylor, who was killed by the police in her apartment in Louisville, Ky., and Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was chased down by three white residents of a Georgia neighborhood and fatally shot.

“Our families are hurting, our communities are hurting,” Valerie Castile, the mother of Philando Castile, the victim of a 2016 police shooting in suburban St. Paul, said in an emotional day of testimony. “What you saw during these protests are emotions that have been building up over decades.”

The Legislature’s failure to pass a bill was a disheartening turn for activists who have pushed for far-reaching changes to policing, including cutting police budgets or dismantling police departments altogether to reduce the presence of armed officers in minority neighborhoods.

“Every time someone gets killed, there are promises, investigations, and nothing comes of it,” said Dave Bicking of Communities United Against Police Brutality, a Minnesota-based group that made a series of recommendations to the Legislature. “If this doesn’t bring something and make us get heard, I shudder to think what it might take.”

Governor Walz, who had called on lawmakers to stay at the Statehouse in St. Paul as long as it took to pass a police overhaul package, said on Saturday that he was struggling to think of what to say at a planned meeting with Ms. Castile later in the day.

“She felt that God had given Philando to make a difference in the world, and she said, ‘No one listened, so that’s why you got George,’ and she said, ‘Don’t blow it,’” Mr. Walz said.

The debate in the Legislature was unusually combative, and tensions worsened this week as members of the People of Color and Indigenous Caucus said some white lawmakers had not consulted with them or valued their input or that of the districts they represent. At one point, the Republican chair of the Senate’s public safety committee, Warren Limmer, who is white, said he did not know that the People of Color and Indigenous Caucus existed in the Senate.

State Representative Mohamud Noor, a Democrat, said the comments and actions from lawmakers this past week showed that some appeared to be learning, for the first time, about racial injustice in Minnesota.

“That speaks volumes — that we don’t see people, people from different walks of lives, within the state,” Mr. Noor said on Thursday. “The racial injustice. The discrimination. The lack of understanding from our perspective, our lived experiences. It’s shameful.”

Protest leaders said it was bitterly ironic that the Legislature’s failures came on Juneteenth. Nekima Levy Armstrong, a lawyer and former president of the Minneapolis N.A.A.C.P. who has led many of the recent demonstrations, said she was disappointed but unsurprised by the impasse.

“Too many members of our Legislature are not taking this seriously,” she said as she hurried off to help distribute groceries and diapers in a largely black Minnesota neighborhood whose only grocery store had been closed since the unrest after Mr. Floyd’s death on May 25. “It sends a signal that black lives don’t matter. We feel like we’re under siege in our own state.”

At midnight, Democrats in the House shared a counteroffer, dropping several significant demands, including their proposals that the attorney general investigate police killings and that people convicted of felonies be allowed to vote. As they shared the plan with reporters, the lights in the Capitol building switched off. The lawmakers stayed, and the lights flickered back on, but as the sun rose in the morning and a deal still could not be reached, they went home.

Elijah McClain Died After He Was Detained. Now He’s Being Remembered.,"ATLANTA — The story of Elijah McClain’s death, which came after he was confronted and detained by police officers last year in the Denver suburb of Aurora, Colo., did not go unnoticed by residents and the local news media in the weeks that followed.

Articles were published, and a few modest rallies were held. But it was nothing like the avalanche of fresh attention his killing received after the death last month of George Floyd sent thousands of protesters onto the nation’s streets, including in Colorado.

Now the story of Mr. McClain — a 23-year-old black man who had committed no crime but was reported as “sketchy” by a 911 caller — has come to occupy a central place in the state’s emotional and fast-moving debate over police reform.

Mr. McClain’s mother was a high-profile presence in the Statehouse this spring as legislators debated a sweeping police reform law. The city of Aurora recently banned a type of controversial hold that had been used to detain Mr. McClain, and jettisoned an outside investigator — who had been hired to look into the killing — because he was a former police officer.

“If George Floyd didn’t die, I don’t think people would have paid attention to Elijah McClain,” said Tay Anderson, an activist and director of the Denver Public Schools board, in an interview. “I think people would have continued to ignore it.”

Instead, celebrities like the singers Michelle Branch and Kacey Musgraves have been sharing Mr. McClain’s story on social media. And nearly 1.4 million people have signed a petition asking for the officers to be taken off duty and for a more rigorous investigation into Mr. McClain’s death.

Mr. McClain’s killing is among many deadly episodes involving the police that are now receiving renewed scrutiny in the wake of outrage over the death of Mr. Floyd, who gasped for breath beneath the weight of a police officer’s knee, a fatal encounter that was captured on video.

The death of Mr. Floyd, who was black, also unleashed a tsunami of demonstrations against police brutality and entrenched systemic racism, in turn elevating several cases that had been little known to the world but had burned like scars in the minds of neighbors.

Across the nation, from San Francisco to Houston to Duluth, Minn., the names of other men and women killed in confrontations with the police are now on the lips of protesters or back on the pages of the local newspapers.

Some police killings that have followed Mr. Floyd’s have become flash points, such as the fatal shooting this month of Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta. Within days, the police chief resigned, the police officer who pulled the trigger was fired and then charged with murder, a second officer was put on administrative duty and charged with assault, and the mayor announced a series of measures aimed at overhauling the Police Department.

transcript

On Friday night, June 12, an employee at a Wendy’s restaurant in South Atlanta calls 911. A 27-year-old man named Rayshard Brooks had fallen asleep in his car in the drive-through lane. Soon, two police officers respond. They and Mr. Brooks speak calmly and cordially for 41 minutes. “That was it.” But then in just 45 seconds, one of the officers fatally shoots Mr. Brooks as he is running away. [gunshots] How could a routine police response go so suddenly and horribly wrong? The Times examined witness videos, security footage, police body-cam and dash-cam videos. We synchronized and slowed down those videos so we can see and hear what unfolded. We reviewed police records, and procedures, and statements made by the officers involved. And we identified the critical moments and missteps that led to a young man losing his life. It’s 10:41 p.m., eight minutes after the 911 call when Officer Devin Brosnan arrives at Wendy’s. He raps on Brooks’s car window and wakes him up. Brooks appears groggy and disoriented. [beeping] Brosnan, who joined the Atlanta Police Department last year, talks to Brooks and then requests an officer who can perform sobriety tests. At 10:55 p.m., Officer Garrett Rolfe arrives. [beeping] Rolfe joined the Atlanta Police Force in 2013, and is an experienced D.U.I. investigator. Rolfe has once been reprimanded for firing his service weapon, police records show. He takes charge of the investigation. Rolfe begins to question Brooks, who is confused about where he is. He seems to think he’s six miles down the road near a Home Lodge Hotel. There’s another Wendy’s right beside it. At 11:02 p.m., Rolfe asks Brooks to get out of the car. Moments later, Brooks will also consent to a series of sobriety tests. Brooks is clearly inebriated. But he’s compliant and friendly throughout this time. The officers are courteous. And Rolfe gives him clear and precise instructions. When Rolfe now asks Brooks if he’ll take a breathalyzer test, Brooks hesitates at first. Brooks offers to go to his sister’s house. Why did Brooks want to resolve his situation without being arrested? According to court records, he was on probation for domestic violence and theft offenses. He was probably aware that a new arrest or conviction would almost certainly send him back to prison. The breathalyzer returns a blood alcohol reading of .108 percent, above the legal limit of .08 percent. Rolfe has little option now but to charge Brooks with D.U.I. Some policing experts told us he could have written a citation and drove Brooks home. Others said police are expected to show zero tolerance with drunken driving. For 41 minutes, Brooks and the officers have spoken calmly and respectfully. They even shared a few laughs. Now, Rolfe moves to arrest Brooks. And in 45 seconds, he will fatally shoot him. [gunshots] [yelling] Let’s watch this back, and break down what happens. Rolfe has signaled or sought Brooks’s consent for every action to this point. But he moves to handcuff Brooks swiftly and without clearly telling him he’s under arrest. This breaches D.U.I. arrest procedures. Brooks resists, and the three tumble to the ground. Brosnan draws his Taser … … and pushes it into Brooks’s leg. Brooks grabs the Taser. Both officers’ body cameras fall to the ground. Brooks stands up and strikes Rolfe with an open hand. As Rolfe draws his Taser, Brooks fires a dart, hitting Brosnan’s arm. Rolfe fires the Taser twice … [yelling] … and hits Brooks’s body. We hear Rolfe using his Taser as he chases Brooks. This is a breach of police procedures. Rolfe passes the Taser to his left hand and reaches for his gun. Brooks looks behind and fires the Taser he’s holding. We confirmed these Taser models with the Atlanta Police. Once they’re fired twice, they must be reloaded. So at this point, Brooks is unarmed. Rolfe drops his Taser, draws his handgun and fires three times at Brooks, who is 18 feet away and is trying to escape in a busy Wendy’s parking lot. [gunshots] Two bullets hit Brooks in the back, one piercing his heart. A third bullet hits this Chevrolet Trailblazer, which had three passengers in it. This photo from the Fulton County District Attorney shows the bullet hole. No one in the car was injured. Rolfe shouts at Brooks … ... and appears to kick him on the ground. This image, also provided by the Fulton County D.A., shows that moment more clearly. Officer Brosnan approaches and briefly stands on Brooks’s shoulder. [yelling] Meanwhile, witnesses denounce the shooting. The officers stand over Brooks for about a minute before Rolfe runs back to his vehicle to get his medical kit. Brosnan continues to stand by. It’s over two minutes before Brooks receives medical assistance. “Every fucking time!” Rolfe administers CPR until emergency services take over. At 11:39 p.m., 15 minutes after he’s shot, an ambulance takes Rayshard Brooks to a hospital where he is later announced dead. Was Rolfe justified in shooting a man holding a Taser, and who was trying to escape? Police procedures on the use of deadly force state that an officer must reasonably believe the suspect possesses a deadly weapon, and that the suspect poses an immediate threat of serious bodily injury to the officer or others. In a statement made through his lawyer, Officer Rolfe said he did use reasonable force because he “heard a sound like a gunshot” and fearing for his safety and the safety of others, he “fired” his weapon. The description of a gunshot doesn’t square with what Rolfe told investigating police at the scene. And minutes before this, Rolfe appears to have been aware that Brooks fired the Taser twice. This and other evidence will be scrutinized in what has now become a homicide investigation. Rolfe has been charged on 11 counts, including felony murder, and both officers with aggravated assault.

In the New Orleans area, demonstrators have protested the fatal shooting of Modesto Reyes, a black man who was shot by sheriff’s deputies in suburban Jefferson Parish two days after Mr. Floyd’s death on Memorial Day. (The Sheriff’s Department said Mr. Reyes pointed a gun at deputies as they were chasing him.)

The reverberations of the moment have also reached back decades: In Minnesota last week, Mr. Floyd was invoked as part of a successful effort to secure the posthumous pardon of Max Mason, a black man wrongly convicted of raping a white woman 100 years ago.

“As I told the pardon board, the case of Max Mason is like the case of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Philando Castile,” said Jerry Blackwell, the Minneapolis lawyer who drafted the pardon application, mentioning the names of other black men whose violent deaths have become high-profile human rights causes. “What they all have in common is a stereotypical and racist view of black men in this country.”

It remains to be seen whether the renewed focus on many of these less prominent cases will have a tangible effect on their outcomes.

Sam Walker, an expert on police accountability at the University of Nebraska Omaha, said it was not clear whether old, closed cases would be reopened for investigation. But at the very least, he said, the new attention underscores the fact that problem cases are not anomalies.

“What I think is important is the extent to which the public discussion in the African-American community on these old cases really represents the collective memory that exists, that doesn’t exist for whites,” Mr. Walker said. “It dredges up all these old issues and passions: This happens all the time; justice is never done.”

District attorneys tend to deny that public opinion factors into their decisions to prosecute or not. But four days after Mr. Floyd’s death, the district attorney in Austin, Texas, took the unusual step of announcing that she would send a local case, the death of Michael Ramos, who was fatally shot by the police in April, to a grand jury.

Grand jury proceedings are secret, and normally prosecutors do not signal when one is being convened. But the district attorney, Margaret Moore, said times were different now.

“I thought it was important for the people of Travis County to know we are indeed prosecuting the case. I was hopeful that it would help this community,” she said. “Because of the heightened attention to these cases, the anger, the fear, the frustration — all of which I came into office three years ago intending to address in this community — I’m modifying now to answer the new demands of the moment.”

Outrage over Mr. Floyd’s death ushered renewed attention to several recent deaths. Breonna Taylor was fatally shot in March when the Louisville police broke down the door of her apartment in a raid that found no drugs. Her case garnered scant attention until after Mr. Floyd’s death, when the number of Google searches for her name immediately began to rise.

In Oklahoma City, the police released video of the death of Derrick Scott, who died a year ago in police custody after a confrontation with officers. In Kansas City, Mo., this week, prosecutors announced the indictment of a white police detective for the 2019 fatal shooting of a black man, Cameron Lamb, whose name was among many that local demonstrators have been raising in street protests.

And in Houston, activists have been ratcheting up pressure on the Police Department to release body camera footage of the killing in April of a mentally ill 27-year-old Latino man, Nicolas Chavez. A harrowing video shot by a resident appears to show officers shooting Mr. Chavez multiple times while he is on his knees.

In some cases, news outlets have played a key role in bringing new details to light. In Austin, protesters have memorialized Javier Ambler, another Texas man, who died in March 2019. Williamson County sheriff’s deputies tried to stop Mr. Ambler for failing to dim his headlights, according to news reports, and then pursued him when he did not stop. They held him down and Tased him while he pleaded that he had congestive heart failure and could not breathe.

A film crew for “Live PD” was with the pursuing officer and filmed the encounter, but later claimed to have destroyed the footage because, the host said, the show had a policy of not showing fatalities. The show has since been canceled.

The Austin American-Statesman and KVUE-TV, the local ABC affiliate, had been requesting more information on the case for months, but had only recently obtained police documents and video, The American-Statesman reported. The newspaper published an article on June 8 that said Mr. Ambler had cried, “Save me,” before deputies shocked him a final time.

“His death never made headlines,” the article stated.

Street protests, too, have given the family members of those killed by the police a receptive audience for their stories.

On June 6 in Washington, Kenithia Alston, the mother of a young man killed by police officers two years earlier, took a microphone and told a street packed with hundreds of Black Lives Matter protesters about her fruitless struggle to convince the capital’s Metropolitan Police Department to release the full, unedited body camera video of the incident.

“So what I’m asking all of you here today is to tweet, Facebook, Instagram — tell this mayor to release the body cam!” Ms. Alston said.

Four days later, the Georgetown Law Civil Rights Clinic filed a $100 million wrongful death lawsuit against the city government on Ms. Alston’s behalf. The suit claims that her 22-year-old son Marqueese Alston was confronted and chased by the police “without good cause or valid basis” and shot 12 to 18 times.

The Police Department did not respond to questions about the case, but in news reports at the time, they said that Mr. Alston had fired at officers with a handgun. Ms. Alston said she was able to view a short, edited version of the body camera footage, but that it did not convince her that her son was armed. She also said it shows that her son was “running away from police when he was shot.”

Ms. Alston felt like some headway was being made. “It seems like people are starting to pay attention now,” she said.

But Ms. Alston’s lawyer, Zina Makar, a supervising attorney at Georgetown Law, said the case’s higher profile may only do so much for a matter that will ultimately be settled in court. “The interest is helpful,” Ms. Makar said, “but it doesn’t necessarily change the hurdles we have to jump.”

Despite the growing clamor to look at new cases, some families know that theirs will not be among them — and they instead take solace in the ways in which the protests are pushing for broad criminal justice reforms.

In 1986, Jimmie Lee Bruce Jr., 20, was home from college for winter break and went to the movies in Walkill, N.Y., with friends. He was killed by a white police officer, moonlighting as a security guard, who put him in a chokehold in the parking lot. His mother, Maude Bruce, 75, was the president of the Ellenville, N.Y., chapter of the N.A.A.C.P.

She said that at the time there were rallies for her son outside the police station, and in Albany, where the governor acceded to demands to appoint a special prosecutor. Two grand juries declined to indict the officer, she said.

Ms. Bruce said there was no chance the case would be reopened. But recently, she listened as the assemblyman who represented her at the time testified in Albany in favor of a bill to ban chokeholds, which passed and was signed into law.

“He said Jimmie Lee Bruce Jr. didn’t die in vain,” she said, “because 36 years later, we are here.”"
Trump’s Juneteenth Tweet: A Warning to Protesters at His Tulsa Rally,"WASHINGTON — President Trump struck a combative stance on Friday for the holiday dedicated to the end of slavery, issuing a thinly veiled threat against protesters who have been marching against systemic racism and may show up at his campaign rally on Saturday in Tulsa, Okla., and warning that disruptions would not be tolerated.

The president’s outburst, in which he referred to the protesters as “looters,” came just hours after he used two fake videos to accuse news organizations of inventing racism where it does not exist. The videos appeared to be designed to push the idea that Trump supporters are falsely accused of being racists. Both Twitter and Facebook removed one of the videos on Friday.

The twin provocations, coming as many Americans grapple with the country’s racist history, made for a discordant message from the president on the Juneteenth holiday, and served as reminders that even days of commemoration and national reflection are not free of Mr. Trump’s divisive approach to the presidency.

“Any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma please understand, you will not be treated like you have been in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Friday morning. “It will be a much different scene!”

In his tweet, Mr. Trump drew no distinction between peaceful protesters, whose right to assemble and speak out is protected by the First Amendment, and violent looters, some of whom were responsible for vandalism and fires that broke out during largely peaceful demonstrations across the country expressing outrage over the killing of George Floyd.

The lead-up to the rally in Tulsa has been tumultuous, as safety concerns over the coronavirus intersect with the celebration of Juneteenth and the president’s divisive rhetoric as he plans a raucous return to the campaign trail.

On Friday afternoon, the Oklahoma Supreme Court rejected a legal bid to stop the rally filed by local residents and businesses, who had demanded that the event be postponed unless the arena hosting it agreed to enforce social distancing guidelines.

At the same time, city officials rescinded a three-night curfew, after Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he had spoken with the mayor, “who informed me there will be no curfew tonight or tomorrow for our many supporters” — a chaotic about-face from the previous plans.

The Juneteenth holiday celebrates the end of slavery in the United States and has taken on added significance for many Americans this year. The White House on Friday issued a Juneteenth message that itself clashed with Mr. Trump’s online remarks, committing to “live true to our highest ideals and to build always toward a freer, stronger country that values the dignity and boundless potential of all Americans.”

Mr. Trump’s threats, both on Twitter and off, often amount to little more than bluster, and it was not clear if the president was simply using Twitter to excite his base ahead of a politically charged Saturday night or whether he planned to mobilize the National Guard or other levers of government to take to the streets of Tulsa. 

Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Friday that the president did not mean to threaten peaceful protesters. “What he was meaning are violent protesters,” Ms. McEnany said.

The Tulsa Police Department said it would not comment on the president’s tweet. “We are allowing citizens to exercise their First Amendment rights in a peaceful manner,” a spokeswoman said.

“I could get the flu someday — you never know. So I’m not going to worry about it. I don’t feel like I’m going to get the coronavirus. I use safety measures when I need to, but when I don’t, I’m just going to be my regular self.” “I really thought this was an important rally for me to go to. It’s the ninth one I’ve been to, but after having been away from rallies for so long, I think that there’s going to be some very important themes the president’s going to introduce here. And I wanted to be here to support his message.” “Well, we have face masks with this — and how do you feel about it, Mark?” “I think it’s all a hoax, to tell you the truth.”

The rally will be Mr. Trump’s return to the campaign trail after the coronavirus deprived him for three months of the arenas packed with die-hard fans that serve as the cornerstone of his political brand.

He is resuming campaign mode as the country reckons with its history of racial violence. That legacy is painfully significant in Tulsa, the site of a 1921 race massacre, when up to 300 people were killed and hundreds of homes and businesses were destroyed in a historic black neighborhood.

In the neighborhood, known as “Black Wall Street” before the massacre, Tulsans gathered on Friday to celebrate Juneteenth. The words “Black Lives Matter” had been painted across Greenwood Avenue in bright yellow block letters.

Mr. Trump originally planned to hold his rally in Tulsa on Friday. But after days of criticism over the idea of holding a political rally on Juneteenth during a national uproar over racial injustice, the president agreed to postpone the event by one day.

This week he tried to turn the criticism on its head, saying he was responsible for elevating the holiday’s status.

“I made Juneteenth very famous,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, discussing the controversy surrounding his rally. “It’s actually an important event, an important time. But nobody had ever heard of it.”

The Republican National Committee has tried to spin Mr. Trump’s visit to Tulsa as an opportunity to shed light on African-American history, rather than a repudiation of it.

“When the Trump campaign announced the rally in Tulsa it gave the world an opportunity to learn more about and from Black Wall Street, not just the massacre but why it was so significant,” Paris Dennard, an R.N.C. adviser for black media affairs, wrote in The Tulsa World on Thursday.

But whatever concessions to the holiday Mr. Trump was initially willing to make, as Juneteenth approached he reverted to the kind of racist provocations that have defined his presidency.

On Thursday night, he first tweeted out a video that purported to show a clip from CNN in which a black toddler is shown running from a white toddler as ominous music plays in the background.

The label at the bottom reads: “BREAKING NEWS: TERRIFIED TODLER RUNS FROM RACIST BABY.” The video goes on to show that the two children were in fact playing happily together. It ends by saying: “AMERICA IS NOT THE PROBLEM. FAKE NEWS IS.”

Twitter flagged the president’s tweet with a “manipulated media” warning that says, “Video being shared of CNN report on toddlers is doctored, journalists confirm.” Then on Friday Twitter removed the video, as did Facebook.

The second video that Mr. Trump tweeted Thursday, a slickly produced, campaign-style video, accuses liberals and the news media of assuming that Trump supporters are racists. It shows a woman posting a video of a white man wearing a Make America Great Again hat yelling “go, go” at the black driver of a car.

“My racist neighbor just chased my BLACK Uber driver out of our neighborhood,” the woman writes on a social media site, with the hashtags: MAGA, Racist and Love Trumps Hate.

In the video, her posting goes viral, with more than 1.6 million views and reactions from people blaming Mr. Trump and calling him “a Nazi.”

The video also appears to use a fake CNN chyron saying “WHITE MAN IN MAGA HAT ATTACKS BLACK UBER DRIVER.”

The staged video then reveals that the white man had been helping the driver out of a patch of ice by pushing the car, and was yelling “go, go” so it wouldn’t get stuck again.

Then on Friday came Mr. Trump’s tweet about cracking down on the protesters.

Mr. Trump is expected to land in Tulsa for his rally as coronavirus cases are rising in the city and the state over all, and as public health officials have issued warnings about the dangers of bringing together a large crowd indoors. On Wednesday, the city announced 96 new cases of the coronavirus, the largest single-day increase in Tulsa since March.

Local health officials have warned that Mr. Trump’s rally has the potential to become a “super spreader” event.

Tulsa’s police chief, Wendell Franklin, said this week that his department was planning for “a mass amount of people that probably Tulsa has never seen before.”

On Thursday, Mayor G.T. Bynum signed an order imposing a three-night 10 p.m. curfew in the area around the BOK Center, where the rally is to be held, stating that the city was expecting crowds “in excess of 100,000 people in the vicinity of the rally.” That order was rescinded after Mr. Trump’s tweet, even as police officials had been making plans to enforce it.

The operators of the arena, which seats 19,000, on Thursday demanded a last-minute written health and safety plan from the Trump campaign, including any plans related to social distancing. Mr. Trump and his aides have made it clear that they want to hold a packed rally with the look and feel of a pre-coronavirus event."
U.S. Watched George Floyd Protests in 15 Cities Using Aerial Surveillance,"GRAND FORKS, N.D. — The Department of Homeland Security deployed helicopters, airplanes and drones over 15 cities where demonstrators gathered to protest the death of George Floyd, logging at least 270 hours of surveillance, far more than previously revealed, according to Customs and Border Protection data.

The department’s dispatching of unmanned aircraft over protests in Minneapolis last month sparked a congressional inquiry and widespread accusations that the federal agency had infringed on the privacy rights of demonstrators.

But that was just one piece of a nationwide operation that deployed resources usually used to patrol the U.S. border for smugglers and illegal crossings. Aircraft filmed demonstrations in Dayton, Ohio; New York City; Buffalo and Philadelphia, among other cities, sending video footage in real time to control centers managed by Air and Marine Operations, a branch of Customs and Border Protection.

The footage was then fed into a digital network managed by the Homeland Security Department, called “Big Pipe,” which can be accessed by other federal agencies and local police departments for use in future investigations, according to senior officials with Air and Marine Operations.

The revelations come amid a fierce national debate over police tactics and the role that federal law enforcement and military forces should play in controlling or monitoring demonstrations. The clearing of demonstrators from Lafayette Park in Washington for a presidential photo op is still under scrutiny. The Air Force inspector general is investigating whether the military improperly used a reconnaissance plane to monitor peaceful protesters in Washington and Minneapolis this month.

And the National Guard in the District of Columbia has already reached a preliminary conclusion that a lack of clarity in commands led to one of its medical evacuation helicopters swooping low on protesters in the nation’s capital. Renewed calls to demilitarize police work have not only come from criminal justice advocates but also former Republican Homeland Security officials such as Michael Chertoff and Tom Ridge, the first two leaders of the Homeland Security Department, which was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Officials at the Customs and Border Protection base here rejected any notion that their fleet of aircraft had been misused, either to violate privacy rights or intimidate protesters.

“The worst part for me is when we’re made out to be storm troopers,” said David Fulcher, the deputy director for air operations at the National Air Security Operations Center in Grand Forks. “We believe in peaceful protests.”

The aircraft, they said, were used to provide an eagle-eyed view of violent acts and arson. The Predator drone deployed to Minneapolis, like eight other unmanned aircraft owned by Air and Marine Operations, was neither armed nor equipped with facial recognition technology and flew at a height that made it impossible to identify individuals or license plates, according to senior officials here.

“The legend of the Predator — the all-seeing, all-knowing, hover-outside-your-window Predator — it’s just not accurate,” Mr. Fulcher said. “The technology is not there.”

But House Democrats and privacy advocates still worry over the potential dissemination of the footage and the chilling effect that militarized aircrafts could have on peaceful protests.

Earlier this month, Democrats with the House Oversight Committee, including Representatives Carolyn B. Maloney and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, and Stephen F. Lynch and Ayanna Pressley, both of Massachusetts, protested to Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of homeland security.

“This administration has undermined the First Amendment freedoms of Americans of all races who are rightfully protesting George Floyd’s killing,” the Democrats said in a letter to Mr. Wolf. “The deployment of drones and officers to surveil protests is a gross abuse of authority and is particularly chilling when used against Americans who are protesting law enforcement brutality.”

But Democrats apparently were unaware of the breadth of the agency’s actions. Most of surveillance was done with planes and helicopters. Air and Marine Operations did dispatch drones to two demonstrations — in Minneapolis and in Del Rio, Texas.

The agency’s AS350 helicopters conducted more than 168 hours of surveillance of protests in 13 different cities, the longest stretch being 58 hours over Detroit, according to data provided by Air and Marine Operations. The agency also deployed a Blackhawk helicopter for nearly 13 hours, assisting other federal agencies with surveillance in Washington, D.C. Kris Grogan, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection, said the agency’s Blackhawk was not one of the helicopters that flew low over the demonstrators and caused panic.

A Cessna single-engine plane conducted nearly 58 hours of surveillance, more than 38 of them over Buffalo. Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said in a tweet this month that the officers manning that plane helped track down suspects who used an S.U.V. to hit local police on the ground.

Most of the requests did not come from local police departments. In Minneapolis, the call came from an agent in Homeland Security Investigations, the branch of Immigration and Customs Enforcement that conducts longer-term investigations into terrorists, weapons trafficking and drug smuggling.

The agent, who was on the ground in Minneapolis and works with Air and Marine Operations regularly, requested the help on May 28 after reports of arson and violence in the area. Air and Marine Operations, which also dispatches drones from Sierra Vista, Ariz., and Corpus Christi, Texas, was not able to send the aircraft until the next day. After about two hours of surveilling, the agent and other law enforcement agencies said it was no longer needed.

“It’s discretionary, but there’s a huge degree of accountability as far as who can say yes or no to deploying these assets,” said Jonathan Miller, the executive director of the National Air Security Operations at Customs and Border Protection.

Air and Marine Operations officials said agency protocol prevents infringement on the right to protest. The drones, which can stay in the air from 12 to roughly 24 hours depending on how much radar equipment is attached, are directed to fly no lower than 19,000 feet. From that height, the “electrical optical-infrared ball” on the drones wouldn’t allow the operators to see faces, eyes or hair color, according to the Department of Homeland Security’s privacy impact assessment for the aircrafts.

But operators can track movements of protesters or looters, direct law enforcement on the ground and see if someone is wearing a backpack or rifle. And stored footage could be accessed later to corroborate investigative findings, such as a witness account that a fire was set at a given time by a small group or the escape route of a suspect.

A live feed of the footage is sent to a mobile operations center, where a group of agents monitor television screens while moving the drone with joysticks. Other federal agents that request a view from the sky can also see the footage on their phones, Mr. Fulcher said.

Mr. Fulcher said the surveillance footage, stored on the aircraft and in control rooms, is overwritten after an average of 30 days by new feeds. But video feeds and radar images sent to “Big Pipe” can also be analyzed by Homeland Security Department intelligence officers. That data may be stored for “up to five years,” according to Homeland Security’s Privacy Impact Assessment. If federal agencies or police departments can prove they need the footage for a criminal investigation, the video can be provided, according to the document and Mr. Fulcher.

The Department of Homeland Security did not say whether any law enforcement agencies had requested footage of the demonstrations.

Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the aircraft could discourage people from protesting. The concern is not only what the border agency is doing with the aircraft and footage but how future operations could adapt to quickly advancing technology.

“You see an aircraft, you have no idea currently what technologies that aircraft is carrying,” Mr. Stanley said. “There is something militaristic and dominating about a militarized police aircraft hovering over you when you’re out there protesting police abuse.”

Air and Marine Operations recorded more than 92,800 hours of flight time in the fiscal year that ended in September, most of that spent patrolling the border. But the helicopters, planes and drones spent more than 8,000 hours helping law enforcement agencies with search and rescue missions and other criminal investigations."
Top State Department Aide Resigns Over Trump’s Response to Racial Unrest,"WASHINGTON — One of the highest-ranking African Americans in the administration delivered a stinging rebuke to President Trump’s handling of racial unrest, announcing her resignation and accusing the president of confronting the country’s recent upheaval in ways that “cut sharply against my core values and convictions.”

Mary Elizabeth Taylor, the assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs and a loyal aide since the start of Mr. Trump’s administration, said she will depart in the wake of Mr. Trump’s dismissive response to demands for racial justice following the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minnesota police officer.

“Moments of upheaval can change you, shift the trajectory of your life, and mold your character,” she wrote in a letter dated Thursday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, criticizing the president’s “comments and actions” about the protests around the country. “I must follow the dictates of my conscience and resign.”

Mr. Trump has been roundly criticized for inflaming the protests that erupted in American cities following Mr. Floyd’s death by writing tweets that endorsed hard-core police tactics and ordering the violent clearing of protesters around the White House before he held a photo op in front of a nearby church.

Top aides to Mr. Trump have repeatedly defended his actions as a necessary response to violence and looting. But Ms. Taylor’s resignation, first reported by The Washington Post, was the clearest evidence yet that widespread anger and disappointment about his response to the recent events has spread even inside the top ranks of the administration.

Her standing in the administration and within the party gave her critique particular force. A longtime Republican with deep ties to Capitol Hill, Ms. Taylor has been one of the few high-profile African-Americans in Mr. Trump’s administration since the beginning, serving first in the White House and later at the State Department, where she formed a close bond with Mr. Pompeo. In her resignation letter, she praised his “remarkable leadership.”

But in openly condemning the president, Ms. Taylor joined just a handful of other former Trump advisers who have publicly questioned his judgment and character after resigning from top positions in the government.

In recent days, Jim Mattis, the former secretary of defense, accused Mr. Trump of being “the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people.” John F. Kelly, the president’s former chief of staff, said voters should seek to know more about the people they elect, saying “What is their character like? What are their ethics?” 

The chorus of criticism comes as Mr. Trump nears the end of a tumultuous term in the Oval Office in which he repeatedly made xenophobic or racially insensitive comments. In a 2017 meeting in the Oval Office he said Haitians “all have AIDS” and that Nigerians would not want to go “back to their huts in Africa.” In 2018, he questioned why America should welcome people from “shithole countries” in Africa.

And after deadly racist violence by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va., Mr. Trump said that there was “blame on both sides,” drawing condemnation from around the globe. He has repeatedly lashed out at Central American migrants, describing members of gangs from those countries as “animals” and suggesting they carry disease and infections into the United States.

Omarosa Manigault Newman, an African-American woman who worked in the White House as a senior adviser to the president, savaged Mr. Trump after being fired in late 2017. In a book titled “Unhinged,” she called him a ”a racist, a bigot and a misogynist” and said he had a complete lack of empathy for others.

The State Department declined to comment on Ms. Taylor’s resignation, saying it does not discuss personnel matters. White House officials did not respond to requests for comment on her resignation letter.

In the letter, Ms. Taylor made clear that her departure was the result of the president’s actions, and she praised Mr. Pompeo “for empowering me to lead this team and strategically advise you over these last two years.” She said he had listened to her with “grace and respect.”

But she also leaves her post amid renewed attention to issues of race within the State Department itself, with lawmakers and diplomats pressing to address the lack of diversity among its ranks.

Ms. Taylor, 30, was the only African-American senior official at the State Department. When Mr. Trump took office there were three career African-American assistant secretaries of state at the agency. Two were asked to resign within the first week, while a third quit months later. Out of 150 ambassadors serving overseas, only three are African-Americans, according to the American Foreign Service Association, which represents career diplomats.

Kiron Skinner, who was the agency’s former director of policy planning, was one of the highest-ranking African-American women in the department when she was forced out of her job last August.

On Wednesday, the House held a hearing on diversity at the State Department, with some lawmakers criticizing the agency for not having enough minorities and women in its work force, especially at its highest levels.

Ms. Taylor was unanimously confirmed by the Senate to her State Department role in October 2018. She is the first black female assistant secretary of legislative affairs, and is the youngest person ever to assume the role.

Before her position at the State Department, she served as the White House’s deputy director of legislative affairs and nominations, where she managed the Senate confirmations of over 400 Trump administration appointees, including those of Justice Neil Gorsuch, Mr. Pompeo and Gina Haspel, the director of the C.I.A.

She also served as an aide to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader.

The State Department’s efforts to increase diversity in its ranks have fallen short compared with the federal government’s average, according to a Government Accountability Office report released in February.

The watchdog agency found that the department’s minority work force increased slightly to 32 percent from 28 percent from 2002 to 2018, but the share of African-Americans working in the department declined to 15 percent from 17 percent. Hispanics in the department work force rose to 7 percent from 5 percent during the same period.

Mr. Pompeo has praised the department’s commitment to diversity in a June 10 email sent to staff members, in which he said he shared Americans’ “outrage at the brutal killing” of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

“I am proud that the composition of our State Department work force also reflects America’s devotion to the principle of equal opportunity,” Mr. Pompeo wrote. “Nearly one-third of our team members are minorities — an all-time high — and 44 percent are women.”

" 5 Years After Church Massacre, Charleston to Remove Symbol of Slavery","Five years after a white gunman shot to death nine African-American churchgoers at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, city officials in Charleston, S.C., announced plans on Wednesday to remove a towering statue of one of the 19th century’s most influential defenders of slavery, and to move forward with an agenda on “equity, inclusion and racial conciliation” in the city where the first shots of the Civil War were fired.

Mayor John J. Tecklenburg stood at the foot of the 110-foot monument to John C. Calhoun, the former vice president and senator, and said that he would put a resolution before the City Council to move the statue from its commanding location in Marion Square in the heart of Charleston.

Mr. Tecklenburg, who said Mr. Calhoun “can rightly be called both South Carolina’s most prominent national statesman, and also its most consequential defender of slavery and white supremacy,” said his purpose was “not to erase our long and often tragic history, but to begin a new and more equitable chapter of that history.”

William Dudley Gregorie, a city councilman and member of the Emanuel church, went further, saying that a newly formed commission on equity and racial conciliation would examine all statues in Charleston, and recommend the erection of new statues of the enslaved people who built the city.

“The removal of this statue is just the beginning,” Mr. Gregorie said. “We are not on our knees praying today — we are taking action today.”

He said the commission would work to overhaul all the systems in the city that are embedded with racism.

“It’s a great day for me personally, as a member of a family that understands brutality, that understands the shooting death of loved ones in this city,” Mr. Gregorie said. His sister’s mother-in-law died in the church massacre.

“Racism is violent and evil, and is the foundation of an unjust America,” he said. “This system, it’s not broken — it was founded and designed on violent, vicious evil racism.”

The Calhoun monument has been a gnawingly offensive symbol to black people in Charleston for more than a century. But the remarkable moment on Wednesday reflected two different spasms of grief in America.

The first followed the shooting at the church on June 17, 2015, when a 21-year-old white supremacist opened fire with a semiautomatic handgun while congregants had their eyes closed for prayer during Bible study. The more recent is the unrest, anger and urgency spawned by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the deaths of other black men and women in recent years at the hands of the police.

The attack on the church five years ago set off a reckoning that in many ways prefigured the one happening now, nudging the country to stare down a tragic history on race that continues to manifest itself in countless ways. Charleston five years after the shooting serves as a sort of precedent, illustrating the progress that can come from grappling with thorny questions about race and inequality, and also the obstacles to achieving lasting change.

The efforts spurred by the church shooting were also about changing hearts and minds, a fight in which ground is gained by way of conversations and subtle reflection as well as by legislation and toppled monuments.

“We have seen the country is not as far along as we would have hoped,” said the Rev. Eric S.C. Manning, the pastor of Emanuel. “But we are inspired by the young people, and the amount of fortitude and the amount of energy they are bringing to light with these protests.”

Even so, many in the city point to what they see as markers of achievement: Almost immediately after the church shooting, the Confederate battle flag that had flown over the statehouse grounds in Columbia came down, and monuments and markers celebrating African-American history were put up.

The city initiated an audit of racial bias in the Charleston Police Department, and found a need for sweeping change. It also issued a formal apology for slavery. Yet the measure to issue the apology passed in the City Council by only a 7-5 vote, and critics derided it as an empty gesture.

“It’s an affirmation of the fact that there is in our nation, sadly, still evidence of racism and disrespect,” said Joseph P. Riley Jr, who was mayor of Charleston for 40 years, including at the time of the shooting. “The ultimate act five years ago was kind of a most severe example one could imagine of racial hatred.”

Not everyone sees much progress.

Willi Glee, a member of Emanuel since the early 1990s, said that he hasn’t seen any changes in the past five years that have addressed the issues of white supremacy and racism.

Neither an apology for slavery nor relocating a statue reach the root of racism in Charleston. Mr. Glee participated in civil rights marches and protests in the 1960s; now, he says, ”we’re back to where we were.”

John Darby, co-chair of the Emanuel Nine Memorial Foundation, which was formed to build a memorial to the lives lost in the shooting, says it has received donations and pledges of about $7 million toward its $17.5 million goal. Meanwhile, the church itself is struggling to raise funds for badly needed internal repairs. The choir loft is off limits because of longstanding termite damage to its structural supports.

But Mr. Gregorie, the city councilman, said that in the five years since the shooting, he has seen the consciousness of the people of Charleston grow to recognize the systemic racism that black people have faced for hundreds of years in the city and nationwide.

“What has grown out of the tragedy is a closer-knit city, compelled to combat racism and ensure that nothing like this ever happens in our city again,” Mr. Gregorie said

He said he was particularly hopeful about the commission on equity, inclusion and racial conciliation, which was formed to carry out the recommendations listed in the formal apology two years ago. Among them was a promise from city officials to work with residents to fight systemic racism. Ingrained systemic racism is everywhere, Mr. Gregorie said, in the city’s education system, health care system, and in the policing system.

Later in the afternoon, protesters spray-painted “Black Lives Matter” on the base of the monument and put up posters declaring, “Rip it down.” People also left flowers outside Emanuel.

The Council is expected to vote Tuesday on the resolution, which calls for the statue to be relocated to a museum or educational facility where it can be displayed in a less prominent way with added context.

Prior calls to remove it have been thwarted because its site is privately owned. But Mr. Tecklenburg feels he has legal justification to remove it, and because of the urgency of the moment surrounding race, he has the overwhelming support of the City Council.

Mr. Gregorie sees the removal of the monument as part of a long, slow movement forward.

“A city that’s now 350 years old is about to embark on a totally new path toward dealing with structural racism that I see as vicious, violent and is the foundation of unjust America,” he said.

And for some, the personal pain remains undimmed.

On Wednesday, Melvin Graham Jr. visited the grave of his sister, Cynthia Graham Hurd, who was shot to death at the church five years ago.

He is still reeling from her loss, he said. “It hurts, it still hurts,” he said. “In light of all that’s been going on in the country, it makes it hurt more.”

Families Challenge Suicide in Deaths of Black Men Found Hanging From Trees,"The families of two black men who were found hanged from trees in Southern California are asking the authorities to further investigate their deaths.

The family of Robert L. Fuller, 24, disputed the authorities’ initial pronouncement that he died by suicide. The family of Malcolm Harsch, 38, is worried his death will also be ruled a suicide.

Mr. Harsch was found at 7 a.m. on May 31 near a homeless encampment in Victorville, Calif., where bystanders told the authorities he was living. A woman who identified herself as his girlfriend called 911 to say that others in the encampment had notified her that Mr. Harsch had been found hanging from a tree and cut down, the San Bernardino County Sheriff-Coroner’s Department said in a statement.

There were no indications of foul play but the investigation was continuing, a spokeswoman for the department said Sunday.

Firefighters found bystanders performing CPR on Mr. Harsch when they arrived at the scene, according to Sue Jones, the public information officer for the City of Victorville. Firefighters took over and tried to restore Mr. Harsch’s heartbeat, but they stopped after 20 minutes.

“We grieve for Malcolm’s family and extend our deepest condolences,” Ms. Jones said. “Malcolm Harsch’s life mattered.”

Mr. Harsch’s relatives were told by the coroner’s office that his autopsy was completed, said Harmonie Harsch, Mr. Harsch’s sister, but they were not informed of the cause of death.

“We are really just trying to get more answers as to what happened,” Ms. Harsch, 29, said in an interview on Sunday. “My brother was so loving, not only to his family but even strangers. It is not like him.”

Mr. Harsch moved to California 14 years ago from Ohio, Ms. Harsch said.

“He loved doing tattoos, he was very artistic,” she added.

Ms. Harsch said she was conducting her own investigation into her brother’s death.

“It has been stressful,” she said. “It doesn’t sound right.”

Around 50 miles west of Victorville, in Palmdale, Calif., Mr. Fuller’s family questioned the authorities’ pronouncement that his death was considered a suicide.

At a rally for Mr. Fuller on Saturday, Diamond Alexander, his sister, said through tears that the initial resolution on her brother’s death “did not make sense.”

“Everything that they’ve been telling us has not been right,” she said, according to video of the rally in Palmdale. “We’ve been hearing one thing. Then we hear another. And we just want to know the truth.”

A passer-by discovered Mr. Fuller’s body hanging from a tree in Poncitlán Square, across from Palmdale City Hall, at around 3:39 a.m. on Wednesday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.

Though the investigation was continuing, the authorities noted in their news release that “Mr. Fuller, tragically, committed suicide.” Mr. Fuller’s autopsy has not been completed, the authorities said.

“My brother was not suicidal,” Ms. Alexander said. “He wasn’t.”

The men’s deaths have struck a chord with people in northern Los Angeles County and across the nation as many have protested against racism and police brutality for over two weeks, in response to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

A petition demanding for a full investigation into Mr. Fuller’s death had gotten over 215,000 signatures as of Sunday afternoon.

At a news conference held by officials at Palmdale City Hall on Friday, residents made it clear that they did not trust that the local authorities would properly investigate Mr. Fuller’s death. They demanded an independent review and transparency.

“Why was it right here in public, in front of City Hall, next to a church, in front of a library?” one woman said. “Why was it like that? Who would do that? No black man would hang himself in public like that.”"
Policing Bill Will Test Whether a Rusty Senate Can Still Legislate,"WASHINGTON — If the Senate is to have any success at producing a bipartisan policing bill amid a nationwide outcry to address systemic racism in law enforcement, it must do something that has become exceedingly rare in the chamber: legislate.

With Democrats unwilling to accept a Republican measure that they think falls well short of the full-scale overhaul that is needed, the push to advance new controls on police will likely require the type of free-flowing debate that has been notably absent from the Senate in recent years. Without some give on the part of both political parties, the effort is probably doomed until a reset following the November elections.

Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, has suggested he is open to an old-style policy exchange on the floor, promising “opportunities for amendments from both sides.”

“Let me make this perfectly clear,” he said this week. “Senate Republicans are interested in making a law.”

The more frequent alternative on display in today’s United States Senate, of course, is making a point.

The issue will come to a head in the coming days, when Mr. McConnell must decide how far he will go in entertaining alternatives to the Republican bill — and Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, must in turn decide whether to allow the measure to advance or block it outright.

Until Democrats know for sure what Mr. McConnell’s intent is, they do not seem eager to commit to moving forward when the Republican proposal faces its first test next week. Democrats are in no mood to accept any take it-or-leave-it proposition from majority Republicans. Mr. McConnell has similarly declared a sweeping law enforcement overhaul drafted by House Democrats to be a non-starter.

“Merely writing a bill, any bill, is not good enough at this moment in American history,” Mr. Schumer said Thursday. “It’s too low a bar to simply say we’ll write any old bill.”

The Senate hasn’t been very good at writing any bills at all lately, with most of the power and authorship concentrated in the leadership offices. For the most part, only must-pass spending and Pentagon measures or dire emergency response efforts like the pandemic rescue legislation even make it to the floor.

The bipartisan lands bill easily approved by the Senate this week was a rare exception and, like the others, it had tight restrictions severely limiting any attempts to change it.

Mr. McConnell, and Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader before him, both clamped down on the ability of senators to offer amendments in an effort to spare their colleagues politically tough votes and to maintain tight control of both the floor and the resulting legislation. With deep partisan divisions on virtually every issue, old-school legislating dried up, and the Senate has instead become a judicial confirmation assembly line.

As a result, many members of today’s Senate have little experience in the type of more wide-open debate that used to occur on the big issues of the day, worrying that they could be brought down by a single politically charged voted.

“These members are so risk-averse they think that every vote is the end of their career,” said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat who has been in Congress for 37 years.

As it turns out, not voting on amendments can be politically painful as well. Republicans ran against and defeated Senator Mark Begich of Alaska in 2014 partly on a message that he was ineffective since he hadn’t even succeeded in securing a vote on one of his amendments during his six-year term. When Republicans took control of the Senate in 2015, Mr. McConnell promised to restore more no-holds-barred debates, but he steadily backslid, and full-on floor fights never materialized.

That approach will not work for the current debate on race and policing, one on which the two parties are deeply divided but also unusually motivated to get something done.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, who has spent the last year and a half passing Democratic legislation only to see it languish in Mr. McConnell’s Senate, said that she hoped to revive another lost congressional art for the policing bill: a bicameral negotiation in which the two chambers resolve their differences and produce a compromise.

“We would like to end up in conference, because that’s how Congress works its will,” Ms. Pelosi said on Thursday. “The House acts, the Senate acts, and you go to conference and try to reconcile the legislation.”

At least, that is how it used to work. It seldom does any more.

In the Senate, Democrats find the Republican plan, which relies on incentives to improve training and police conduct, woefully inadequate. They are pressing instead for a measure that would make it easier to prosecute and sue police officers for wrongdoing, ban brutal tactics and impose new anti-bias measures in departments across the country.

But it is not only Democrats. Rank-and-file senators in both parties have grown increasingly frustrated at being shut out of the writing of major legislation. Mr. McConnell this week faced a mini-revolt from within his own party when he used a procedural tactic called “filling the tree” to block amendments to the lands bill by fellow Republicans, some of whom took to the floor to complain about it.

Fellow Republicans say they have their own ideas about how to reshape the policing proposal from Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only African-American Republican in the chamber. Senator Mike Braun, Republican of Indiana, is working with Democrats on a proposal that would alter qualified immunity, which shields police officers from lawsuits, an element of the House Democrats’ bill that is likely to emerge as a central issue in the debate.

“I think it is important to trust the Senate to do the work of the Senate,” said Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah. “Allow the senators to be senators.”

Despite the national outcry for federal intervention in the policing crisis, both sides have strong political incentives not to act and may quickly return to their usual corners. Republicans realize they cannot go as far as Democrats would like or risk losing their crucial support on the right and at the White House. Democrats might benefit if the effort collapsed, allowing them to pound Republicans for failing to adequately respond to the crisis as they try to regain the Senate majority in the fall campaign.

But the videotaped death of George Floyd in police custody and the protests it has inspired around the country have brought about a bipartisan sense of urgency on Capitol Hill to address the issues of race and policing.

While Democrats say they think Republicans are not getting serious enough about what needs to be done, the Republican attitude has notably shifted, with leaders rushing to devise a plan to respond to the growing public clamor for change. It is a contrast to negotiations over the criminal justice overhaul in recent years, when many Republicans were worried about being portrayed as weak on law and order and refused to get behind reductions in prison sentences.

“It was like pulling teeth,” said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas and one of the early architects of the criminal justice legislation. “This really struck a nerve, and I think we want to try to do better.”

Senators in both parties said the legislative drive would go nowhere unless they had the chances to weigh in on possible changes. The only chance for success, they said, lies in the Senate shaking off its rust and trying to produce a genuine consensus plan.

“Let us stand up,” Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and the senior member of the Senate, pleaded on the Senate floor on Wednesday. “Let the U.S. Senate be the conscience of the nation again. I note that we have been in the past. Wouldn’t it be nice to be so in the present?”"
Man Charged With Sending Racist Threats to Philadelphia Police Leader,"A Massachusetts man has been charged with sending emails that contained threats of violence and racial slurs to Danielle Outlaw, the police commissioner in Philadelphia, during the city’s protests over the death of George Floyd, the authorities said on Tuesday.

The man, Peter Fratus, of West Dennis, Mass., used a Gmail account to send two messages to the Police Department email address of Commissioner Outlaw, who is African-American, on June 6, amid some of the largest protests across the nation over police misconduct, a criminal complaint said.

The first message, which was sent at 11:18 p.m. Eastern time, threatened to hang black people and also contained anti-Semitic references to the Holocaust, the complaint said. The second message, sent one minute later, had a racial slur in the subject line and said in the body, “Where does police chief live?,” according to the complaint.

Mr. Fratus, 38, was identified two days later as the person who sent the messages, said the authorities, who subpoenaed his internet provider address from Comcast and Apple. He admitted when he was interviewed by the authorities that he had sent the messages and had “crossed the line,” the complaint said.

William M. McSwain, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, said in a statement on Tuesday that the threats were vile and disturbing.

“We take such threats very seriously,” Mr. McSwain said, “and let this be a warning to anyone who might feel the urge to fire off an online threat directed at a public official: We will trace your digital footprint, track you down and hold you accountable.”

Mr. Fratus was charged with transmitting a threat across state lines, which carries a maximum possible penalty of up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. He appeared in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts on Tuesday and was being held in custody until a detention hearing on Friday.

The federal public defender’s office in Massachusetts, which represented Mr. Fratus, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The case is expected to be transferred to U.S. District Court in Philadelphia.

It was not the first time that Mr. Fratus had made threats toward a public official, according to prosecutors, who wrote in a detention motion filed on Wednesday that Mr. Fratus had a history of threatening and assaultive behavior directed at law enforcement officers, politicians and other people because of their race, gender or religion.

He was convicted of assaulting a police officer in Massachusetts last year and was sentenced to 90 days in jail, wrote prosecutors, who noted that Mr. Fratus is on probation. In 2018, he left a phone message for an African-American congresswoman, who was not named, calling her racial slurs and threatening to lynch her if she did not go back to Africa, the motion said. No charges were filed in that episode. He also has a disorderly conduct conviction stemming from a tirade at a business owned by a Palestinian-American in 2016, according to the motion.

“While the First Amendment gives us the right to express our own opinions, violent physical threats are certainly not protected speech,” Michael J. Driscoll, a special agent in charge of the Philadelphia division of the F.B.I., said in a statement on Tuesday.

In December, Commissioner Outlaw became the first black woman chosen to lead the Philadelphia Police Department, which has more than 6,000 officers. She had previously served as the police chief in Portland, Ore.

A Philadelphia Police Department spokeswoman referred requests for comment to the U.S. attorney’s office."
"Reconsidering the Past, One Statue at a Time","The boiling anger that exploded in the days after George Floyd gasped his final breaths is now fueling a national movement to topple perceived symbols of racism and oppression in the United States, as protests over police brutality against African-Americans expand to include demands for a more honest accounting of American history.

In Portland, Ore., demonstrators protesting police killings turned their ire to Thomas Jefferson, toppling a statue of the founding father who also enslaved more than 600 people.

In Richmond, Va., a statue of the Italian navigator and colonizer Christopher Columbus was spray-painted, set on fire and thrown into a lake.

And in Albuquerque, tensions over a statue of Juan de Oñate, a 16th-century colonial governor exiled from New Mexico over cruel treatment of Native Americans, erupted in street skirmishes and a blast of gunfire before the monument was removed on Tuesday.

Across the country, monuments criticized as symbols of historical oppression have been defaced and brought down at warp speed in recent days. The movement initially set its sights on Confederate symbols and examples of racism against African-Americans, but has since exploded into a broader cultural moment, forcing a reckoning over such issues as European colonization and the oppression of Native Americans.

In New Mexico, it has surfaced generations-old tensions among Indigenous, Hispanic and Anglo residents and brought 400 years of turbulent history bubbling to the surface.

“We’re at this inflection point,” said Keegan King, a member of Pueblo of Ácoma, which endured a massacre of 800 or more people directed by Oñate, the brutal Spanish conquistador and colonial governor. The Black Lives Matter movement, he said, had encouraged people to examine the history around them, and not all of it was merely written in books.

“These pieces of systemic racism took the form of monuments and statues and parks,” Mr. King said.

The debate over how to represent the uncomfortable parts of American history has been going on for decades, but the traction for knocking down monuments seen in recent days raises new questions about whether it will result in a fundamental shift in how history is taught to new generations.

“It is a turning point insofar as there are a lot of people now who are invested in telling the story that historians have been laying down for decades,” said Julian Maxwell Hayter, a historian and associate professor at the University of Richmond.

He said that statues removed from parks and street corners could be teaching points if they are placed in museums, side-by-side with documents and first-person accounts from the era.

“Let’s say you put a Columbus statue in a museum and you show students the way Columbus was lionized in a history textbook and you have them read ‘Devastation of the Indies’ by de Las Casas,” he said. “Then you have to ask, why were people invested in telling this particular version of Christopher Columbus’s history?”

The calls to bring down monuments have spanned far and wide, in large cities like Philadelphia and rural places like Columbus, Miss., touching both relatively obscure historical figures and deeply revered cultural symbols.

In Raleigh, N.C., the statue of a former newspaper publisher who was also a white supremacist was removed on Tuesday. In Sacramento, a tribute to John Sutter, a settler famous for his role in the California gold rush who enslaved and exploited Native Americans, was taken down this week. And in Dallas, construction crews recently removed a statue of a Texas Ranger, long seen as a mythical figure in Texas folklore, amid concerns over historical episodes of police brutality and racism within the law enforcement agency.

The push has largely been welcomed by activists from the Black Lives Matter movement who see Confederate and other monuments as reminders of the oppressive history that created the reality they are battling today. But some of them worried that the focus on historic symbols would do little to keep attention on the more pressing issue of ending the brutal treatment of many African-Americans by the police.

“I don’t know if I would say a distraction, because I think people definitely have the ability to be nuanced,” said Alisha Sonnier, a 24-year-old mental health advocate from St. Louis who is concerned that taking down statues could be an “easy appeasement.”

“The statue being removed is not going to keep anyone from dying,” she said. “It’s not going to save a life.”

Cleon Jones, a 77-year-old activist in Africatown, Ala., formed on Mobile Bay by the last known shipment of slaves to the United States from Africa, said he felt frustrated by the notion that progress toward equality could be stalled by rancor over Confederate monuments.

“We’ve got to move forward, not look back,” he said. “As long as we are dealing with these statues, we’re not moving forward.”

The focus on removing statues has revealed deep civil divisions far outside the Black Lives Matter movement that are hundreds of years in the making. It has spurred a backlash among Italian-Americans who have long regarded Columbus as a point of pride, and also among some Hispanics in New Mexico, who celebrate an era when Anglos did not dominate public life.

“We need to have a broader discussion about our history,” said Christine Flowers, a 58-year-old Italian-American immigration lawyer, who was among a group that gathered to protect a statue of Columbus in Philadelphia.

But she added, “It is indefensible to try to erase that history by pulling down something that is very dear and very symbolic for the culture of Italian-Americans in Philadelphia.”

In Columbus, Miss., a largely African-American town, county officials voted on Monday to keep a towering monument to Confederate soldiers — “our heroes,” it calls them — on the courthouse lawn despite mounting calls for its removal.

“It’s a good time to learn some history,” said Trip Hairston, a white county supervisor who opposed removing the monument. “I don’t agree with all that history, of course, but it is what it is — it’s history.”

It was an argument that left many of those pushing to remove the statue perplexed. “It’s commemorating and celebrating a lost battle — I don’t understand,” said David Horton, 28, a lifelong resident of Columbus who first fought against a Confederate monument as a 7th grader at Robert E. Lee Middle School.

“These are things I have to endure all my life as a young African-American man living in Mississippi,” he said. “It’s always made me feel inferior, it’s always made me feel like I shouldn’t hold my head up.”

Symbols of the Confederacy and its legacy of slavery have long been at the center of the reckoning over historic racism in the country.

At least 114 Confederate symbols were removed in the years after a white supremacist killed nine people at a historic African-American church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015, according to a 2019 report by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

The killing of Mr. Floyd in Minneapolis re-energized that movement, as demonstrators chipped away at a 52-foot Confederate obelisk in Birmingham, Ala., and toppled a statue of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, in Richmond, Va.

The statues debate has once again focused attention on Columbus, the voyager who emerged as a symbol of Italians’ contribution to American history in the late 1800s, a time when discrimination against Italians was rampant. But many in recent days are also talking about how his arrival signaled the beginning of a violent European colonization that resulted in a cross-Atlantic slave trade and the genocide and displacement of many Indigenous peoples.

Columbus statues from Boston to Miami have been brought down or defaced by protesters. A large Columbus statue was defaced with red graffiti in Kenosha, Wis., and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York defended a towering monument to the explorer at Columbus Circle in Manhattan.

In Philadelphia, supporters went to court to block the removal of a Columbus statue after another statue, of Frank L. Rizzo, a former mayor known for discriminatory policies, was removed by the city this month in the middle of the night. “You just can’t let the mob rule,” said George Bochetto, a lawyer who filed the petition.

Tensions over the Oñate monument came to a boil Monday night in Albuquerque, when dozens of protesters engaged in shouting matches, some seeing the brutal Spanish governor as a symbol of repression, while others saw him as a positive symbol of a time before Anglos came to dominate the Southwest. Then a group of white militia members, on a self-appointed mission to protect the statue, showed up with guns.

In the mayhem that ensued, a man pulled out a weapon and shot one of the protesters, critically injuring him.

On Tuesday, the authorities in Bernalillo County filed a charge of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon against the man with the gun, identified as Steven Baca, 31. Mr. Baca ran unsuccessfully for the Albuquerque City Council last year.

In Minneapolis, where the demonstrations over Mr. Floyd’s death ignited new protest movements in dozens of cities, many said they never expected them to grow into an international reckoning over racist symbols. Still, they said, it was only a matter of time before the latest police killing of a black man led to something more lasting than previous protests.

“It’s kind of like a wound that has a scab,” said Teron Carter, 49, standing across the street from Cup Foods, the deli near Mr. Floyd’s fatal encounter with the police. “A wound that has a scab is still a wound, it’s just that the scab is on top. And if you scrape that scab a certain way, it reopens the wound.”

He attributed the scope of the burgeoning movement to built-up grief and to the energy of young people who simply are not willing to put up with walking by Confederate and other statues each day.

“It’s not just an isolated city event,” Mr. Carter said. “Now everybody saw the opportunity and said, ‘If we don’t get in there and talk like Minneapolis is talking, then we aren’t going to be heard.’”

Trump Falsely Claims Obama ‘Never Even Tried’ to Address Police Misconduct,"As President Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday encouraging changes to policing, he falsely accused his predecessor, President Barack Obama, of choosing not to tackle the issue. Here’s a fact-check.

What Was Said

“President Obama and Vice President Biden never even tried to fix this during their eight-year period. The reason they didn’t try is because they had no idea how to do it. And it is a complex situation.”

False. The Obama administration tried to address police misconduct in numerous ways, and some of those efforts have been reversed or limited by the Trump administration.

“The assertion that the Trump administration has done more than the Obama administration is ridiculous,” said Barry Friedman, a law professor and director of the Policing Project at New York University School of Law. “The Obama administration has taken a number of critical steps in police reform.”

After a white police officer fatally shot Michael Brown, a black teenager, in 2014 in Ferguson, Mo., Mr. Obama convened a policing task force that produced what Mr. Friedman called “one of the most far-reaching examinations since the 1960s” and a long list of recommendations.

The Trump campaign called the task force “a clear failure” and noted that very few police departments had signed on to join its reform initiative.

Most of the changes that Mr. Trump’s executive order outlines — except the provision that offers more resources for social workers and other mental health professionals — are “not that dramatically different” from the Obama task force’s recommendations, said Alex S. Vitale, who wrote the book “The End of Policing” and who has argued that the recommendations of the previous administration did not sufficiently address the root causes of police misconduct.

“The language that Trump used during his announcement sounded exactly like the language in the Obama report,” Mr. Vitale said.

In 2015, Mr. Obama issued an executive order that placed limits on the Pentagon’s so-called 1033 program, which has sent excess military equipment to the police since the 1990s. It prohibited local police departments from obtaining track armored vehicles, weaponized aircraft grenade launchers and bayonets, at the recommendation of the task force.

Months after Mr. Trump took office, he rescinded those restrictions — keeping a promise he made to the Fraternal Order of Police, the country’s largest police union, during the 2016 election.

“He and his staff are very familiar with our efforts because the F.O.P. lobbied them to limit the work we were doing,” said Roy L. Austin Jr., who was deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division during the Obama administration. “The task force could not have produced a more powerful document in changing policing around the country. Immediately upon President Trump taking office, he made it clear he was eliminating those reforms.”

The Justice Department under Mr. Obama also opened 25 investigations into whether police departments were engaging in a “pattern or practice” of misconduct (an authority granted to the attorney general by the 1994 crime bill). It enforced 14 consent decrees, which are court-approved agreements to overhaul police departments, including in Ferguson.

In comparison, the Justice Department under Mr. Trump has been far less active. So far, it has opened one investigation and signed two agreements, which were based on an investigation opened in 2015, while Mr. Obama was president. (Whether consent decrees are effective is another matter.)

Sixteen law enforcement agencies also participated in the Justice Department’s collaborative reform initiative, a voluntary program started under Mr. Obama. The program assessed a police department’s practices and made recommendations for change.

In 2017, the Justice Department significantly scaled back the program over the objections of some Republican lawmakers.

Echoing the frustrations of many activists, Mr. Vitale said that the previous administration’s overhaul efforts had not produced significant results, but he added: “I don’t think Trump has done more. I just don’t think it’s that different.”

Mr. Obama himself in 2016 acknowledged that “change has been too slow and we have to have a greater sense of urgency about this.”

G.O.P. Architects of the Post-9/11 Security Order Object to Trump’s Heavy Hand,"WASHINGTON — The architects of the post-9/11 domestic security apparatus say the Trump administration’s militarized response to anti-racism demonstrations has been a misuse of law enforcement resources designed to combat threats from overseas.

President George W. Bush’s two permanent secretaries of homeland security, Tom Ridge and Michael Chertoff, joined 21 other homeland and national security officials this week on a letter that labeled the Trump administration’s actions as more like combat against a terrorist threat abroad than law enforcement.

“We reject a militarized response to protests to deny citizens their constitutional rights,” the group wrote. “Moreover, the blanket use of the label ‘terrorists’ to justify the use of paramilitary and military force is both factually wrong and legally unsupportable.”

The letter did not mention President Trump by name, but Mr. Chertoff said in an interview on Tuesday that he signed it after Mr. Trump threatened to unleash the military into cities, deployed Black Hawk and Lakota helicopters on protesters in Washington and dispatched scores of Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to protests in Washington. The job of responding to the demonstrations was better suited for local law enforcement, he said.

“I don’t think you needed to get into low-flying helicopters, tear gas and threats to bring in the U.S. military,” Mr. Chertoff said. He described the move as “an overreaction and pouring gasoline on the fire.”

Mr. Chertoff and Mr. Ridge were joined by other former national security officials from the Obama and Bush administrations, including Michael E. Leiter, a former director of the National Counterterrorism Center under both presidents.

The Trump administration’s deployment of military assets and officials from various federal agencies to American streets in early June, after a weekend of protests that included some instances of looting, has prompted a backlash across the political spectrum. Police departments have responded to protests with riot teams, armored vehicles known as BearCats, tear gas and sound cannons developed by the military. Those actions have only intensified demands from activists to “defund the police.”

Local police departments often get such tactical gear through federal grants from the Justice Department created by the 1994 crime bill and a Defense Department program that allows the police to obtain military equipment no longer used overseas. President Barack Obama had sharply curtailed the Defense Department program after the heavily armed police response in Ferguson, Mo., but Mr. Trump revived it in 2017.

Former law enforcement officials also pointed to the security infrastructure put in place after the Sept. 11 attacks that was supposed to help police departments prevent terrorist attacks. But as public safety agencies shifted their focus from overseas to at home, tactical resources have been repurposed for use within American borders.

The Department of Homeland Security has provided billions of dollars in grants, including more than $1 billion this year, for localities to help defend against a terrorist threat or natural disaster. Police officials have long fought for more of the funds to be geared to law enforcement agencies.

Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant secretary of homeland security in the Obama administration who signed the letter, said the funding was created to prevent the next attack from overseas, not provide local police with riot gear and armored vehicles to respond to demonstrations.

She also pointed to the establishment of law enforcement stations around the United States, known as “fusion centers,” that were created to ensure that federal, state and local agencies could easily share data on potential terrorism threats with each other. Officials in the centers in recent weeks have monitored social media and other sources for indicators of individuals looking to commit an attack under the guise of thousands of peaceful protesters.

“There was a whole infrastructure built in the post-9/11 era that was focused on essentially stopping 19 guys from getting on four airplanes, and that might have been the correct sentiment at the time,” Ms. Kayyem said. “But there are now legacies to that 9/11 genesis that have a strong hold on states and cities, and we just have to break it.”

Mike Sena, the president of the National Fusion Center Association, said those centers are not geared toward collecting the data of demonstrators.

“Anytime there is a mass gathering of people, special events or whatever it may be, a fusion center’s role is to make sure that there are no known threats to the people that are attending,” he said, not to police the crowd.

Last fall, the Department of Homeland Security issued a strategy document highlighting domestic terrorism as a primary threat to the country after being accused for years of underplaying the threat. Leaders of police departments have cited that shift in pushing for the continued federal support.

“There does have to be a line in the sand,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a research organization. “We want to be careful that these assets aren’t used to disrupt peaceful demonstrators, and if they are used that they’re used to prevent violence.”

James Loy, a former acting secretary of homeland security who helped establish the department after Sept. 11, said he understood why police chiefs would want to deploy federal assets to protests if they turned violent. But Mr. Loy, a former Coast Guard commandant under Mr. Bush, questioned how federal law enforcement resources were being used.

The federal system for funding local police “was put into place very assiduously, very carefully in the wake of 9/11, but it was all inside the envelope of counterterrorism,” Mr. Loy said. “It certainly has very little if anything to do with coping with domestic protests guaranteed under the Constitution.”"
Police Decisions Are Scrutinized After Rayshard Brooks’s Fatal Encounter,"[Here’s what you need to know about the death of Rayshard Brooks.]

ATLANTA — From beginning to end, the encounter between Rayshard Brooks and two Atlanta police officers lasted 41 minutes and 17 seconds. For the first 40 minutes, it looked like a textbook example of policing.

The officers treated Mr. Brooks, 27, with respect. They were cordial as they asked about his night and how much he had had to drink. They calmly guided him through a series of sobriety tests.

Then things went dangerously awry, and Mr. Brooks became yet another African-American man to die at the hands of the police. 

The encounter — veering from calm to fatal and captured on video from multiple angles — has become the subject of intense scrutiny. There is vigorous debate over a host of decisions, big and small, that the two officers made last Friday night in a Wendy’s parking lot, where Mr. Brooks had fallen asleep in the driver’s seat in the drive-through lane. 

“It’s at the point where the officer places his hands on him that things go south in a fraction of a second,” said Kalfani Ture, an assistant professor of criminal justice at Quinnipiac University who said he had viewed the video footage more than three dozen times. “So you have to pay attention to the minutiae of details — you have to try to understand decision-making, but you also have to pick out best practices.”

transcript

On Friday night, June 12, an employee at a Wendy’s restaurant in South Atlanta calls 911. A 27-year-old man named Rayshard Brooks had fallen asleep in his car in the drive-through lane. Soon, two police officers respond. They and Mr. Brooks speak calmly and cordially for 41 minutes. “That was it.” But then in just 45 seconds, one of the officers fatally shoots Mr. Brooks as he is running away. [gunshots] How could a routine police response go so suddenly and horribly wrong? The Times examined witness videos, security footage, police body-cam and dash-cam videos. We synchronized and slowed down those videos so we can see and hear what unfolded. We reviewed police records, and procedures, and statements made by the officers involved. And we identified the critical moments and missteps that led to a young man losing his life. It’s 10:41 p.m., eight minutes after the 911 call when Officer Devin Brosnan arrives at Wendy’s. He raps on Brooks’s car window and wakes him up. Brooks appears groggy and disoriented. [beeping] Brosnan, who joined the Atlanta Police Department last year, talks to Brooks and then requests an officer who can perform sobriety tests. At 10:55 p.m., Officer Garrett Rolfe arrives. [beeping] Rolfe joined the Atlanta Police Force in 2013, and is an experienced D.U.I. investigator. Rolfe has once been reprimanded for firing his service weapon, police records show. He takes charge of the investigation. Rolfe begins to question Brooks, who is confused about where he is. He seems to think he’s six miles down the road near a Home Lodge Hotel. There’s another Wendy’s right beside it. At 11:02 p.m., Rolfe asks Brooks to get out of the car. Moments later, Brooks will also consent to a series of sobriety tests. Brooks is clearly inebriated. But he’s compliant and friendly throughout this time. The officers are courteous. And Rolfe gives him clear and precise instructions. When Rolfe now asks Brooks if he’ll take a breathalyzer test, Brooks hesitates at first. Brooks offers to go to his sister’s house. Why did Brooks want to resolve his situation without being arrested? According to court records, he was on probation for domestic violence and theft offenses. He was probably aware that a new arrest or conviction would almost certainly send him back to prison. The breathalyzer returns a blood alcohol reading of .108 percent, above the legal limit of .08 percent. Rolfe has little option now but to charge Brooks with D.U.I. Some policing experts told us he could have written a citation and drove Brooks home. Others said police are expected to show zero tolerance with drunken driving. For 41 minutes, Brooks and the officers have spoken calmly and respectfully. They even shared a few laughs. Now, Rolfe moves to arrest Brooks. And in 45 seconds, he will fatally shoot him. [gunshots] [yelling] Let’s watch this back, and break down what happens. Rolfe has signaled or sought Brooks’s consent for every action to this point. But he moves to handcuff Brooks swiftly and without clearly telling him he’s under arrest. This breaches D.U.I. arrest procedures. Brooks resists, and the three tumble to the ground. Brosnan draws his Taser … … and pushes it into Brooks’s leg. Brooks grabs the Taser. Both officers’ body cameras fall to the ground. Brooks stands up and strikes Rolfe with an open hand. As Rolfe draws his Taser, Brooks fires a dart, hitting Brosnan’s arm. Rolfe fires the Taser twice … [yelling] … and hits Brooks’s body. We hear Rolfe using his Taser as he chases Brooks. This is a breach of police procedures. Rolfe passes the Taser to his left hand and reaches for his gun. Brooks looks behind and fires the Taser he’s holding. We confirmed these Taser models with the Atlanta Police. Once they’re fired twice, they must be reloaded. So at this point, Brooks is unarmed. Rolfe drops his Taser, draws his handgun and fires three times at Brooks, who is 18 feet away and is trying to escape in a busy Wendy’s parking lot. [gunshots] Two bullets hit Brooks in the back, one piercing his heart. A third bullet hits this Chevrolet Trailblazer, which had three passengers in it. This photo from the Fulton County District Attorney shows the bullet hole. No one in the car was injured. Rolfe shouts at Brooks … ... and appears to kick him on the ground. This image, also provided by the Fulton County D.A., shows that moment more clearly. Officer Brosnan approaches and briefly stands on Brooks’s shoulder. [yelling] Meanwhile, witnesses denounce the shooting. The officers stand over Brooks for about a minute before Rolfe runs back to his vehicle to get his medical kit. Brosnan continues to stand by. It’s over two minutes before Brooks receives medical assistance. “Every fucking time!” Rolfe administers CPR until emergency services take over. At 11:39 p.m., 15 minutes after he’s shot, an ambulance takes Rayshard Brooks to a hospital where he is later announced dead. Was Rolfe justified in shooting a man holding a Taser, and who was trying to escape? Police procedures on the use of deadly force state that an officer must reasonably believe the suspect possesses a deadly weapon, and that the suspect poses an immediate threat of serious bodily injury to the officer or others. In a statement made through his lawyer, Officer Rolfe said he did use reasonable force because he “heard a sound like a gunshot” and fearing for his safety and the safety of others, he “fired” his weapon. The description of a gunshot doesn’t square with what Rolfe told investigating police at the scene. And minutes before this, Rolfe appears to have been aware that Brooks fired the Taser twice. This and other evidence will be scrutinized in what has now become a homicide investigation. Rolfe has been charged on 11 counts, including felony murder, and both officers with aggravated assault.

Understanding what went wrong, he said, is a crucial step in helping the police do their jobs better and ease tensions with communities of color.

As the officers moved to arrest Mr. Brooks, whose Breathalyzer test registered a .108, above the legal limit to drive in Georgia, he bolted from their grasp, hit an officer, grabbed the other’s Taser, fired it, and took off running. 

Officer Garrett Rolfe discharged his own Taser and reached for his 9-millimeter Glock handgun as Mr. Brooks turned and discharged the stolen Taser again. Officer Rolfe fired, striking Mr. Brooks twice in the back.

Mr. Brooks was 18 feet and 3 inches away when the first shot was fired. Prosecutors said that as Mr. Brooks lay dying, Officer Rolfe kicked his bleeding body and the other officer, Devin Brosnan, stood on his shoulder. Neither offered medical assistance for more than two minutes, prosecutors said.

On Wednesday, the Fulton County district attorney, Paul L. Howard Jr., charged Mr. Rolfe, who had been fired from the Atlanta Police Department, with 11 criminal counts, including murder and aggravated assault. Officer Brosnan, who is on administrative duty, was charged with three counts, including aggravated assault and violations of oath.

The decision to file charges came five days after the fatal encounter, which has led to the resignation of the city’s police chief and the mayor’s announcement of a series of measures to overhaul how and when police officers use force. The shooting came amid nationwide protests over police brutality and systemic racism that followed the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. 

President Trump weighed in briefly this week, telling Sean Hannity of Fox News that people should not resist police officers. He also said he hoped Mr. Rolfe “gets a fair shake because police have not been treated fairly in our country.”

Some observers have said the shooting death of Mr. Brooks could have been avoided if the two officers, who are white, had declined to arrest him. According to the footage from Officer Brosnan’s body camera, Mr. Brooks maintained that he had not had more than two drinks that night. 

But he also made a suggestion: “I can just go home.”

It seemed like a simple request. “Why didn’t they just let him go home?” Mr. Brooks’s father, Larry Barbine, asked in an interview with The Toledo Blade.

Dr. Ture, a former law enforcement officer, said he likely would have written a citation but not taken Mr. Brooks to jail, particularly given the presence of the coronavirus in many detention facilities. 

“I’d have said, ‘Mr. Brooks, I’ll offer you a ride wherever you want to go, however, I’m going to take your vehicle keys,’” Dr. Ture said. “If I was so concerned I might even tow the vehicle. But I might not even take Mr. Brooks to jail.”

But other experts said that for decades, the police have been told that society wants law enforcement to take a zero-tolerance approach to drunken driving, the No. 1 cause of death on U.S. roadways. 

“Like with so many other social problems, we put officers at the forefront of dealing with D.U.I.,” said Seth Stoughton, a former police officer who teaches law at the University of South Carolina. “So it should be no surprise that officers arrest someone for D.U.I. That’s what we’ve been telling them to do for a long time.”

Vince Champion, the southeast regional director for the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, the Atlanta police union, said there were limits to an officer’s discretion. 

Mr. Champion said he once let an inebriated driver walk home a short distance and the man was struck and killed. His supervisor, who had approved the move, was demoted, he said. Such episodes can lead to lawsuits. 

“We’ve had to go away from trying to be nice,” he said. 

After Mr. Brooks went through a field sobriety test and the Breathalyzer test — both of which came after he was unable to identify which county he was in and gave a seemingly implausible explanation about how he had arrived at the Wendy’s — Mr. Rolfe decided to arrest him.

“All right, I think you’ve had too much to drink,” he said, moving to cuff Mr. Brooks, according to the video footage. “Put your hands behind your back for me.”

In his news conference announcing the criminal charges against the officers, Mr. Howard said they had violated the Police Department’s policy because Mr. Brooks “was never informed he was under arrest for driving under the influence.”

Verbally notifying people that they are about to be arrested accomplishes multiple goals, experts say. It is a way to show respect and courtesy, which increases public confidence in the police. And it is also tactical — it helps slow the interaction down to eliminate surprises. 

When people are not told what to expect — particularly intoxicated people — they can react in ways that an officer might misinterpret as resisting, when in fact the person is simply startled. 

“In many situations, officers should tell someone what is happening because you don’t want the person to react in surprise and the officers to take that surprise as resistance,” Professor Stoughton said.

When Mr. Brooks lurched away from the two officers as they moved to cuff him, they hung on, and the three fell into a heap on the pavement, fighting and struggling. 

Video footage shows Mr. Brooks seizing a Taser from Officer Brosnan, and striking Officer Rolfe. In a statement this week, the lawyers representing Officer Brosnan said Mr. Brooks used the Taser on their client at around this point.

After a few moments, Mr. Brooks broke free of the officers. As Mr. Brooks ran away, Officer Rolfe fired a Taser at him, a violation of department rules that prohibit firing at a fleeing suspect, prosecutors said.

Seconds later, mid-stride, Mr. Brooks turned and fired the Taser at Officer Rolfe, who was close on his heels. 

Three gunshots can be heard, and Mr. Brooks falls.

Mr. Howard said that Officer Rolfe, before opening fire, must have known that the Taser that Mr. Brooks had taken had already been fired twice — and that this model of Taser was only capable of two shots. 

Several policing experts agreed that Officer Rolfe should have known that Mr. Brooks was not a deadly threat, but for other reasons. 

Mr. Brooks was running, and it seemed like escaping the situation was his only goal, some experts said. And although Georgia officers are taught that Tasers are a deadly threat because they can disable officers long enough for their guns to be seized, that threat is diminished when a second officer is present as backup. 

Use of force should be proportional to the threat, the experts said. 

But whether the officer should have known how many times the Taser had been fired — or could have reacted quickly enough to that knowledge — was a separate question. 

“That’s a high expectation in the middle of a fight, that an officer is going to know every single fact that we get to see after the fact with an analysis of the video,” said Roberto Villaseñor, a former police chief in Tucson, Ariz., and a member of former President Barack Obama’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing. 

“There’s a lot of things that occur in a dramatic, volatile situation that you might not be aware of,” he continued. “You have adrenaline pumping, you’ve got fear working, you’ve got the fight-or-flight syndrome going on — you’ve got a lot of things that are affecting your perceptions.”

Noah H. Pines, a lawyer for Mr. Rolfe, said in a statement this week that the shooting was justified, and that the responsibility was squarely at Mr. Brooks’s feet. 

“When Mr. Brooks chose to attack two officers, to disarm one of them,” Mr. Pines said in the statement, “he took their lives, and his own, into his hands. He took the risk that their justified response might be a deadly one.”

But on CNN on Monday, Stacey Abrams, Georgia’s former Democratic candidate for governor, called it “murder.” 

“At no point did he present a danger that warranted his death,” she said of Mr. Brooks. “And that’s what we’re talking about. A murder because a man made a mistake, not a mistake that would have cost the police officer his life but a mistake that was caused out of some form of dehumanization of Rayshard Brooks.”

"
Former Atlanta Officer Is Charged With Murder in Shooting of Rayshard Brooks,"[Here’s what you need to know about the death of Rayshard Brooks.]

ATLANTA — A former Atlanta police officer was charged on Wednesday with murder and aggravated assault in the killing last week of a black motorist outside a fast-food restaurant, and prosecutors revealed chilling new details of the late-night encounter, including that the officer kicked the dying man after shooting him twice in the back.

The former officer, Garrett Rolfe, faces a total of 11 charges in connection with the death of the motorist, Rayshard Brooks. The shooting, which was captured on a widely circulated video, has prompted the resignation of Atlanta’s police chief and further inflamed the tensions over race and policing that are roiling the nation.

At a news conference on Wednesday to announce the charges, prosecutors said that Mr. Rolfe declared, “I got him,” after firing the fatal shots at Mr. Brooks. Mr. Rolfe kicked the victim, prosecutors said, while his partner stood on the fatally wounded man’s shoulder.

Mr. Rolfe and his partner, Devin Brosnan, both of whom are white, then failed to render aid for more than two minutes, said Paul L. Howard Jr., the Fulton County district attorney.

Officer Brosnan, who remains on the police force on administrative duty, was charged with three counts, including aggravated assault and violations of oath, Mr. Howard said, adding that Officer Brosnan is cooperating with prosecutors in the investigation.

The killing took place on Friday night, after the police were called to a Wendy’s restaurant where Mr. Brooks, 27, had fallen asleep in his car in the drive-through line, the authorities said.

In announcing the charges against the officers, Mr. Howard said that “Mr. Brooks never presented himself as a threat.” In fact, while Mr. Brooks appeared “slightly impaired,” Mr. Howard said, “his demeanor during this incident was almost jovial.”

Then, after a long interaction that was “cordial and cooperative,” Mr. Brooks failed a sobriety test and the officers began to arrest him, prompting Mr. Brooks to tussle with them, grab one of their Tasers and bolt.

“For 41 minutes and 17 seconds, he followed their instructions, he answered questions,” Mr. Howard said, adding that Mr. Brooks was not informed that he would be arrested for driving under the influence, a violation of the Police Department’s policy.

Officials from the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, the union representing Atlanta officers, denounced the charges against both officers as premature and politically motivated, as Mr. Howard is locked in a tight re-election race. They said prosecutors should have waited until the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which is leading an investigation into the shooting, announces its findings.

The G.B.I. said in a statement on Wednesday that the agency had not been consulted by prosecutors before they brought the charges. “Although we have made significant progress in the case,” the G.B.I. said, “we have not completed our work.”

Shortly after the charges were announced, Mr. Brooks’s family said they appreciated the quick response by prosecutors, but that they were also anguished as they imagined the pain and cruelty Mr. Brooks faced after falling to the ground.

“I was told as a kid that you don’t kick a man when he’s down,” Justin Miller, a lawyer representing the family, said during a news conference on Wednesday. “What you saw and what we all saw is one officer standing on a man who is dying, standing on top of him, and then the other officer literally kicking him while he’s on the ground dying.”

President Trump defended Mr. Rolfe in a televised interview Wednesday evening.

“You can’t resist a police officer, and if you have a disagreement, you have to take it up after the fact,” Mr. Trump told the Fox News host Sean Hannity. “It was out of control — the whole situation was out of control.”

“I hope he gets a fair shake,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Rolfe, “because police have not been treated fairly in our country.”

A spokesman for the Atlanta police said that an unusually high number of officers called in sick and did not report to work night shifts on Wednesday after the charges were announced.

Within 24 hours of the shooting of Mr. Brooks, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said that she did not believe it was justified, leading to Mr. Rolfe’s prompt firing and the resignation of the city’s police chief, Erika Shields.

But as protesters swarmed the streets with renewed intensity, including burning the Wendy’s where the shooting took place, demands swelled to bring criminal charges against the officers.

Mr. Brooks’s name was soon invoked in demonstrations across the country alongside other African-American people who died in violent encounters with the police, including George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. Rashad Robinson, president of the civil rights advocacy group Color of Change, said charges were largely possible because of the “millions of people who protested all over the country for justice.”

Legal experts said that the charges came surprisingly quick, and were significant for their severity, with punishment that could extend to life in prison or even the death penalty if Mr. Rolfe is convicted.

“These are hefty, hefty charges,” said Jimmy Gurulé, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame and a former federal and state prosecutor.

The swiftness, he said, reflected a sense of urgency fueled by recent protests and broader efforts to shine a light on shortcomings in the criminal justice system.

“There’s a realization that these aren’t simply unrelated cases of police brutality,” Professor Gurulé said. “I think there’s an awareness of a serious problem with policing in this country.”

Prosecutors said they benefited from videos and photographs that clearly detailed the shooting and the interaction between Mr. Brooks and the officers, including videos taken by bystanders and footage from the officers’ body and dashboard cameras. 

Mr. Howard said he also heard from witnesses, including one man, Melvin Evans, whose sport utility vehicle was hit by one of the officer’s bullets.

Mr. Evans, who had traveled to Atlanta from Memphis, was sitting with his girlfriend and a friend while the confrontation unfolded. He said they ducked after the officer opened fire.

“He was, like, 10 feet away from the truck,” Mr. Evans said of Mr. Brooks. “It was that close.”

Mr. Rolfe had disciplinary issues in the past, including a written reprimand in 2016 for another use-of-force incident involving a firearm, according to records released by the Atlanta Police Department. The disciplinary history does not include details of that case, nor those of a number of other episodes in which Mr. Rolfe was involved since his hiring in 2013.

Among the other cases were four citizen complaints, none of which resulted in disciplinary action, and five vehicle accidents, which led to an “oral admonishment” in 2014 and a written reprimand in 2018.

Mr. Rolfe’s record also includes an incident in August 2015 involving the discharge of a firearm, but there is no record of any disciplinary action taken in that case.

Before Mr. Brooks’s death, Officer Brosnan had not faced any disciplinary actions, according to the department.

The law office representing Officer Brosnan issued a statement Wednesday, saying that while the officer was cooperating with the Fulton County prosecutors’ investigation, he had not agreed to testify against Mr. Rolfe or to plead guilty to any charges.

“This was not a rush to judgment — this was a rush to misjudgment,” the firm, Garland, Samuel & Loeb, said in its statement.

During the struggle between Mr. Brooks and the officers, the statement said, Officer Brosnan pulled out his Taser and warned Mr. Brooks to stop resisting, “or he would be tased.” The statement said Mr. Brooks instead took the Taser and used it on Officer Brosnan, who hit his head on the pavement and was later found to have a concussion.

The statement also said that Mr. Rolfe ran to his car to get medical equipment for Mr. Brooks within “less than a minute.”

Videos of the confrontation between Mr. Brooks and the officers began circulating in a moment when Atlanta was already gripped by boiling discontent over the racial biases and discriminatory practices that bleed into virtually every facet of life for African-Americans.

As protests were touched off across the country by the death of Mr. Floyd, amid a pandemic that has disproportionately affected African-Americans, the demonstrations in Atlanta were especially heated.

Anger with the Atlanta Police Department deepened after a live television broadcast during one night of protests captured a scene of officers swarming two college students in a car, physically pulling a woman out of the passenger seat and firing a Taser at a man in the driver’s seat.

A day after that incident, Ms. Bottoms and Ms. Shields condemned the officers’ actions, announcing that two had been fired and three had been assigned to desk duty. This week, Ms. Bottoms, who is black, announced a series of measures aimed at overhauling the Police Department, including how and when officers are allowed to use deadly force.

Kansas City Police Investigate Vandalism of Memorial to Lynching Victim,"The authorities are investigating the vandalism of a sign that memorialized a Missouri man, Levi Harrington, who was lynched in the 1880s, the police in Kansas City, Mo., said on Monday.

A spokesman for the police, Sgt. Jake Becchina, said that no one had reported the incident to the police, but that they were now looking into it after being notified by news reports.

The navy blue and gold sign was removed from its post and tossed over a small wall and down a cliff, according to photos posted on social media and local news outlets.

The sign was unveiled in 2018 by community leaders and the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit legal advocacy group, in West Terrace Park to memorialize Mr. Harrington, “a well-respected African-American man who lived with his wife and five children near Kansas City,” according to the marker.

It details how, on April 3, 1882, after a police officer was fatally shot in the city, black residents were targeted. As Mr. Harrington traveled through the city that day, the police arrested him, although they lacked evidence for his involvement in the shooting, the marker said.

“An angry white mob quickly formed and grew to several hundred people intent on lynching Mr. Harrington,” the memorial said. The mob hanged Mr. Harrington from a beam of a bridge and shot him. “Although newspapers reported that Mr. Harrington was innocent of the accusations against him, no one was held accountable,” the sign concludes.

The memorial was erected by the Community Remembrance Project of Missouri, which works with the Equal Justice Initiative to recognize victims of lynching by collecting soil from lynching sites and creating markers. The reverse side of the sign contains a history of lynching in the United States. Researchers for the Equal Justice Initiative have documented more than 4,000 lynchings between 1877 and 1950. 

“In the context of protests throughout the country and locally in Kansas City to decry the killing of George Floyd and demand reform of police practices, it is shocking to see a monument dedicated to acknowledging the horrific lynching endured by another unarmed African-American man in Kansas City brutalized,” the Community Remembrance Project said in a statement on Monday. “To intentionally cut down the marker and throw it down the hill represents a rejection of historic and current truths.”

In a separate statement, the Equal Justice Initiative said it was “in no way deterred from our commitment to helping communities confront the history of racial injustice represented by lynchings of black people by white mobs.”

“That symbols designed to promote understanding and repair are targets of vandalism and violence just reinforces the need for this project,” it said.

The sign and other memorials like it have been targeted before. In 2019, someone defaced the Kansas City marker with graffiti. A sign posted just outside Glendora, Miss., in memory of Emmett Till has been repeatedly struck by bullets.

“This is a sacred space,” Rod Chapel, the president of the Missouri N.A.A.C.P., said after the Harrington sign was vandalized in 2019. “We do not take its defacement lightly. It is part of our continuing struggle to acknowledge our history and advocate for a better future. We do not deface churches or graveyards or other holy places.”

The damage to the Harrington memorial comes as protesters, outraged by the death of Mr. Floyd and other black people killed by the police, have directed some of their frustration toward monuments that they consider to be symbols of racism and oppression, such as statues of Confederate leaders and Christopher Columbus.

Some of the monuments have been spray-painted, toppled, or removed by the authorities, and, in two cases, statues were dragged into a lake and decapitated."

On Friday night, June 12, an employee at a Wendy’s restaurant in South Atlanta calls 911. A 27-year-old man named Rayshard Brooks had fallen asleep in his car in the drive-through lane.

At 11:39 p.m., 15 minutes after he’s shot, an ambulance takes Rayshard Brooks to a hospital where he is later announced dead. Was Rolfe justified in shooting a man holding a Taser, and who was trying to escape? Police procedures on the use of deadly force state that an officer must reasonably believe the suspect possesses a deadly weapon, and that the suspect poses an immediate threat of serious bodily injury to the officer or others. In a statement made through his lawyer, Officer Rolfe said he did use reasonable force because he “heard a sound like a gunshot” and fearing for his safety and the safety of others, he “fired” his weapon. The description of a gunshot doesn’t square with what Rolfe told investigating police at the scene. And minutes before this, Rolfe appears to have been aware that Brooks fired the Taser twice. This and other evidence will be scrutinized in what has now become a homicide investigation. Rolfe has been charged on 11 counts, including felony murder, and both officers with aggravated assault.

Garrett Rolfe, the former Atlanta police officer who has been charged with murder and aggravated assault in the killing of a black man outside a fast-food restaurant last week, turned himself in to the authorities on Thursday. 

Mr. Rolfe, who was fired from the police force the day after the shooting, faces a total of 11 charges in connection with the death of the man, Rayshard Brooks, which was captured on a widely circulated video. The killing prompted the resignation of Atlanta’s police chief and further inflamed the tensions over race and policing that are roiling the nation. 

Prosecutors said on Wednesday in announcing the charges that Mr. Rolfe had declared, “I got him,” after firing the fatal shots at Mr. Brooks, and that as Mr. Brooks lay on the ground, Mr. Rolfe kicked him; Mr. Rolfe’s partner, Devin Brosnan, stood on his shoulder, prosecutors said. 

The officers, both of whom are white, did not render any aid to Mr. Brooks for more than two minutes, said Paul L. Howard Jr., the Fulton County district attorney.

Officer Brosnan, who was charged with three counts, including aggravated assault and violations of oath, remains on the police force on administrative duty and is cooperating with prosecutors in the investigation.

Officials from the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, the union representing Atlanta officers, denounced the charges against both men. After the charges were announced, an unusually high number of officers in Atlanta did not show up to work evening shifts. 

There were suggestions that the sickout protest by officers could continue on Thursday, and a union official described morale on the force as “terrible.” 

In an effort to improve morale, the Atlanta Police Foundation, a nonprofit group, said on Thursday that it would distribute a $500 “bonus” to every officer. 

The group, which finances programs to improve policing, support officers and reduce crime, said in a statement that it would also provide meals to officers who work 12-hour shifts and would pay to repair or replace more than 20 patrol cars damaged during recent protests. 

In a Twitter post Thursday, the police department said it “was able to respond effectively to 911 calls” despite the absences.

The killing took place on Friday night, after the police were called to a Wendy’s restaurant where Mr. Brooks, 27, had fallen asleep in his car in the drive-through line, the authorities said. Officer Brosnan woke him up, and the encounter remained calm for some time, until the officers started to arrest Mr. Brooks after he failed a sobriety test. 

Video images of the encounter showed that at that point, he struggled with the officers, broke away and ran, and was shot twice in the back as he fled. 

The Air Force inspector general is investigating whether the military improperly used a little-known reconnaissance plane to monitor protests in Washington and Minneapolis this month, the Air Force said on Thursday.

The inquiry was apparently prompted by lawmakers who expressed concerns to Pentagon officials that the use of military surveillance airplanes may have violated the civil liberties of protesters demonstrating against police violence after George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis.

“Following discussions with the secretary of defense about shared concerns, the secretary of the Air Force is conducting an investigation into the use of Air National Guard RC-26 aircraft to support civil authorities during recent protest activity in U.S. cities,” Brig. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, the chief Air Force spokesman, said in response to questions from Eric Schmitt and Thomas Gibbons-Neff of The New York Times.

In a statement, General Ryder declined to address any other questions, pending completion of the investigation led by Lt. Gen. Sami D. Said, the Air Force inspector general.

The Air Force’s action comes days after the Pentagon’s top intelligence policy official told Congress that the nation’s military intelligence agencies did not spy on American protesters during the wave of nationwide demonstrations.

In a letter last week to the House Intelligence Committee, Joseph D. Kernan, the under secretary of defense for intelligence and security, said he had received no orders from the Trump administration to conduct such surveillance, and he underscored citizens’ constitutional right to protest peacefully.

The deployment of more than 5,000 National Guard members to the nation’s capital, and thousands more to cities across the country to help quell the civil unrest, has cast a harsh spotlight on the National Guard’s response to the protests. Last week, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper ordered a review of the National Guard’s response. 

The Southeastern Conference on Thursday demanded that Mississippi remove the Confederate battle emblem from its state flag, linking one of the region’s greatest passions — college sports — with one of its most intractable debates.

Greg Sankey, the league’s commissioner, said in a statement that it was “past time for change to be made to the flag.”

“Our students deserve an opportunity to learn and compete in environments that are inclusive and welcoming to all,” Sankey said. Without change, the commissioner warned, the conference might not hold future championship events in Mississippi.

The SEC’s condemnation of the flag came hours after a state board approved the University of Mississippi’s plan to relocate a Confederate monument on its campus in Oxford. The university has struggled through years of arguments over symbols of the Old South, leading to bans of the battle flag and the song “Dixie” and the elimination of the “Colonel Rebel” mascot. 

But the university’s nickname, “Ole Miss,” remains a subject of criticism, and its athletes are still known as the Rebels.

Gov. Tate Reeves of Mississippi, a Republican, said Thursday that he would consider proposals to change the flag, but he stopped short of clearly endorsing any one idea.

“I’m certainly open to having any conversations,” Reeves said before Sankey’s statement. “But I believe very strongly that if we’re going to change the flag, the people of Mississippi should be the ones who make that decision.” In a 2001 referendum, Mississippi voters overwhelmingly endorsed keeping the flag.

Earlier on Thursday, the University of Florida’s president said its band and athletic teams would no longer use their “Gator bait” cheer. “There is horrific racist imagery associated with the phrase,” the president, Kent Fuchs, wrote in an open letter. 

After prosecutors said that a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on George Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds, that number became a grim symbol of police brutality. At memorials for Mr. Floyd, mourners stood in silence for eight minutes and 46 seconds. Activists have walked and run 8.46 miles in Mr. Floyd’s memory, and lawmakers in Washington knelt for eight minutes and 46 seconds.

The precise length of time that Mr. Floyd was pinned beneath the officer’s knee, however, is no longer as exact.

This week, prosecutors in Hennepin County said they had misstated by one minute the amount of time that had passed as the officer, Derek Chauvin, held his knee to the neck of Mr. Floyd. The misstatement had come as part of the criminal complaint against Mr. Chauvin, who has been fired; the actual time, a spokesman for the county prosecutor said, was seven minutes and 46 seconds.

Yet the revised time provided by prosecutors conflicts with videotapes obtained by The New York Times after the May 25 killing along a Minneapolis street. The videos show Mr. Chauvin’s knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for at least eight minutes and 15 seconds.

The precise time element, activists said, is irrelevant; the act was horrific.

“It makes no difference,” said Jamar Nelson, who works with the families of crime victims in Minneapolis. “The bottom line is, it was long enough to kill him, long enough to execute him.” 

Minnesota legislators are struggling to find agreement on proposals to change policing after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, with the governor warning that lawmakers risk reaching the end of the Legislature’s special session on the issue this week with nothing to show.

Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, said on Thursday that proposals advanced by Republicans who control the State Senate were “weak sauce.” He encouraged them to incorporate proposals from the Democratic-controlled House that go farther to restrict police use of force and make it easier to punish officers who cross the line.

Mr. Walz said that there would be a “poetic justice” in signing new measures into law on Juneteenth, the holiday celebrating the end of slavery, which falls on Friday. But he said that failing to agree on a substantial bill by then would be a letdown for the thousands of people who have taken to the streets in Minnesota since Mr. Floyd’s death last month.

“The image of us and the Senate walking away from systemic change on Juneteenth adds to the legacy of what the rest of the world is looking at here,” Mr. Walz said. “It is unacceptable.”

Republicans have said the governor’s push to pass a bill this week is arbitrary and that Democrats are ignoring their proposals. They are also wary of handing more power over cases of police killings to the attorney general, Keith Ellison, as the Democratic legislation would do.

“We think he’s partisan, and we don’t think he’s the right guy to have more powers,” Paul E. Gazelka, the Republican Senate majority leader, said this week.

Governor Walz said he dreaded the prospect of the deadlock lasting until the election in November, but he acknowledged that it could happen.

“If it’s a choice, and we get to a dead end, that’s maybe what happens,” he said. “But here’s what I think about: Think about all of the bad that will happen between now and then. Think about this lost opportunity.”

 

In a news conference on Thursday, Minneapolis’s mayor, Jacob Frey, and the city’s police chief, Medaria Arradondo, called on state legislators to approve a proposed statute that would abolish the arbitration system that has often allowed police officers to return to work after being fired for using excessive force. 

The measure would override police union contracts and any other mitigating policies, revoking the authority of arbitrators to reverse or lessen sanctions imposed by a police chief when it has been demonstrated that an officer provided an untruthful statement, did not report an incident involving the use of force, exercised unreasonable force, or failed to intervene when another officer did so. 

Joined by the mayors of a number of surrounding communities, Mayor Frey said passing the legislation into law was a necessary first step toward changing the culture of policing, and ultimately uprooting systemic racism across the state.

“It’s been mentioned before that culture eats policy for breakfast,” Mayor Frey said. “To get the full structural change that we know we need in Minnesota and in cities throughout our state, we must also be focusing on a shift of culture.”

As protesters and state and city leaders call for the removal of Confederate monuments and other statues associated with colonialism and slavery, they will run into a difficult issue that has been building for years: What to do with the statues. 

It is a question that often has no easy answer.

Sometimes a buyer or institution ready to take the statue can be found. Dallas sold the city’s bronze statue of Robert E. Lee for $1.4 million in an online auction in 2019. But New Orleans’s Lee statue has been sitting in storage since it was removed from public display in 2017. 

John J. Tecklenburg, the mayor of Charleston, S.C., said on Wednesday that the city intended to take down the city’s towering 110-foot monument to John C. Calhoun, a slaveowner who was vice president from 1825 to 1832 and remained one of the South’s most influential advocates for slavery and states’ rights until his death in 1850.

But William Dudley Gregorie, a Charleston City Council member, said officials did not yet know where they would put the statue once it is taken down. Until the city finds a long-term home for it, officials may keep it in storage, Mr. Gregorie said. 

The Southern Poverty Law Center says 106 Confederate monuments and symbols have been removed across the country since 2015, when a white supremacist gunman killed nine black worshipers at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. 

Some who want the problematic statues removed say they belong in museums, where they can be shown with appropriate context. But Sheffield Hale, president of the Atlanta History Center, said museums often do not want them, for a variety of reasons. For one thing, the statues tend to be too large to fit comfortably inside their buildings. And even when there is ample space, Mr. Hale said, curators hesitate to take in a statue or monument that has been at the center of heated controversy. 

“At a minimum, they’re off-putting, and perhaps toxic,” he said.

Controversy over statues of figures associated with slavery and colonialism continued to simmer on Thursday. San Francisco took down a statue of Christopher Columbus, while a judge in Richmond, Va., indefinitely extended an injunction barring the governor from removing that city’s Robert E. Lee statue, one of a number on Monument Avenue depicting Confederate leaders. 

City officials in San Francisco had the statue of Columbus that stood near Coit Tower placed in storage, for now at least. And two city commissions have been given the job of wrestling with yet another thorny question: What should take its place? 

transcript

Tomorrow is Juneteenth, a day that we observe as a day of freedom in our country. It was a day that people in the West found out about the Emancipation Proclamation. In observance of that, I have sent a letter, which you will see, to the clerk of the House directing the clerk to remove the portraits of four previous speakers of the House who served in the Confederacy. There is no room in the hallowed halls of this democracy, this temple of democracy, to memorialize people who embody violent bigotry and grotesque racism of the Confederacy.

The portraits of four House speakers who served the Confederacy were taken down at the Capitol on Thursday, a day before the Juneteenth holiday celebrating the end of slavery in the United States. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California ordered their removal earlier in the day.

Democrats in the Senate also took aim at other symbols of the Confederacy on Thursday. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey attempted through a procedural maneuver to win unanimous approval for legislation to remove statues of Confederate officials from Capitol Hill. His effort was blocked by a Republican who asked for more time to examine the issue.

“There is no room in the hallowed halls of Congress, or in any place of honor for memorializing men who embody the violent bigotry and grotesque racism of the Confederacy,” Ms. Pelosi wrote in a letter to the House clerk ordering that the portraits be taken down.

The portraits are of Robert M.T. Hunter of Virginia, Howell Cobb of Georgia, James L. Orr of South Carolina and Charles F. Crisp of Georgia. Mr. Crisp served in the Confederate army as a young man and went into politics in the 1870s; the others were in Congress before the Civil War, and then held high civilian office in the Confederacy. 

In her letter, Ms. Pelosi pointed to remarks by Mr. Orr, who swore on the House floor to “preserve and perpetuate” slavery, as well as Mr. Hunter’s service as secretary of state in the Confederate government, as examples of why their portraits should be removed.

As Speaker, Ms. Pelosi has unilateral power over portraits in the House, but removing a statue from the Capitol requires the approval of a bipartisan congressional committee.

That committee’s chairman, Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, was the senator who blocked Mr. Booker’s move. Mr. Blunt also chairs the Senate Rules Committee. 

“It would have the effect of abandoning agreements that we have entered into with the states and the states have entered with us,” Mr. Blunt said of Mr. Booker’s proposal, citing a procedure that allows each state to select two statues to represent it on Capitol Hill. “This is a more complicated arrangement than the activity on the floor today would suggest.”

Mr. Blunt noted that several states were already moving to replace statues of Confederate officials or soldiers in the Capitol, without intervention by Congress. He said he understood Mr. Booker’s concerns and would be glad to hold discussions on his proposal.

The police in Portland, Ore., said on Thursday morning that they had successfully cleared out a small area of the city that protesters had occupied overnight in the hope of carving out an “autonomous zone” under their control, similar to the one in Seattle. 

Several hundred protesters had gathered Wednesday evening outside Mayor Ted Wheeler’s condominium in the Pearl District, an affluent neighborhood known for art galleries and restaurants. They barricaded several streets with dumpsters, wooden pallets, trash cans and other material, and declared the area the “Patrick Kimmons Autonomous Zone,” after a black man who was killed by police officers in 2018.

A group called the Pacific Northwest Youth Liberation Front said it was demanding that the case surrounding Mr. Kimmons’s death be reopened, as well as the abolition of the Portland police. They referred to the city as “the stolen land we call Portland.”

By morning, though, the group had dwindled to about 50 people, according to the police. At 5:30 a.m., the police declared the occupation an unlawful assembly and instructed anyone who did not live in the area to leave or face arrest. The remaining protesters, who by that time were outnumbered by the authorities, left peacefully, the police said.

Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, Democrat of Texas, is calling for a federal investigation into the recent hangings of a Hispanic man and a black teenager in the Houston area. Her request comes after a series of hangings across the United States that have attracted national attention, including some in which relatives are disputing initial rulings that the deaths were suicides.

“These cases must be thoroughly investigated and proven beyond a reasonable doubt,” Ms. Lee said in a statement.

The Houston police responded on Monday to a report that the body of a Latino man had been found hanged outside a store in the city’s Shady Acres neighborhood. The authorities initially said there appeared to be no signs of foul play. Chief Art Acevedo of the Houston Police said on Twitter that the man’s family had described him as suicidal.

On Tuesday, the Harris County Sheriff’s Office said a black teenager had been found hanged outside an elementary school in Klein, Texas, north of Houston. The Sheriff’s Office said the death appeared to be a suicide.

Ms. Lee, a Democrat who represents parts of the Houston area, noted that these deaths came at a time of heightened tensions following the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis last month.

“People are on edge,” she told a Houston TV station. “They are nervous. This is a very troubling and challenging time for us.”

The families of two black men — Robert L. Fuller and Malcolm Harsch — who were found hanged from trees in Southern California in recent weeks are challenging preliminary rulings that their deaths were suicides.

The F.B.I. said on Monday that it was “actively reviewing the investigations” into the deaths of Mr. Fuller and Mr. Harsch, in conjunction with federal prosecutors. The sheriff of Los Angeles County, Alex Villanueva, said his office’s homicide bureau would lead the investigation into Mr. Fuller’s death. 

President Trump said in an interview that “nobody had ever heard” of Juneteenth, the holiday celebrating the end of slavery, until he “did something good’’ and made it “very famous.” 

He also acknowledged that his Twitter message about “shooting” looters was intended as a threat.

In the interview, conducted in the Oval Office on Wednesday and published Thursday by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Trump said he learned what Juneteenth was from a black Secret Service agent after his campaign scheduled a campaign rally — his first since the coronavirus pandemic began — for the date of the holiday, June 19.

The timing was instantly criticized, and so was the city chosen to host the rally: Tulsa, Okla., the site of a bloody 1921 massacre of black people, and destruction of their businesses, by white mobs.

Mr. Trump was urged by officials in Oklahoma and by black leaders to change his plans, which he did last week, rescheduling the Tulsa rally for the following day.

“I did something good: I made Juneteenth very famous,” Mr. Trump told The Journal. “It’s actually an important event, an important time. But nobody had ever heard of it.”

He told the paper he had asked a number of aides if they were familiar with the holiday, and none said they were. Then he asked an adviser who was with him during the interview; the adviser noted that his administration put out a statement honoring the day in 2019.

“Oh really? We put out a statement? The Trump White House put out a statement?” Mr. Trump asked. “OK, OK. Good.”

Mr. Trump was asked about his tweet in response to protesters setting fire to the police station in Minneapolis where the officer charged with killing George Floyd, an unarmed black man, had worked. 

The tweet included the sentence, “When the looting starts, the shooting starts!” — echoing a phrase used in 1967 by Walter Headley, the Miami police chief, as he began a crackdown on young black men during unrest in the city.

The Journal reported that Mr. Trump had no regrets about the tweet, which he has since said was meant as a factual observation that episodes of looting often lead to gunfire. 

The president told The Journal that it could be read either as fact or as a threat, and when asked about his intention in writing it, he replied, “A combination of both.”

"After Virtual Graduation, Protesting for Their Lives","Daavion Lee sported a Kelly green cap and gown, and his cousin Daniyah Bennett wore the black regalia from her middle school. They stood in the back of a pickup truck with an organizer of a march against police brutality and racism.

“These two have graduated, and they are the future of our community,” the organizer yelled into a megaphone. The graduates lifted their balled fists in the air, and the crowd erupted.

Just hours earlier on Saturday in Milwaukee, Ms. Bennett, 15, and Mr. Lee, 18, had finished their virtual graduation ceremonies. Now they were at their first protest.

For over two weeks, protests have cropped up in small towns and in large cities across the nation and around the world. The killing of George Floyd — who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes 46 seconds — set off the social unrest.

Canceled graduations, closed businesses and job losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic have fueled protesters and given students the time to participate, sometimes draped in their unused caps and gowns. Their photos from the protests make for powerful imagery that they hope conveys how they feel: that they should not inherit the same discrimination that their grandparents faced.

“My great-great-grandma was a slave,” Mr. Lee said. “I understand why my mom is still protesting about this.”

Mr. Lee graduated from Alexander Hamilton High School and Ms. Bennett from the Garland Elementary School, both in Milwaukee. They were both excited about reaching their milestones, but that joy was eclipsed by their need to stand up for what they believe in.

“I thought everyone should see that everyone can graduate, no matter the color of your skin,” said Mr. Lee, who will take a test to join the Army in June. “It’s scary as a black man just living in a world of chaos where people treat other people wrong because of their skin. They don’t understand us behind it.”

Outbursts of violence, fires and looting have occurred during some protests, which is why Mr. Lee’s mother initially did not want him to attend one after his graduation.

“I understand that they think that the protests are going to get out of hand,” Mr. Lee said. “If other people could live in someone else’s skin or shoes and see how they feel and how they are treated, then they will understand why people protested.”

Deveonte Joseph, 17, posed in his royal blue cap and gown, bluejeans and icy white sneakers during a Minneapolis protest after graduating from Community of Peace Academy in St. Paul, Minn. In the photo, Mr. Joseph stands in the foreground while police officers in gas masks appear behind him. The officers congratulated him on his graduation, he said.

“That scene right there is history,” Mr. Joseph said.

He is the first boy out of his nine siblings to graduate from high school. Mr. Joseph wants to go to art school, but his family cannot afford it.

The marches have revealed, to many, the expansive inequalities in America that black and brown people in the United States contend with daily.

Black Americans face income gaps with their white counterparts, lower wages, lower college graduation rates and lower high school graduation rates.

Police violence usually affects black and brown people disproportionately. Officers who are caught — sometimes on video — beating or killing people unjustifiably are rarely punished.

“With everything going on in America, there is so much systematic change that has to happen,” said I’ziae Frazier, 18, who graduated from the Vicenza American High School in Italy on Saturday.

After her virtual graduation ceremony, Ms. Frazier went straight to the Piazza dei Signori, where a protest against police brutality and racism was underway.

“It is really frustrating what has been going on for centuries in America,” Ms. Frazier said. “I wanted to protest and speak to people and voice my opinion of why the system needs to change so badly. I feel the pain of my ancestors and my great-grandparents.”

Ms. Frazier, whose mother is in the Army, has lived in Italy for two years, but she spent most of her early teenage years in San Antonio. She plans to attend Howard University in the fall to study television and film.

At the protest in Italy, she saw signs that read “I Can’t Breathe” and “Black Lives Matter,” and one with Mr. Floyd’s face painted on it, she said. Excerpts from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech played. Organizers also played the video of Mr. Floyd’s last moments on the Minneapolis pavement.

“It was hard to endure,” Ms. Frazier said. “I felt sick to my stomach. It was heart-wrenching because you knew it could be anyone. No one sees what we go through until it is on video and we have to be re-traumatized. How many times do we have to cry out for help?”

Black students feel an intense disappointment at the moment, said Monnica Williams, the Canada research chair for mental health disparities at the University of Ottawa’s School of Psychology.

“This gives them an opportunity to assert their independence and individuality in a way that they couldn’t for graduation,” Dr. Williams said. “There are so many stereotypes of black people of being unintelligent, and now they have the chance to go out and say, ‘I just graduated and I’m black and I am standing up against racism.’”

“I think it is a very proud thing for them,” she added. “They are using their success to push back.”

Tesia Walker, 17, was very proud to graduate but prouder to use her right to protest by heading to the streets of Los Angeles after she graduated from Palisades Charter High School.

“We are finding ways to exercise the rights that we do have,” Ms. Walker said. “Protesting is putting in my best efforts because I don’t really have a lot of money to donate, so I am doing the best I can.”

Ms. Walker is headed to Howard University in the fall to study to become a nurse. She hopes that the work she does makes the world a better place for future generations of black Americans.

“You always think someone else is going to do it, but as you go on living, you realize the problem isn’t solved,” Ms. Walker said. “It keeps recurring. It never ends. You have to do something yourself.”

“My generation realized we have to step out,” she said. “We are the future, and we have to make a change now if we are going to have a better future for our kids.”"
Racial Justice Groups Flooded With Millions in Donations in Wake of Floyd Death,"The killing of George Floyd and the ensuing nationwide wave of protests are generating a record-setting flood of donations to racial justice groups, bail funds and black-led advocacy organizations across America, remaking the financial landscape of black political activism in a matter of weeks.

Money has come in so fast and so unexpectedly that some groups even began to turn away and redirect donors elsewhere. Others said they still could not yet account for how much had arrived. A deluge of online donations has washed over organizations big and small — from legacy civil rights groups to self-declared abolitionists seeking to defund the police.  

Black leaders and activists said it was a landmark moment in which a multiracial coalition protesting systemic racism and police brutality not only marched together, showed solidarity on social media and drove books about racism up the best-seller charts but also opened their wallets — especially during a pandemic that has driven 40 million people from their jobs and created one of the sharpest economic downturns in American history.

“To see millions of people give millions of dollars creates hope out of this moment,” said Glynda C. Carr, the president of Higher Heights, a group dedicated to building the political power of black women and which saw a spike of 15,000 donations in two weeks — about 10 times more than usual. “In the end, not everybody went out and protested,” she said. “This was a way to participate.”

ActBlue, the leading site to process online donations for Democratic causes and campaigns, has experienced its busiest period since its founding in 2004, far surpassing even the highest peaks of the 2020 presidential primary season. (ActBlue confirmed that racial justice causes and bail funds had led the way.) The site’s four biggest days ever came consecutively this month as it processed more than $250 million to various progressive causes and candidates in two-plus weeks, according to a New York Times analysis of the site’s donation ticker.

And on June 2, the collective action day that was known as Blackout Tuesday, ActBlue doubled what had been, before this month, its one-day record: raising $41 million in 24 hours.

“Is it a moment or is it a movement? I’m feeling like it’s a movement,” said Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League. “It’s organic and spontaneous and global.”

At the forefront of the giving wave were bail funds, as millions of Americans spontaneously gave money to ensure that any protesters who were arrested in clashes with the police got out of jail quickly. Leaders of two national networks said bail funds had received a combined $90 million over two weeks — an astonishingly large sum for a cause that had operated at the periphery of politics only recently.

Some of the leading black and racial justice groups declined to comment on the scope of their windfalls, including the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the Black Lives Matter Global Network, whose name became a national rallying cry.

“This is a watershed moment for all black-led organizing groups,” said Kailee Scales, managing director of the Black Lives Matter Global Network, who did reveal that one of her group’s online petitions alone had raised $5 million. “It is the moment when our allies and individuals have joined our call for justice.” It is also, she added, a time of “mixed emotions,” after the killing of Mr. Floyd and other black Americans that had “brought people around the globe to their knees.”

Another person familiar with the group’s fund-raising said that it had raised $10 million just on Blackout Tuesday; Ms. Scales declined to comment on that figure.

Few expect the largess to last. As the protesters recede, so too will the donations, leaders predicted. But group after group now has a far larger base of supporters to draw upon for donations going forward. Several black leaders brushed aside concerns that the sudden influx of funds might be squandered, especially by undersized groups suddenly flush with cash, because the needs are so big.

“Black-led nonprofits and civil rights nonprofits — we’re all stretched against the world we’re supposed to fix and the issues we’ve been involved in and sometimes the people we’re up against,” Mr. Morial said.

Color of Change, which already promoted itself as the largest online racial justice group in the country, quadrupled its membership from 1.7 million to 7 million people in recent days.

Rashad Robinson, Color of Change’s president, said the group had received “hundreds of thousands of individual donations” — far more than any previous period — and called it a “rallying cry for us to grow and continue the work.”

Despite a policy of not taking corporate donations, so much unsolicited corporate money poured into Color of Change’s accounts in recent days that the group’s board is still trying to tally up the totals. The board has created what it calls an Emergency Fund for Racial Justice to redistribute those corporate donations, in partnership with the Amalgamated Foundation, to other black-led groups.

But as rubber bullets flew and images of tear gas-filled police clashes played out nightly on cable news, nothing became the progressive cause du jour quite like bail funds.

Pilar Weiss, the director of the National Bail Fund Network, an umbrella group that links together independent community bail funds, said millions of people had donated an estimated $75 million to her network’s funds in the past two weeks. Robin Steinberg, the chief executive of a different national group, the Bail Project, said the organization had received an additional $15 million.

Sharlyn Grace, executive director of the Chicago Community Bond Fund, said, “The support we’ve received is not really about us as a bail fund but support for the Black Lives Matter movement and support for protesters who are taking the streets forcing this national reckoning.”

The outpouring has been organic, viral and immense.

In Brooklyn, N.Y., a bail fund received $1.8 million from 50,000 contributors — in only 24 hours — before asking donors to give elsewhere. In Philadelphia, the bail fund hauled in $2.4 million. And in Los Angeles, one GoFundMe page for the local chapter of Black Lives Matter zoomed past $2 million raised, and another for a previously undersized group, the People’s City Council, leapt from $1,500 raised to $2.3 million.

Crowdsourced memorial funds for the families of Mr. Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, who was gunned down this year in Georgia, and Breonna Taylor, who was killed by the police inside her home in Louisville, Ky., have amassed more than $23 million. The Floyd memorial broke GoFundMe’s record for most contributions, with nearly 500,000. 

Some of the most intense giving has been to groups in Minnesota, where Mr. Floyd was killed and where the protests began. One neighborhood rebuilding project quickly raised $6.2 million from 62,000 contributors. Another group, Women for Political Change, that supports younger women and transgender individuals, netted $219,000 from a GoFundMe page.

Reclaim the Block, which wants to defund the police, did not previously have an office or paid staff, according to Tony Williams, a member of the group. He said the group raised at least $1 million in recent days, though he did not know the exact sum.

“I’m reasonably sure it’s in the single-digit millions because if it passed $10 million I think someone would have said, ‘Holy heck!’” he said. “It’s a sign of the complete transformation that’s happening in the national dialogue right now.”

The Minnesota Freedom Fund, a cash bail fund, raised a stunning $20 million in four days at the end of May before redirecting donors elsewhere (including to Reclaim the Block). Another $10 million came in anyway — from nearly one million individuals, according to the group’s volunteer treasurer, Steve Boland.

The $30 million total haul is nearly 300 times what it raised in its previous full year’s tax filing.

For some perspective on just how many donors that is, it took Senator Elizabeth Warren’s grassroots-funded presidential campaign more than 13 months to reach the million-donor milestone. The presumptive Democratic nominee for president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., has a total of 1.6 million unique contributors almost 14 months into his candidacy, according to his campaign.

Mr. Biden, too, has seen a significant spike in fund-raising of late as he invested $5 million into Facebook ads in the first week of June — spending more in a few days than he did in the first 10 months of his campaign, a sign of how much donors were responding. More than 1.2 million people joined his email list in a week.

There is some precedent for massive giving at cultural inflection points. In mid-2018, as the Trump administration was separating families at the border, a single Facebook fund-raiser for the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services in Texas went viral, raising $20 million in a few days.

But that was one fund-raiser and one group, not the vast array of organizations that have experienced recent windfalls, including the activists and advocates as well as some of the journalism outlets that cover them.

One tiny group in Chicago, Equity and Transformation, which serves black people left behind in the economy, saw a dormant GoFundMe page go freshly viral, raising $44,000. “We’ve never had that kind of resources,” Richard Wallace, the founder, said.

Unicorn Riot, an alternative media company that closely covered the early Minneapolis protests, blew past an initial $5,000 online fund-raising goal by a factor of 100, raising $570,000, according to the site’s online tracker. And The Marshall Project, a Pulitzer Prize-winning nonprofit news organization that reports on the criminal justice system, saw its membership double, from 4,000 to 9,500, according to Carroll Bogert, the group’s president.

“We’re just sitting here doing our jobs and donations started skyrocketing,” she said.

The energy to contribute is so vast that even those without money have sought ways to contribute, including watching videos on YouTube that promise to direct every dollar of revenue to racial justice causes.

“I wish I could give money — I can’t, I’m broke,” said Zoe Amira, a 20-year-old who lives outside Chicago and posted an ad-laden video that was viewed more than nine million times, generating $42,000 — before it was yanked for violating ad policies. She later said on Twitter that YouTube told her it would make a donation of an equal size because it “so believed in the essence of the project.”

Celebrities — Chrissy Teigen, Lady Gaga, Leonardo DiCaprio, among others — have joined and amplified the giving, too. One pop singer, Abel Tesfaye, known as The Weeknd, posted receipts for $500,000 in donations. And the K-pop boy band BTS announced giving $1 million to Black Lives Matter; its fan group matched that by donating $1.3 million to a dozen advocacy groups.

Big corporations are making major pledges: $100 million each from Warner Music Group, Comcast and the Sony Music Group for various social justice causes, among many companies.

Small donors are powering the moment. Aidan King, an unemployed Democratic digital strategist, created a portal on ActBlue to allow people to simultaneously donate to dozens of bail funds and other racial justice groups. That single page has processed $16.5 million from more than 215,000 individuals in two weeks.

“It’s this horribly tragic and heartbreaking but also, in a way, beautifully perfect storm for activism and solidarity,” Mr. King said.

Ms. Carr, the leader of Higher Heights, said she saw many white friends and colleagues in her own network giving to black-led groups for the first time.

“People,” she said, “are being inspired by the moment.”"
"Why Andrea Jenkins Is Somber, but Optimistic","This article is part of our latest Pride special report, featuring L.G.B.T.Q. voices on the challenges and possibilities of these troubled times.

Andrea Jenkins has been making daily visits to the site where a police officer knelt on George Floyd’s neck for almost nine minutes. It’s not even two blocks from where she lives in South Minneapolis, where she is a councilwoman representing Ward 8. In 2017, Ms. Jenkins won with about 73 percent of the vote, becoming the first black, openly transgender woman to be elected to public office in the United States.

She ran on a platform of racial equity, prioritizing affordable housing issues, environmental justice and police accountability. Thirteen days after Mr. Floyd’s death, the Minneapolis City Council, where Ms. Jenkins serves as vice president, pledged to dismantle the police department.

Growing up in Chicago in the 1960s, Ms. Jenkins was steeped in the city’s emerging Black Arts Movement and discovered her voice as a poet. She eventually moved to Minneapolis and served as a Council policy aide and oral historian for nearly two decades before becoming a city councilwoman. “That’s where I live, at the intersection of L.G.B.T. politics and racial injustice,” Ms. Jenkins said in a phone interview. “It’s front and center of my everyday.”

These are edited excerpts from our conversation earlier this month.

I wanted to talk about your platform of racial equity. 

It hasn’t changed. The urgency of my methods was as hopeful and necessary as it is today. The problems that led to George Floyd being murdered have been present in Minneapolis, in Minnesota, in the United States of America, for a very, very long time. Since the beginning of this country.

Iyanna Dior, a black transgender woman, was beaten recently. Is there anything that’s being done to protect trans women?

CeCe McDonald was brutally attacked in this community in 2011 as well. And in defending herself, subsequently went to jail and was, with even further indignity, placed in a male facility. We are trying to keep people safe, but the whole notion of transphobia and racism — society has to wake up and deal with that. Your newspaper has to create messages that help to create understanding and awareness of these issues in these communities. All of us have a responsibility in that.

You won with 73 percent of the vote. Do you feel like there was a willingness for change when you came in?

Black Minnesotans may be doing better than some other communities, but the reality is that the white people in Minneapolis are doing so incredibly well, in terms of homeownership, income. We have the No. 1 parks system in the country. We have the No. 1 education system in the country. We have some of the best health care. This is the home of the Mayo Clinic. People here are working on curing the coronavirus, right? We got it going on. So the heights are so high, that it really exacerbates the gap. But the gaps are real, make no mistake.

People are desperate for change. People are fighting for change. People are willing to put their lives on the line for change. People are laying out in the middle of the street, in the middle of the freeway for change, standing in front of militia-type armies of police law enforcement, sustaining shots of tear gas and rubber bullets. People are ready for change.

What could change look like in the community in the next few years?

I really hope that change can and will look like a reimagined approach to public safety, where we are engaging community members and being able to respond to mental health crises, to domestic violence crises, to some of these heated situations where police officers encounter very, very difficult times. We want to see a new approach to public safety. We want to see a fair and equitable living wage, for people who all are considered now essential workers.

Here in Minneapolis, we do have a $15 minimum-wage requirement. But you can’t live off that in this community. So we need corporations to share the benefits that the work force has been providing for them for years. If you work eight hours a day, you should be able to pay your rent. We need to change the way we approach health care in this country, as we can see as evidenced through the coronavirus, when, if you lose your job, you lose your health care.

How does being a poet and historian inform your work?

I use poetry as a way to try to understand what’s going on around me. So if you read my poetry, it’s not deeply esoteric or contemplated, meditating on the beauty of a dandelion. It’s more dealing with the cultural and social issues that are surrounding us.

The Black Arts Movement informs my poetic sensibilities and, really, it’s the poetics of social justice and social change. It has been mostly focused on, I would say, the intersections of the African-American and people-of-color communities with the L.G.B.T.Q. communities. And through that, poetry has given me a platform to speak to the political and social issues that led me to running for political office.

You were very qualified by the time you ran. So do you also feel like, being a black trans woman, that you had to be above and beyond qualified? 

As a black trans person, I’ve always felt compelled to try and to make sure that my qualifications were stellar and above what might be necessary to have, because most average trans people in this country make less than $10,000, particularly black trans women.

And now you’re the vice president of the City Council. So what does that mean for your day-to-day life? Can you just walk me through what your day is like?

For the first four days of this week, I was on a call every four hours with the governor’s office and the governor’s team. I have hosted a virtual town hall with my constituents. I attended a virtual meeting with Equality Florida to talk about the intersections of blackness and L.G.T.B.Q. identities. I participated in two separate business calls with small business owners to talk about the damages and the response. How are we going to help small business owners recover from Covid-19 and then, added on top of that, the destruction from the unrest that we have been experiencing for the past 11 nights in a row? I have been to the site of the murder of George Floyd every day this week except for today. I did not go there because I’ve been on Zoom the entire day. For, like, the entire day.

I usually write every day. For the past 11 days, I have not been able to journal. So today I was able to make a daily journal entry, and that felt good to be able to just have a moment to recap and to rethink about all of the things that we transpired over the past week. The world has literally changed in the last 10 days, at least my world, let me put it that way.

And how are you taking care of yourself during this time?

Not well, not well. Fortunately for me and my body, I quit smoking and drinking a few years back. I do try to make sure I get some fresh foods in my body, either through smoothies or salads or something like that. The sleeping part has been really challenging. The riots were happening. I was fearful about, and still am, about white supremacists or Antifa. They’re mad at us too. So there’s a bit of concern about my physical safety.

Recently I got a chance to take a walk in the evening, and I had shared a socially distant meal at my mom’s house. 

What is it like going every day to the site where Mr. Floyd died?

It’s surreal. The first day that I did it, I had an anxiety attack. We’ve all been sitting in our homes for weeks by ourselves. The closest contact with humans I had was like looking out the window. But it has been really a peaceful, almost calming kind of scenario at the site. There’s tons of community out all the time.

The artwork is just astonishing. It’s so beautiful. I’m working with our public art department and other property owners to try to preserve those boards that people have been using to protect their businesses. Artists are painting protest images on them, and they’re incredible. So we’re trying to preserve those and see if we can make sure that art is able to live on beyond the protest.

Where would it live, ideally?

It’s one of the things that I want to create, a center for racial healing. That’s where that art should live. It should not live in any white-owned institution that has been collecting and displaying when they determine that it’s a good time to see black art.

I want it right here. I want it to be called the George Floyd Center for Racial Healing or something to that effect.

How are you feeling during Pride month? How are you processing this?

I’m feeling somber. I know in Minneapolis, Pride will be virtual. There will not be parades. And I’m interested to see how that looks. I’m sad that it’s not happening. But I’m really proud of what Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera created — they stood up at Stonewall, and they fought police brutality.

It lets me know that victory does come out of struggle, but it’s a continuous struggle. We are still fighting for L.G.B.T. rights. We are still fighting for women’s rights. We are still fighting for voters’ rights. And we will continue to fight for equity and for human rights for black and brown people. But we are making progress. We are making change. We are making history. And so it leaves me with some optimism, too."
Demonstrations Force America to Reckon With Contentious Past,"This briefing has ended. 

The anger in the days after George Floyd’s killing is fueling a national movement to topple perceived symbols of racism and oppression in the United States, as protests over police brutality against African-Americans expand to include demands for a more honest accounting of American history.

In Portland, Ore., demonstrators protesting police killings turned their ire to Thomas Jefferson, toppling a statue of the founding father who also enslaved more than 600 people.

In Richmond, Va., a statue of the Italian navigator and colonizer Christopher Columbus was spray-painted, set on fire and thrown into a lake.

And in Albuquerque, tensions over a statue of Juan de Oñate, a 16th-century colonial governor exiled from New Mexico over cruel treatment of Native Americans, erupted in street skirmishes and a blast of gunfire before the monument was removed on Tuesday.

Across the country, monuments criticized as symbols of historical oppression have been defaced and brought down at warp speed in recent days. The movement, which initially set its sights on Confederate symbols and examples of racism against African-Americans, has since exploded into a broader cultural moment, forcing a reckoning over issues such as European colonization and the oppression of Native Americans.

“We’re at this inflection point,” said Keegan King, a member of Acoma Pueblo, which endured a massacre of 800 or more people directed by Oñate, the brutal Spanish conquistador and colonial governor. The Black Lives Matter movement, he said, had encouraged people to examine the history around them, and not all of it was merely written in books.

The debate over how to represent the uncomfortable parts of American history is not new, but the extent of the monument-toppling in recent days raises new questions about whether it will result in a fundamental shift in how history is taught to new generations.

An Air Force sergeant linked to the antigovernment “boogaloo” movement and another man were accused on Tuesday of a shooting in Oakland, Calif., last month that left a federal security officer dead and another gravely wounded outside a courthouse. The F.B.I. said they were not protesters but had used the recent demonstrations against racial injustice as a cover to attack law enforcement.

“They came to Oakland to kill cops,” John F. Bennett, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I. in San Francisco, said at a news conference on Tuesday.

Staff Sgt. Steven Carrillo, 32, was accused of firing an assault-style rifle from the open back door of a moving vehicle and gunning down Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, the federal officer killed in the attack, and gravely wounding a second officer. He was charged on Tuesday with murder and attempted murder.

The driver of the van, Robert Alvin Justus Jr., 30, who had met Sergeant Carrillo on Facebook, was charged with aiding and abetting the murder of Mr. Underwood and attempted murder of the second officer.

Evidence tied Sergeant Carrillo to the boogaloo movement, an extremist ideology that seeks to bring about a second civil war to overthrow the United States government. He had expressed his allegiance to the movement by writing with his own blood on the hood of a white Toyota Camry he had carjacked.

He was arrested June 6 after a gun battle with Santa Cruz County sheriff’s deputies that left one deputy dead. He has already been charged in that case.

Sergeant Carrillo is the latest person tied to the movement to be arrested in recent weeks. All of them have sought to exploit protests — first against the coronavirus lockdowns and then around the death of George Floyd — to accelerate their apocalyptic vision.

The term boogaloo, initially derived as an inside joke from the 1984 cult film “Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo,” is used as shorthand on internet forums for a brewing second civil war. 

The former Atlanta Police Department officer who fatally shot an African-American man after a confrontation outside a fast-food restaurant had been issued a written reprimand in 2016 for another use-of-force incident involving the use of a firearm, according to records released by the department.

The disciplinary history of the former officer, Garrett Rolfe, who was fired this weekend after the shooting, does not include details of the 2016 use-of-force case, or other incidents he was involved in since being hired in 2013.

These include four citizen complaints, which resulted in no disciplinary action, and five vehicle accidents, which resulted in an “oral admonishment” in 2014 and a written reprimand in 2018.

Mr. Rolfe’s record also includes an August 2015 episode involving the discharge of a firearm, but there is no record of any disciplinary action taken in that case.

The department also released a file that showed no previous disciplinary record for Devin Brosnan, the other officer who responded to the fast-food restaurant on Friday night after an employee called 911 and complained that Rayshard Brooks, who appeared to be intoxicated and asleep, was blocking the drive-through lane.

Officer Brosnan, who joined the force in June 2019, has been placed on administrative duties pending the outcome of an investigation.

The fatal shooting of Mr. Brooks, 27, prompted demonstrations throughout the weekend in Atlanta, including one on Saturday night in which the Wendy’s restaurant where the shooting occurred was burned down. The city’s police chief, Erika Shields, stepped down in the wake of the incident, and Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced major revisions to the department’s use-of-force policies.

Video recordings show that the two officers engaged Mr. Brooks in a long conversation that appeared to be respectful, and gave him field sobriety and breathalyzer tests. The officers concluded that Mr. Brooks was intoxicated, and when they moved to handcuff him, Mr. Brooks resisted. The three men wrestled on the pavement, and Mr. Brooks emerged with one of the officer’s Tasers. He ran away and fired the Taser at Mr. Rolfe, who was chasing him close behind.

It was at that point that Mr. Rolfe shot him. An autopsy report showed that Mr. Brooks was shot twice in the back.

The Fulton County district attorney, Paul Howard, is investigating the case, but has not announced whether the officers should be charged criminally. On Sunday, he told a CNN reporter that Mr. Brooks “did not seem to present any kind of threat to anyone, and so the fact that it would escalate to his death just seems unreasonable.”

transcript

I’ve just concluded a meeting with incredible families, just incredible families, that have been through so much. The families of Ahmaud Arbery, Botham Jean, Antwon Rose, Jemel Roberson, Atatiana Jefferson, Michael Dean, Darius Tarver, Cameron Lamb and Everett Palmer. These are incredible people. Incredible people. And it’s so sad, many of these families lost their loved ones in deadly interactions with police. To all of the hurting families, I want you to know that all Americans mourn by your side. Your loved ones will not have died in vain. As part of this new credentialing process, chokeholds will be banned, except if an officer’s life is at risk. And I will say, we’ve dealt with all of the various departments and everybody said it’s time. We have to do it. Additionally, we’re looking at new, advanced and powerful less-lethal weapons to help prevent deadly interactions. New devices are being developed all the time, and we’re looking at the best of them.

President Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday to encourage changes in policing, including new restrictions on chokeholds, as Senate Republicans signaled that they were coalescing around a narrow set of law enforcement reforms. But the president’s order will have little immediate impact, and does not address calls from activists and protesters nationwide for broader action and a new focus on racism.

Speaking in the White House Rose Garden and flanked by several uniformed police officials, Mr. Trump depicted police misconduct as rare and police officers as embattled American heroes who must be defended.

The order does not mandate any immediate action; rather, it lays out what a senior administration official called “guiding principles,” to be translated into specifics by the Justice Department and Congress. Mr. Trump said he was “encouraging police departments nationwide to adopt the highest professional standards to serve their communities.”

Mr. Trump said the Justice Department would “prioritize” federal grants to police departments that follow “the highest training standards regarding the use of force.” He said that would include banning chokeholds except when a police officer’s life was in danger.

He added that the federal government would “provide more resources” for other kinds of professionals, like social workers, to accompany police officers on calls involving matters like mental health, substance abuse and homelessness.

Mr. Trump said he met privately just before the event with the families of nine black men and women whose deaths have stoked protests. They included relatives of Ahmaud Arbery, who was killed near Brunswick, Ga., in February, as well as those of Botham Jean, Antwon Rose, Jemel Roberson, Atatiana Jefferson, Michael Dean, Darius Tarver, Cameron Lamb and Everett Palmer Jr.

Mr. Trump said he would “fight for justice for all of our people,” but he said nothing in his remarks about police racism, and scoffed at calls for major systemic changes to policing.

“I strongly oppose the radical and dangerous efforts to defund, dismantle and dissolve our police departments,” Mr. Trump said, adding, “Americans want law and order, they demand law and order.”

At least 98 law enforcement agencies — many in large cities — used some form of tear gas against civilians protesting police brutality and racism in recent weeks, according to an analysis by The New York Times. This brief period has seen the most widespread domestic use of tear gas against demonstrators since the long years of unrest in the late 1960s and early ’70s, according to Stuart Schrader of Johns Hopkins University, who studies race and policing.

“Thousands and thousands of utterly ordinary people who thought they were going to an ordinary protest event are finding themselves receiving a really aggressive police response,” he said. “That itself is a bit horrifying. The police have actually succeeded in making people more angry.”

Tear gas has long been used to disperse crowds during protests and riots, both nationally and internationally, despite being banned in warfare by the Chemical Weapons Convention.

If used appropriately, it drives people to flee the gas, which irritates their eyes, skin and lungs without causing serious, long-term injuries in most. But in cases where law enforcement misuses the agent, it can cause debilitating injuries.

The widespread use of tear gas has prompted pushback, with some lawmakers calling for a ban of its use in Massachusetts and New Orleans. Other cities, including Denver, Seattle, Dallas and Portland, Ore., have all temporarily banned the police from using tear gas. 

The deployment of tear gas against civilians has not been this widespread since the period of unrest in the 1960s and ’70s, according to a New York Times analysis.

At the request of the mayor, the police chief of Richmond, Va., resigned on Tuesday, after officers reportedly fired chemical irritants and rubber bullets at protesters who had gathered outside Police Headquarters on Sunday and Monday.

The former chief, William C. Smith, was sworn in less than a year ago and has faced sharp criticism in recent weeks as protests erupted in the state capital. Richmond, the former capital of the Confederacy, has been at the forefront of a national debate over whether to remove statues of Confederate leaders.

Michael Jones, a City Council member, called the harsh police response to the protests “unacceptable.” Another City Council member, Stephanie Lynch, said on Twitter that she had taken part in a demonstration on Sunday, and that the police had fired tear gas and rubber bullets at peaceful protesters.

In a news release, Mayor Levar Stoney said he had appointed Major William Jody Blackwell as the interim chief.

Mr. Stoney said he expected the Police Department to help reimagine its own role in the city, echoing calls across the country for police reform in the weeks since the police killed George Floyd in Minneapolis.

Documents relating to the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by three white Louisville police officers in March, are being withheld by the city, according to lawyers for Ms. Taylor’s mother.

Protesters against police violence across the country have expressed rage over the death of Ms. Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician who was killed after police officers used a battering ram to force their way into her apartment in the middle of the night. The officers were executing a “no-knock” search warrant as part of a narcotics investigation.

Ms. Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired on the officers, hitting one of them in the leg. That officer and two others then fired back, hitting Ms. Taylor at least eight times. Whether the police identified themselves before bursting through the door is in dispute; Mr. Walker has said that he believed they were intruders. The city has since banned “no-knock” warrants.

Tamika Palmer, the mother of Ms. Taylor, filed a wrongful-death suit in April against the three officers. Her lawyers, Lonita Baker, Sam Aguiar and Benjamin Crump, said on Tuesday that the mayor’s office had been directing other city agencies not to comply with their subpoenas related to the lawsuit.

They pointed to three missed deadlines on Friday: The Louisville coroner’s office failed to hand over its autopsy report, they said; the Louisville Metro Police Merit Board did not turn over personnel files for the three officers; and Mayor Greg Fischer did not supply all of his correspondence relating to the investigation into Ms. Taylor’s death. All three gave the records to the city counsel’s office but not to them, the lawyers said.

“Actions speak louder than words,” the lawyers said in a statement. “Of all the cities dealing with the tragedies of officer-involved shootings and violence inflicted upon black lives, Louisville’s administration has been the least transparent, the slowest and the most frustrating.”

A spokeswoman for the mayor did not respond to a request for comment.

Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia said on Tuesday that he would propose legislation to make June 19 — known as Juneteenth — a paid holiday for state workers.

Juneteenth, also known as Freedom Day or Emancipation Day, commemorates the day in 1865 when news of President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation reached enslaved people in Texas. Virginia was the leading state in the Confederacy, whose capital was Richmond; Texas was its most remote member.

“This symbol, this holiday, is one step toward reconciliation,” the governor said on Tuesday. “It is a step toward the Virginia we want to be as we go forward.” He said he believed that only one other state had made Juneteenth a paid holiday.

Mr. Northam, a Democrat, faced a wave of criticism and calls for his resignation last year after a photo in a 1984 medical school yearbook surfaced, showing him and another student in racist costumes — one in blackface and the other in a Ku Klux Klan outfit.

The governor apologized, but declined to resign. Since then, he has focused much of his time on race-related issues. During the news conference on Tuesday, he highlighted those efforts, including expanding a state commission on racial equity and removing a statue of Robert E. Lee in Richmond.

France has partly backtracked from banning chokeholds by law enforcement officers, after angry protests by police unions, which argued that the police needed the technique to safely carry out some arrests.

Christophe Castaner, the country’s interior minister, said this week that chokeholds would be banned after thousands of people across the country protested racism and police violence following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

Mr. Castaner said police academies would no longer teach the technique, which involves putting pressure on the neck to subdue a person who is resisting arrest. He did not specify at the time whether officers already in the field would still be allowed to use it, and many police unions objected to banning it.

Frédéric Veaux, the national police chief, confirmed in a letter that the move would no longer be taught to new recruits in police academies. But he clarified that officers could still use it “with restraint and discernment” and “when circumstances require it” — in situations in which a person is aggressive or threatening — until a working group comes up with an alternative.

The group is expected to present its findings by September. Police officers are still allowed to grab suspects from behind to bring them to the ground.

Cédric Chouviat, a delivery driver, died in January shortly after a police stop in Paris that escalated, during which officers pinned him to the ground and, according to one witness, put him in a stranglehold.

‘It’s Something I Wanted to Carry With Me’: Marking a Movement in Ink,"MINNEAPOLIS — After George Floyd died in police custody in Minneapolis last month, Dashinque Hall watched her city become the center of a protest movement.

“My wife was able to go and protest, and I couldn’t because of work,” she said. “So I kept on thinking about how I can do my part to support.”

While sketching one day, Ms. Hall, a tattoo artist, had the idea to offer discounted tattoos with movement-related slogans like “I can’t breathe” and “Black Lives Matter.” When she announced it on Facebook, the requests came flooding in.

“It was surprising how many people wanted these tattoos,” Ms. Hall said.

She plans to donate the proceeds to Gianna Floyd, Mr. Floyd’s daughter.

Customers who got the tattoos did so for a variety of reasons. Three of Ms. Hall’s clients spoke about why they wanted to memorialize this moment on their bodies.

Rikaya Wafford wanted to create a memory to look back on.

“I got this tattoo that says ‘I can’t breathe,’ because it’s a statement that reflects what our community is going through now,” Ms. Wafford said. “I feel like this statement and moment is going to carry on with me. So why not have it carried on my body to represent how prolific this moment was, and the changes that it caused for us?”

“The phrase ‘I can’t breathe’ started a new revolution. People are opening their eyes and change is being made,” Terace Diver said. “It’s something I wanted to carry with me. This is a symbol of representation. I’ve been feeling proud. We are standing up for ourselves.”

For Briana Joyner, growing up in a mixed community meant being singled out by law enforcement.

“I got this tattoo because I had my fair share of times dealing with white cops that have profiled me and treated me differently from my white friends,” Ms. Joyner said. “I grew up in the suburbs, so I’ve been in this situation time and time again.”

“I just wanted this tattoo on my body as a representation to say that if you don’t stand for something, you’ll fall for anything.”"
Atlanta Mayor Tightens Rules on When Police Can Use Force,"ATLANTA — In the wake of the death of a black motorist by a white Atlanta police officer, the city’s mayor announced on Monday a series of changes aimed at dramatically overhauling how the Police Department uses force.

De-escalation techniques will now be required before an officer employs deadly force, said Keisha Lance Bottoms, the city’s first-term mayor, and officers will be “duty bound to intercede” when they see other officers engaging in unreasonable applications of force. The city’s 2,000-plus officers also will be ordered to use only the “amount of objectively reasonable force” to protect themselves and others so that they can make an arrest or bring an incident under control.

“It is clear we do not have another day, another minute, another hour,” Ms. Bottoms, who is black, said of the executive orders, which came on the heels of the resignation over the weekend of the city’s white police chief and the termination of the officer who shot and killed the 27-year-old motorist, Rayshard Brooks.

Ms. Bottoms, like many other U.S. mayors, has struggled to seek a balance between law and order and compassion for the demonstrators that have flooded American streets since the death of George Floyd, an African-American man killed last month when a Minneapolis police officer restrained him with a knee to his neck for nearly nine minutes.

The death on Friday night of Mr. Brooks, in the parking lot of a Wendy’s restaurant, prompted a weekend of angry demonstrations in Atlanta that included the burning of the restaurant, and amplified a growing chorus of voices calling for a national re-evaluation of when the police should be allowed to use deadly force.

The nationwide effort to tighten the rules governing when and how police officers should use deadly force gained momentum after the 2014 police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and has picked up steam since the killing of Mr. Floyd. Significant changes in use-of-force policy have been adopted by state and city governments as some protesters continue to call for police departments to be defunded or abolished.

The recent uproar over policing reflects a marked shift away from a decades-long reality in which police officers have been given considerable leeway in making split-second decisions to use lethal force.

Before announcing the efforts in Atlanta, Ms. Bottoms had already organized a task force charged with mapping out a potential overhaul of the department’s use-of-force policies. Shean Williams, a lawyer who has brought police brutality suits against the Atlanta Police Department and was named a member of the task force, praised the mayor’s new orders, saying that they were a “substantial step toward actual change.”

Mr. Williams said the current policy left too much ambiguity over what was considered reasonable force and lacked a rigorous system to hold officers accountable for their actions. He said that many in the community had lost trust in the Police Department.

“Her executive order is a steppingstone toward rebuilding that trust,” Mr. Williams said. “She has an opportunity and the city has an opportunity to be the light for this nation on progressive police reform.”

Vincent Champion, the southeast regional director for the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, a union that includes the Atlanta force, said that the policies Ms. Bottoms outlined did not appear to be a departure from those currently in place.

And he assailed her for describing Mr. Brooks death as a “murder,” which she did during the news conference, saying that it maligned officers while the shooting remained under investigation.

The sustained protests across the country in the weeks since Mr. Floyd’s death have prompted a nationwide reckoning with racism that extends far beyond questions of policing. And in Georgia, Mr. Brooks’s killing was the latest in a series of recent controversies that have reminded residents of the worst injustices of the past.

Last week, the state’s primary election was marred by a meltdown of a new computerized voting system that forced many people to wait in line for hours to cast a vote. In South Georgia, the killing in February of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man, by white men who told the authorities they thought he was a burglary suspect, has echoed with the dark history of Southern lynchings.

On Monday morning, hours before Ms. Bottoms spoke live on national television, thousands of demonstrators peacefully took to the streets of downtown Atlanta to decry those perceived injustices and call for solutions, including the repeal of the state’s citizen arrest statute and the passage of a statewide hate-crimes bill. Georgia is one of four states without such a law.

“On June 12, one of our biggest fears became our reality. Not only did we lose another black, unarmed male, this time it landed on our front doorstep. Not only are we hurt, we are angry. When does this stop? We’re not only pleading for justice, we’re pleading for change.” “Rayshard Brooks, the name that may start a protest tomorrow or another day in the future. However, the man himself no longer has a future. He can no longer live in the present nor plan for tomorrow. How many more protests will it take — to ensure that the next victim isn’t your cousin, your brother, your uncle, your nephew, your friend or your companion — so that we can finally end the suffering of police excessive force?”

The roster of speakers in the majority-black city included local politicians and boldfaced names with Atlanta roots, including the hip-hop artist Jeezy. Lloyd Pierce, head coach of the Atlanta Hawks, the city’s N.B.A. franchise, spoke with raw emotion of his pride in being black as members of the team stood silently behind him onstage, their faces obscured by masks in an effort to protect against the spread of the coronavirus.

Mr. Pierce said he would die a black man. “But I don’t want to die because I’m a black man,” he added.

Late Monday morning, the family of Mr. Brooks gathered for a news conference in which they laid bare their anguish and grief. Mr. Brooks’s niece, Chassidy Evans, said she had watched a video of his killing Saturday morning that had circulated around social media without initially knowing that the man was her uncle.

“Not only did we lose another black, unarmed male,” Ms. Evans said. “This time, it landed on our door step.”

According to the police account, two officers responded to a 911 call about a motorist who was asleep in his car and blocking the drive-through lane. Their initial conversations with him were respectful and even intimate, with Mr. Brooks describing how he had been celebrating a daughter’s birthday earlier in the night.

After failing field sobriety and breathalyzer tests, one of the officers told Mr. Brooks they had to arrest him, according to video footage of the incident. But at the moment they tried to place him in handcuffs, Mr. Brooks tried to get away. He and the officers wrestled on the pavement, and then Mr. Brooks escaped with one of the officer’s Tasers in his hand.

Garrett Rolfe, the now fired police officer, chased close behind, and while Mr. Brooks was running, he lifted the Taser toward Mr. Rolfe and fired it. Mr. Rolfe pulled his handgun from its holster and fired. Mr. Brooks fell as cars idled in the drive-through lane.

On Saturday, as tensions in the city mounted, Ms. Bottoms criticized the shooting. She called for the firing of Mr. Rolfe, who is white, and announced that the chief, Erika Shields, would be replaced by an interim chief, Rodney Bryant, who is African-American.

The other police officer, Devin Brosnan, has been placed on administrative duty, officials said. Paul Howard, the local district attorney, is investigating the shooting but has not yet said whether charges would be brought in the case.

Mr. Bryant, the interim chief, appeared with Ms. Bottoms at the news conference, dressed not in a police uniform, but in a dark suit and bow tie. He spoke briefly, but the moment was dominated by Ms. Bottoms, whose name has been floated as being under consideration as a potential running mate for the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, Joseph R. Biden Jr.

Ms. Bottoms spoke with passion of the pain Mr. Brooks’s shooting had caused her, and on occasion fought back tears. Her father, Major Lance, was a minor R&B star who had spent time in prison on drug charges, and Ms. Bottoms has often spoken of her family’s story as she has sought to make criminal justice changes a key policy goal.

On Monday, it was no different.

“My anger and frustration matches theirs,” she said of the protesters. “The difference is that I am using the bully pulpit that I have as mayor to effectuate long-lasting change in the city.”"
"Cup Foods, a Minneapolis Corner Store Forever Tied to the Death of George Floyd","MINNEAPOLIS — Scorn for the brown brick corner store keeps pouring in: “They call the cops on black people,” one person says in an online business review. “Racially profiled a man.” “Disgusting.”

The outrage is aimed at Cup Foods, a neighborhood market in South Minneapolis where a teenage clerk called 911 to report that George Floyd had bought cigarettes using a fake $20 bill. Mr. Floyd was sitting in a parked car just outside the store when a white police officer responding to the call pinned Mr. Floyd’s neck to the asphalt for nearly nine minutes.

“People were saying we were responsible for his death, that we had blood on our hands, that we’re the reason he died,” said Mahmoud Abumayyaleh, an owner of the market.

Now, Cup Foods has become indelibly connected to the police killing of a black man that set off weeks of protests and a national reckoning over racism in policing and in many other parts of American life.

On Monday, Cup Foods reopened its doors for the first time since protesters poured into the neighborhood. The deli was again stocked with fresh vegetables and meat, but the newspapers on the rack were precisely three weeks old — the last editions before Mr. Floyd’s death began to dominate every front page.

The air inside was still and customers were scarce in the morning. A newly hired security guard paced in and out of the building. Inside, signs commemorated Mr. Floyd and declared that “Getting arrested shouldn’t be a death sentence.”

In the weeks since Mr. Floyd’s killing on May 25, mourners have sought to transform the pavement and sidewalks outside the store into hallowed ground. They have left hundreds of bouquets, hung banners and signs and painted a mural of his face on the store’s exterior walls.

The vigils and protests echo scenes from the Triple S Food Mart in Baton Rouge, La., where the police killed Alton Sterling in 2016, and the Ferguson Market and Liquor in Missouri, where a report of a “stealing in progress” precipitated the police killing of Michael Brown in 2014. Over the weekend in Atlanta, protesters burned down the Wendy’s where a white police officer had shot and killed Rayshard Brooks, a black man who had aimed a Taser at an officer while running away.

For more than 30 years, Cup Foods has been a neighborhood mainstay but also a source of complaints at the corner of Chicago Avenue and 38th Street in South Minneapolis.

“Cup Foods is the hub,” said Rashad West, the owner of Dragon Wok, a restaurant across the street whose surveillance video captured part of Mr. Floyd’s arrest. “This is like their block.”

It is a lifeline where customers, Mr. Floyd among them, bought cigarettes, fresh produce and more minutes for their cellphones. Neighbors said they swung by to pick up cilantro and limes for tacos, and adults remember spending childhood hours playing the Street Fighter II arcade game there. Mr. Abumayyaleh said his family was on a first-name basis with many customers.

But it is also a place where shootings have erupted nearby and undercover officers have surveilled patrons. Amid reports of rising crime more than 20 years ago, the Police Department urged the store to call 911 on people loitering outside. In the 1990s, the police reported spotting a series of drug sales around the store, and the Minneapolis City Council tried at one point in 2000 to revoke Cup Foods’s business licenses.

As the neighborhood began to gentrify and barbershops and clothing stores closed as a cafe and art spaces moved in, Cup Foods — the name originally stood for “Chicago Unbeatable Prices” — did not budge.

Mr. Floyd’s apartment in the suburb of St. Louis Park was about a 20-minute drive from Cup Foods, but he often visited the store to buy cellphone credits at the market’s MetroPCS counter. Eric Hardin, a friend, said Mr. Floyd knew many of the store’s employees.

“He’d been going there for years,” said Mr. Hardin, who called Mr. Floyd by the nickname Slim. “Any problems with his phone he would take it to them and get a resolution. Slim was comfortable with those people.”

In an interview, Mr. Abumayyaleh provided new details of the moments before Mr. Floyd’s fatal encounter with four Minneapolis Police officers, saying that another man had tried to use a fake $20 bill minutes before Mr. Floyd walked into the store.

The first man handed the bill to an older employee who had worked at the shop for several years and used a special marker to determine that the bill was counterfeit, Mr. Abumayyaleh said. The employee refused the sale and handed the bill back to the man, who left.

A few minutes later, Mr. Floyd walked in and gave a $20 bill to a teenage clerk, who did not immediately recognize the bill as fake. After a machine scan determined that the bill was counterfeit, the young clerk followed Mr. Floyd outside, asking him to return the items he had bought, but he refused, according to a transcript of the clerk’s call to 911.

“He’s only been in the States for about a year,” Mr. Abumayyaleh said of the teenage clerk, who is no longer working at the store. “It’s his first time probably ever calling the police.”

Mr. Abumayyaleh, who is Palestinian-American and has spent all of his 35 years in Minneapolis, said he had left the store about three hours before the killing. It had been a busy day, like most Mondays, Mr. Abumayyaleh recalled, but he was used to that. The store had always been in his family, and by age 10, he was helping out behind the counter. By 15, he was working there full time.

That night, just after 8 p.m., an employee called Mr. Abumayyaleh, crying and screaming, saying, “they’re killing him,” he recalled. He said he told the employee to record the scene and “to call the police on the police.”

Since then, Mr. Abumayyaleh said, he has been bombarded with hateful messages. He asked a member of a local violence prevention group to serve as a spokesman and issued a public statement condemning Mr. Floyd’s killing and saying that the store supported the protesters and shared their rage.

Things have been even worse for the teenage clerk, Mr. Abumayyaleh said, describing the aftermath as “a nightmare.” He also said that Cup Foods has been rethinking when its workers should call the police. Mr. Abumayyaleh said they will now only call 911 to report violence.

Mr. Floyd’s death was not the first time that Cup Foods has been drawn into a killing that drew national scrutiny.

When a 17-year-old boy went on trial for the 2002 killing of an 11-year-old girl, he insisted he was at Cup Foods and not at the scene of the crime. Senator Amy Klobuchar was the district attorney in Hennepin County who oversaw the first prosecution of the teenager, Myon Burrell, and an investigation by The Associated Press raised serious questions about the verdict and shadowed her presidential campaign.

Investigators never followed up with two people whom Mr. Burrell said he was with at Cup Foods during or following the shooting. Both told The A.P. they were with him.

Since the killing of Mr. Floyd, several residents have said they support the store and its owners. On Monday, Kendrick White, 26, arrived at the store to connect with some friends, something he has done for years.

“You see brothers, sisters, cousins, people from the neighborhood,” Mr. White said. “There are people who grew up here who have been coming here their whole lives.”

But everything had changed. The streets were barricaded off, and many nearby businesses were still closed. Visitors snapped photos as they wandered around the memorials and wilting flowers.

“We respect the fight, but it’s emotionally draining for those of us who have been in the heart of it,” said Ebony Wright, 38, who lives not a block away from the store and has been kept awake by people shouting into megaphones and playing music from speakers. “People who come down here don’t realize that there are people who actually stay here.”

Video Shows Black Man Pleading ‘I Can’t Breathe’ During 2019 Arrest in Oklahoma,"The Oklahoma City Police Department this week released video of the arrest of a black man last year in which he can be seen pinned on the ground, saying, “I can’t breathe,” and an officer replies, “I don’t care.” The man died in custody shortly afterward.

The man, Derrick Scott, 42, was arrested on May 20, 2019, when officers confronted him after receiving reports that someone was brandishing a firearm, Capt. Larry Withrow said at a news conference on Tuesday. Mr. Scott had a loaded gun in his pocket, Captain Withrow said.

A medical examiner’s report released in August lists Mr. Scott’s probable cause of death as a collapsed right lung, and cites physical restraint, recent methamphetamine use, heart disease and emphysema as contributing factors. The manner of death is “unknown,” it says.

Video of the arrest, captured by police body cameras, was released this week after Mr. Scott’s family and a local Black Lives Matter group demanded more details about his death.

It has quickly bolstered calls to reform the tactics that police officers use during arrests. Mr. Scott’s plea of “I can’t breathe” echoed some of the last words of George Floyd, a black man whose death after being pinned by an officer in Minneapolis last month has set off worldwide protests over police brutality and racism.

They were also some of the last words of Eric Garner, who died in 2014 at the hands of the police in Staten Island after pleading “I can’t breathe” 11 times during his arrest.

On Thursday, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund tweeted news of the newly released video of Mr. Scott’s arrest and said, “We must continue to demand the end of fatal police maneuvers.”

In an interview with a local television station, KOCO 5 News, Mr. Scott’s mother, Vickey Scott, said the video showed that the police treated her son “like he was an animal.”

Derrick Ollie Scott Jr., Mr. Scott’s son, said he wanted the officers to be charged and convicted.

“My dad, he did not have to die,” he said.

The video showed officers confronting him in a parking lot. In the recording, Mr. Scott can be seen starting to run from the officers. A male officer tackles Mr. Scott, after which Mr. Scott can be heard gasping, “I can’t breathe,” and the officer replies, “I don’t care.” Mr. Scott repeatedly says, “OK” and “I can’t breathe” as officers handcuff him, one straddling his back, and then moving down to his leg.

Another officer holds her knee across Mr. Scott’s shoulders. After the officers restrain Mr. Scott’s hands, they roll him onto his side, into what Captain Withrow called a “recovery position” that would allow “for a better opportunity to breathe and relax while they maintain control of the suspect.”

After several minutes, an ambulance arrives. Mr. Scott can be heard crying and being told to “quit fighting.” As he is lifted toward a stretcher, he jumps up, kicks outward and then falls again. Later, in the ambulance, body cam footage shows one of the officers performing CPR.

Mr. Scott was then taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Captain Withrow said that investigations of Mr. Scott’s death conducted by the Police Department, district attorney’s office and medical examiner’s office showed there was “no indication of any wrongdoing.” He said the officers straddling Mr. Scott were conducting “academy taught” maneuvers.

He also said that “once they had any indication that there was any medical distress, they called for medical assistance immediately and began to monitor the subject.”

The district attorney for Oklahoma County, David Prater, could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday.

Asked about the officer who replied “I don’t care” to Mr. Scott, Captain Withrow said: “During the heat of a conflict like that, certainly that may be something an officer says, just understand the officers are fighting with someone at that point.”

He added, “It’s not uncommon for people when you’re struggling with them, when you’re trying to get them into control, to say, ‘I can’t breathe.’ You hear that frequently.”"
Texas Football Players Call on University to Drop a Song Steeped in Racist History,"For generations, students at the University of Texas at Austin have stood up at sports games, raised their right hand to form the symbol of the storied Texas Longhorns and belted out “The Eyes of Texas,” a campus anthem.

Now, athletes including members of the university’s football team, which holds an exalted place in the campus culture, want the song gone.

Unbeknown to many students and alumni, the song can be traced back to Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general, and was performed at minstrel shows in the early 20th century.

On Friday, student-athletes referred to that troubled history when they called on the university to replace it with a song “without racists undertones.”

It was among a long list of requests made by the athletes, who said that if their demands were not met, they would no longer help the university recruit new players or participate in donor events.

“We aim to hold the athletic department and university to a higher standard by not only asking them to keep their promise of condemning racism on our campus but to go beyond this,” the athletes wrote in a letter posted on Twitter by several players, including Brennan Eagles, a Longhorns wide receiver.

The department and university, they wrote, must take action “to make Texas more comfortable and inclusive for the black athletes and the black community that has so fervently supported this program.”

The song has become another symbol linked to the Confederacy to face intense scrutiny and demands for removal amid the nationwide protests after the death of George Floyd on May 25. The football team marched together in Austin this month, linking arms and taking a knee for eight minutes and 46 seconds, the amount of time a Minneapolis police officer kept his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck as he cried out that he could not breathe.

Nearly one week after Mr. Floyd’s death, Chris Del Conte, the university athletics director, encouraged athletes and staff members in a statement to “speak up and become a part of the direct and difficult conversations that must take place in the days and weeks ahead.”

“It is our duty to stand up against racism,” he added.

On Friday, Mr. Del Conte posted the athletes’ letter on his personal Twitter account and indicated that he would talk to the students about their demands.

“I am always willing to have meaningful conversations regarding any concerns our student-athletes have,” Mr. Del Conte said. “We will do the same in this situation and look forward to having those discussions.”

J.B. Bird, a spokesman for the university, said in an email that university officials were aware of the student-athletes’ list of requests.

He said university officials “look forward to working with them and the UT community to create the best possible experience on our campus for Black students.”

The athletes called on the athletics department and the university to take a series of measures including creating a permanent black athletic history exhibit in its Hall of Fame; donating a portion of the athletics department’s annual earnings to black organizations, including Black Lives Matter; and renaming campus buildings, including one honoring a mathematics professor who refused to let black students in his class after the university desegregated.

Lee’s connection to the song came through William Prather, president of the University of Texas from 1899 to 1905. In the 1860s, Prather had been a student at Washington College, in Lexington, Va., while Lee was the school’s president.

Lee would always end remarks to Washington faculty members and students by saying “the eyes of the South are upon you,” according to Edmund T. Gordon, a professor in the University of Texas’ African and African diaspora studies department.

Those remarks were most likely intended to remind students that the “tradition and the heritage of the South are watching over you and you should conform or engage in comportment that comes with that valiant tradition,” Professor Gordon said on Saturday.

That notion, of the antebellum South as a pastoral paradise filled with gallantry, is known as the “Lost Cause” ideology, which seeks to play down the evils of slavery and cast the Confederacy’s cause during the Civil War as just and heroic, he added.

When Mr. Prather became president of the University of Texas, he invoked the phrase and changed it to “the eyes of Texas are upon you,” Professor Gordon said.

Students wrote satirical lyrics with the phrase and set them to the tune of “I’ve Been Working on the Railroad.”

Its first performance was around 1903, by a university quartet at a minstrel show at the Hancock Opera House in Austin, the professor said.

“The assumption is it was performed in blackface,” he said.

The university acknowledges on its website that the song was “first sung at a minstrel show and taken indirectly from a Robert E. Lee quote, contextual elements that many people find offensive.”

“Embracing the song’s meaning today should not stop us from seeing its complicated past, and acknowledging the many ways that people see the song,” it added.

There has been resistance to the song before, Professor Gordon said. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, some student-athletes refused to stand when the song was played, but their efforts did not go far. In 2018, the student government held a debate over whether to stop singing the song.

“This is the first time that I know of that there has been relatively widespread support for having it not be the school song,” said Professor Gordon, who has been at the university for 30 years.

During a briefing with the news media on Thursday, Caden Sterns, a defensive back, said the recent protests around Mr. Floyd’s death and police brutality had created an obligation for students to educate themselves on the country’s history of racism.

“We’re more than just people out there just banging our heads and hitting people,” he said. “We’ve got people who got beliefs and perspectives, and so as athletes, I think we should use that to the fullest ability.”

On Friday, Mr. Sterns posted a message on Twitter, thanking people who have supported the team’s call for change.

“And for those who don’t.. and reacting with hate… still nothing but love,” he wrote. “True colors are being shown, and the hate will be EXPOSED.”"
Police Killings Prompt Reassessment of Laws Allowing Deadly Force,"ATLANTA — The swift decision on Sunday to fire the white Atlanta police officer who shot and killed a black motorist intensified the growing re-examination of the use of deadly force by the police, challenging longstanding principles that have given law enforcement officers wide latitude in cases in which an encounter ends with a death.

Although laws vary by state, police officers in America are generally allowed to use deadly force when they reasonably believe their lives or the lives of others are in danger, a legal standard designed to give the authorities enormous leeway to make split-second life-or-death decisions without hesitation or fear of prosecution.

But in the wake of years of growing anger over the deaths of African-Americans by the police, and particularly the nationwide upheaval following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month, those guiding principles are now falling away with astonishing rapidity, police and legal experts say.

“In the last two weeks, I have seen more legislators — federal and state legislators — talking about amending use of force laws, and I’ve seen more laws proposed than I’ve ever seen before,” said Seth Stoughton, a law professor at the University of South Carolina who studies policing and use-of-force policies. “There is a much broader bipartisan recognition that the status quo is untenable and something needs to change.”

Within 24 hours of the shooting death in Atlanta of Rayshard Brooks, which took place near a Wendy’s drive-through, the city’s police chief resigned and the officer who fired the fatal shot was terminated.

According to video captured by surveillance cameras and bystanders in the drive-through, Mr. Brooks struggled with two police officers before taking one of the officer’s Tasers. An officer then shot him as he fled. On Sunday, the Fulton County Medical Examiner’s Office ruled that Mr. Brooks’s death was a homicide and said he had been shot twice in the back, causing “organ injuries and blood loss.”

Also on Sunday, police released additional video showing that Mr. Brooks and the two officers spoke calmly for more than 25 minutes before the altercation.

As those details emerged, lawmakers and leaders drew parallels — and contrasts — with the other recent police-involved killings of black people that have ignited protests across the nation.

“We need reformation of how police officers do their jobs, how law enforcement does its job because what happened yesterday to Rayshard Brooks was a function of excessive force,” Stacey Abrams, the former Democratic candidate for Georgia governor in 2018, said on ABC’s “This Week.”

Over the last few years, a number of states have begun re-evaluating their use-of-force laws, particularly in the years since the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in August 2014, which stirred unrest there and set off a broader debate about race and law enforcement.

According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, at least 16 states enacted new laws regarding use of force from 2014 to 2017. One 2014 law in Utah restricted officers to “use only that force which is reasonable and necessary” for executing a warrant. And nine states in that time period changed the law to provide more transparency in investigations of deaths involving police.

Georgia law states that officers may use deadly force if they “reasonably believe” a felony suspect has a deadly weapon, poses an immediate threat of physical violence, or if they have probable cause to believe that the person has committed a crime that involves serious physical harm, or the threat of such harm.

For Gerald Griggs, a lawyer and first vice president of the Atlanta chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., the law tends to benefit the police. “If anything, the rules are bent toward law enforcement, and that’s a special interest,” Mr. Griggs said Sunday. “The police unions are the ones that are voicing support for that. And I think the community is beginning to see it’s the voice of a very small few that are driving this opposition to police reform.”

The shooting death of Mr. Brooks happened while the relationships among Atlanta politicians, rank-and-file officers and activists were already especially tense.

It took place less than three weeks after Mr. Floyd’s killing unleashed a torrent of protests across the nation against police brutality. Those protests included Atlanta, where demonstrations escalated into a violent confrontation in which crowds smashed through downtown businesses and set police vehicles on fire. In one fraught episode caught on video involving two African-American college students, police officers pulled a woman from a car and tased a man as he sat in the driver’s seat, leading to the termination of those officers, who also were charged with using excessive force.

On Saturday night, the city’s mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, said she did not believe that the shooting death of Mr. Brooks was “a justified use of deadly force,” and said the officer, Garrett Rolfe, should be terminated immediately.

The swift response, which also included the resignation of the city’s police chief, Erika Shields, reflected the intensified scrutiny now being applied to officers after using fatal force.

“I think people are fed up,” said Geoffrey P. Alpert, a professor of criminology at the University of South Carolina, adding that the shift has been fueled in large part by the prevalence of video evidence that often provides a clear account of officers’ using force beyond their word alone. “We’re starting to see a lot more evidence that is either going to allow the officers the justification to do what they did or condemn and sometimes convict them.”

Advocates for the police argue that officers are now being left to navigate a difficult landscape, believing they do not have the support of elected officials when responding to dangerous situations. “It doesn’t matter if we’re right or wrong,” said Vincent Champion, the southeast regional director for the International Brotherhood of Police Officers.

The shift in political winds since Mr. Floyd’s death in police custody has emboldened efforts at overhauling laws and policies surrounding policing that activists have pushed for years but found to be intractable.

In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed an expansive package of bills on Friday that barred the use of chokeholds and also repealed a statute in the civil code, known as 50-a, that shielded police officers’ disciplinary records from being released to the public.

Activists had targeted the code for years, particularly after Eric Garner died after a police officer in New York placed him in a chokehold in 2014, but their efforts had little success as they collided with powerful opposition, including from police unions.

In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom called for an immediate end to the use of “strangleholds” last week, saying such use of force had “no place any longer in 21st century practices and policing.”

In Washington, D.C., the City Council passed a new use of force provision last week in emergency legislation that will be valid for 90 days, but could eventually become permanent. It stipulates that a jury, in a criminal case against a police officer, must not only focus on whether the officer had a “belief” that the use of force was reasonable — a common standard in state law — but also find that an officer’s actions were reasonable.

This focus on “reasonable actions” is a seemingly small but potentially important shift in the goal posts in criminal use-of-force cases that was inspired by Cynthia Lee, a George Washington University law professor, who laid out the idea in a 2018 law review article.

The Washington law also requires juries to consider whether an officer engaged in de-escalation measures, and whether the officer’s preceding conduct increased the risk of a deadly confrontation.

“Even though law reform may not provide all the answers, it can help shift the culture,” Professor Lee said in an interview Sunday. “We want officers to be more careful when they’re in these tense situations and we want them to see people as human beings instead of enemies.”

In Atlanta, the police said they were called on Friday night to a Wendy’s where Mr. Brooks had fallen asleep inside his car while in the drive-through. Mr. Rolfe and another officer, Devin Brosnan, tried to take Mr. Brooks into custody after he failed a sobriety test, the police said.

Video filmed by witnesses shows Mr. Brooks wrestling with the officers, taking Officer Brosnan’s Taser and punching Mr. Rolfe, according to a New York Times visual investigation of the footage. Mr. Rolfe fired his Taser gun. The darts hit Mr. Brooks, and Mr. Rolfe continued trying to stun him. Mr. Brooks ran away, holding Officer Brosnan’s Taser gun. Mr. Rolfe gave chase, and continued to try to stun Mr. Brooks.

Mr. Rolfe fired his weapon three times at Mr. Brooks as he ran away. Mr. Brooks was taken to a hospital where he died, officials said.

Mr. Rolfe was fired over the shooting, officials said, and Officer Brosnan was placed on administrative duty.

transcript

On Friday night, June 12, an employee at a Wendy’s restaurant in South Atlanta calls 911. A 27-year-old man named Rayshard Brooks had fallen asleep in his car in the drive-through lane. Soon, two police officers respond. They and Mr. Brooks speak calmly and cordially for 41 minutes. “That was it.” But then in just 45 seconds, one of the officers fatally shoots Mr. Brooks as he is running away. [gunshots] How could a routine police response go so suddenly and horribly wrong? The Times examined witness videos, security footage, police body-cam and dash-cam videos. We synchronized and slowed down those videos so we can see and hear what unfolded. We reviewed police records, and procedures, and statements made by the officers involved. And we identified the critical moments and missteps that led to a young man losing his life. It’s 10:41 p.m., eight minutes after the 911 call when Officer Devin Brosnan arrives at Wendy’s. He raps on Brooks’s car window and wakes him up. Brooks appears groggy and disoriented. [beeping] Brosnan, who joined the Atlanta Police Department last year, talks to Brooks and then requests an officer who can perform sobriety tests. At 10:55 p.m., Officer Garrett Rolfe arrives. [beeping] Rolfe joined the Atlanta Police Force in 2013, and is an experienced D.U.I. investigator. Rolfe has once been reprimanded for firing his service weapon, police records show. He takes charge of the investigation. Rolfe begins to question Brooks, who is confused about where he is. He seems to think he’s six miles down the road near a Home Lodge Hotel. There’s another Wendy’s right beside it. At 11:02 p.m., Rolfe asks Brooks to get out of the car. Moments later, Brooks will also consent to a series of sobriety tests. Brooks is clearly inebriated. But he’s compliant and friendly throughout this time. The officers are courteous. And Rolfe gives him clear and precise instructions. When Rolfe now asks Brooks if he’ll take a breathalyzer test, Brooks hesitates at first. Brooks offers to go to his sister’s house. Why did Brooks want to resolve his situation without being arrested? According to court records, he was on probation for domestic violence and theft offenses. He was probably aware that a new arrest or conviction would almost certainly send him back to prison. The breathalyzer returns a blood alcohol reading of .108 percent, above the legal limit of .08 percent. Rolfe has little option now but to charge Brooks with D.U.I. Some policing experts told us he could have written a citation and drove Brooks home. Others said police are expected to show zero tolerance with drunken driving. For 41 minutes, Brooks and the officers have spoken calmly and respectfully. They even shared a few laughs. Now, Rolfe moves to arrest Brooks. And in 45 seconds, he will fatally shoot him. [gunshots] [yelling] Let’s watch this back, and break down what happens. Rolfe has signaled or sought Brooks’s consent for every action to this point. But he moves to handcuff Brooks swiftly and without clearly telling him he’s under arrest. This breaches D.U.I. arrest procedures. Brooks resists, and the three tumble to the ground. Brosnan draws his Taser … … and pushes it into Brooks’s leg. Brooks grabs the Taser. Both officers’ body cameras fall to the ground. Brooks stands up and strikes Rolfe with an open hand. As Rolfe draws his Taser, Brooks fires a dart, hitting Brosnan’s arm. Rolfe fires the Taser twice … [yelling] … and hits Brooks’s body. We hear Rolfe using his Taser as he chases Brooks. This is a breach of police procedures. Rolfe passes the Taser to his left hand and reaches for his gun. Brooks looks behind and fires the Taser he’s holding. We confirmed these Taser models with the Atlanta Police. Once they’re fired twice, they must be reloaded. So at this point, Brooks is unarmed. Rolfe drops his Taser, draws his handgun and fires three times at Brooks, who is 18 feet away and is trying to escape in a busy Wendy’s parking lot. [gunshots] Two bullets hit Brooks in the back, one piercing his heart. A third bullet hits this Chevrolet Trailblazer, which had three passengers in it. This photo from the Fulton County District Attorney shows the bullet hole. No one in the car was injured. Rolfe shouts at Brooks … ... and appears to kick him on the ground. This image, also provided by the Fulton County D.A., shows that moment more clearly. Officer Brosnan approaches and briefly stands on Brooks’s shoulder. [yelling] Meanwhile, witnesses denounce the shooting. The officers stand over Brooks for about a minute before Rolfe runs back to his vehicle to get his medical kit. Brosnan continues to stand by. It’s over two minutes before Brooks receives medical assistance. “Every fucking time!” Rolfe administers CPR until emergency services take over. At 11:39 p.m., 15 minutes after he’s shot, an ambulance takes Rayshard Brooks to a hospital where he is later announced dead. Was Rolfe justified in shooting a man holding a Taser, and who was trying to escape? Police procedures on the use of deadly force state that an officer must reasonably believe the suspect possesses a deadly weapon, and that the suspect poses an immediate threat of serious bodily injury to the officer or others. In a statement made through his lawyer, Officer Rolfe said he did use reasonable force because he “heard a sound like a gunshot” and fearing for his safety and the safety of others, he “fired” his weapon. The description of a gunshot doesn’t square with what Rolfe told investigating police at the scene. And minutes before this, Rolfe appears to have been aware that Brooks fired the Taser twice. This and other evidence will be scrutinized in what has now become a homicide investigation. Rolfe has been charged on 11 counts, including felony murder, and both officers with aggravated assault.

Under growing pressure from demonstrators outraged over the police killings of African-Americans, officials across the country announced major police reforms on Monday, further galvanizing a protest movement that has led to a nationwide reckoning over systemic racism. 

The New York police commissioner, Dermot F. Shea, announced he was disbanding the Police Department’s anti-crime unit, a team of hundreds of plainclothes officers that targeted violent crime and that was involved in some of the city’s most notorious police shootings.

The attorney general of California, Xavier Becerra, unveiled a series of recommended measures for police forces in the state, including banning chokeholds, requiring officers to intervene when colleagues use excessive force, and forbidding officers from firing shots at moving vehicles or from them, with rare exceptions.

In Albuquerque, political leaders said the city would take money from the budget of its scandal-plagued police force to create a new community safety department that would likely respond to calls related to homelessness, addiction and mental health.

And days after a black man was killed by a white Atlanta police officer, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms issued a series of executive orders aimed at overhauling how the Police Department uses force.

“It is clear we do not have another day, another minute, another hour,” Ms. Bottoms said of the orders, which came on the heels of the resignation of the city’s white police chief and the termination of the officer who fatally shot the man, Rayshard Brooks.

The announcements, some of which were unexpected or remarkable in their swiftness, followed weeks of protests and public unrest over police brutality after George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis.

Nationwide efforts to tighten the rules governing when and how police officers should use deadly force gained some momentum after the 2014 police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. But it is in recent weeks that significant policy changes have been adopted by state and city governments, while some protesters outraged by Mr. Floyd’s death continue to call for police departments to be defunded or abolished.

In New York, where the mayor and police officials have been under pressure from protesters to reduce the size of the Police Department, around 600 officers who served on teams that targeted violent crime and illegal guns will be immediately reassigned, Commissioner Shea said at a news conference.

“This is a seismic shift in the culture of how the N.Y.P.D. polices this great city,” he said.

The district attorney in Fulton County, Ga., has said he will make a decision by midweek on whether to file criminal charges in the fatal police shooting of Rayshard Brooks, 27, outside a Wendy’s restaurant on Friday night, the latest killing to stir outrage over a long history of deadly violence by the police against African-Americans.

The encounter outside the restaurant was captured on eyewitness videos, police body-camera footage and security camera footage. On Sunday, a spokesman for the Police Department said the officer who shot Mr. Brooks had been fired.

The police were called to the scene on Friday night because Mr. Brooks had fallen asleep in his car while in the restaurant’s drive-through line. Mr. Brooks was awakened and given a sobriety test, which he failed.

After two police officers had been on the scene for 27 minutes, much of that time talking with Mr. Brooks, one of the officers, Garrett Rolfe, attempted to handcuff him, leading to a struggle. The officers tried to stun Mr. Brooks with Tasers, and Mr. Brooks grabbed one of their Tasers and ran away, with Officer Rolfe in pursuit. Mr. Brooks turned at one point to fire the Taser back in Officer Rolfe’s direction; Officer Rolfe then pulled out his handgun and fired at Mr. Brooks three times as he was running away.

The Fulton County medical examiner’s office confirmed on Sunday that Mr. Brooks’s death was a homicide and that the cause of death was “gunshot wounds of the back.” The office’s statement said he had been hit by two shots in the back, causing “organ injuries and blood loss.”

The district attorney, Paul Howard, told CNN that the possible charges against Officer Rolfe included murder, felony murder and involuntary manslaughter. Mr. Howard said he would decide which, if any, charges to bring by midweek. (Felony murder refers to a homicide committed while committing another felony.)

“He did not seem to present any kind of threat to anyone,” Mr. Howard said of Mr. Brooks, “and so the fact that it would escalate to his death just seems unreasonable.”

“On June 12, one of our biggest fears became our reality. Not only did we lose another black, unarmed male, this time it landed on our front doorstep. Not only are we hurt, we are angry. When does this stop? We’re not only pleading for justice, we’re pleading for change.” “Rayshard Brooks, the name that may start a protest tomorrow or another day in the future. However, the man himself no longer has a future. He can no longer live in the present nor plan for tomorrow. How many more protests will it take — to ensure that the next victim isn’t your cousin, your brother, your uncle, your nephew, your friend or your companion — so that we can finally end the suffering of police excessive force?”

In an emotional news conference, the family of Rayshard Brooks, who was shot and killed on Friday by an Atlanta police officer, attempted to describe how the sense of loss and injustice that they had seen tear through other African-American families was now affecting their own.

“Not only did we lose another black, unarmed male,” said Chassidy Evans, a niece of Mr. Brooks. “This time, it landed on our doorstep.”

Ms. Evans said she had watched in disbelief three weeks ago as protesters swarmed downtown Atlanta, vandalizing buildings and setting a police vehicle on fire. At the time, she said, she had defended the Atlanta police, saying that while the anger of the demonstrators over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis was legitimate, the Atlanta police were not to blame. 

“This doesn’t happen here — leave them alone,” Ms. Evans recalled thinking, standing before a bank of cameras in a lawyer’s office to represent her family, including Mr. Brooks’s wife, his three young daughters, and cousins and other relatives. 

“Here we are, three weeks later,” she told reporters, “those same police took something away from my family we will never get back: Rayshard Brooks.”

The family said that they believed his death had been avoidable, and that their loss, like those of other families of people killed by the police, should be an impetus for systemic change. 

“My uncle did not die in vain,” Ms. Evans said. “His life mattered. George Floyd’s life mattered. Breonna Taylor’s life mattered. Michael Brown’s life mattered. Sandra Bland’s life mattered. I’m not only asking the city of Atlanta to stand with us. I’m asking for everyone in this nation to stand with us as we seek justice for Rayshard.” 

A 911 dispatcher watching surveillance camera footage of the arrest of George Floyd in real time became so concerned by what was unfolding that she called a supervisor with the Minneapolis Police Department to report it, according to new audio released by the city on Monday.

But that supervisor, who was not on the scene during the call, seemed to indicate that there was little reason for concern.

“I don’t know, you can call me a snitch if you want to, but we have the cameras up for 320’s call,” the dispatcher said on the audio recording, referring to the squad responding to the call at Cup Foods, the corner store where Mr. Floyd shopped before his fatal encounter with the police.

“I don’t know if they had to use force or not,” the dispatcher continued, adding that “all of them sat on this man. So I don’t know if they needed to or not, but they haven’t said anything to me yet.”

A white police officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into the neck of Mr. Floyd, who was African-American, for nearly nine minutes as Mr. Floyd cried, “I can’t breathe,” and later went limp. 

All four officers involved in the arrest were fired, and Mr. Chauvin has been charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, while the other officers have been accused of aiding and abetting in Mr. Floyd’s death.

In some instances, according to Minneapolis Police Department rules, officers must notify a supervisor when they use force, and the dispatcher appeared to be asking whether what she witnessed required notification.

“Yeah, if they haven’t said anything, this was just a takedown, which doesn’t count,” the supervisor told her, referring to the officers on the scene. “I’ll find out.”

“No problem,” the dispatcher said. “We don’t ever get to see it, so when we see it, we’re just like, ‘Well that looks a little different.’” 

Gunfire broke out during a protest Monday night in Albuquerque to demand the removal of a statue of Juan de Oñate, the despotic conquistador of New Mexico whose image has become the latest target in demonstrations across the country aimed at righting a history of racial injustice.

As dozens of people gathered around a statue of Oñate, New Mexico’s 16th-century colonial governor, shouting matches erupted over proposals to take it down and a man was shot, prompting police officers in riot gear to rush in.

The man, who was not identified, was taken away in an ambulance, and the police took into custody several members of a right-wing militia who were dressed in camouflage and carrying military-style rifles. It was not clear whether any of them had fired the shot, or whether they were merely being questioned.

The protest turned into pandemonium as protesters screamed and dove for cover and police officers attempted to secure the scene. Witnesses said the gunman was a white man in a blue shirt.

As protesters across the country have targeted a variety of symbols of racial injustice, including statues of Christopher Columbus, the protests in New Mexico are evolving to target symbols of colonial atrocities.

Earlier in the day, authorities in the northern town of Alcalde removed a different statue of Oñate, whose brutal rule as provincial governor put into motion centuries of Spanish rule in the region. 

President Trump said he would sign an executive order tomorrow that White House officials said would begin a process of encouraging police departments nationwide to adopt high standards for training and the use of force, among other practices.

“We’re going to have some solutions,” Mr. Trump said. “We need great people in our police departments, and we have mostly great people.”

Mr. Trump’s order will have no immediate practical impact, however. A senior administration official who briefed reporters in a conference call said the order would feature “guiding principles” that must be translated into more specific federal action by the executive branch and through potential congressional legislation.

The official said the order would call for the most modern standards for police training and the use of force; information sharing among police departments to track officers who have been the subject of complaints as they move between jobs; and encouraging programs that support police officers with social workers and other professionals on calls involving issues like mental health and homelessness.

A second official said the executive order would not condition federal dollars on any such actions but would use money to “incentivize” action by police departments.

The signing event will be attended by police officers and representatives, along with the families of people who have been killed by police officers, the first official said, adding that its goal is to “turn the anger in the country into action” and “bring some unification and healing.”

The official added that the executive order had been drawn up in consultation with law enforcement. “You’re never going to solve this problem by demonizing the police,” he added. 

A widely criticized legal doctrine that makes it hard to sue police officers for misconduct was left in place by the Supreme Court on Monday, when the justices declined to hear appeals in multiple cases on the issue. 

The doctrine, known as qualified immunity, has been attacked from across the political spectrum. Justice Clarence Thomas, probably the court’s most conservative member, has written that it was created out of thin air, while Justice Sonia Sotomayor, probably the most liberal of the justices, has written that it created an impenetrable legal barrier protecting the police from accountability. 

A federal civil rights law known as Section 1983 allows citizens to sue government officials, including police officers, over violations of constitutional rights. But in a series of decisions over decades, the Supreme Court has read limitations into the law, saying that officials are liable only if the right at issue was clearly established at the time of the conduct in question. 

And by “clearly established,” the court has meant something very narrow: There had to be a previous court decision involving nearly identical factual circumstances. That is an almost impossible hurdle to clear in most cases. 

A recent Reuters investigation found that the Supreme Court’s decisions on qualified immunity have made it increasingly difficult for plaintiffs to win cases accusing police officers of using excessive force.

Today, I’m announcing that my office will send Department of Justice investigators down to Palmdale, Calif., to engage in the investigation of the hanging death of Robert Fuller on June 10, 2020. We are doing all of this and much, much more. We have the experience. And we’re going to take these lessons to help build a better criminal justice system for all Californians. So starting with January of next year, a number of these reform measures are actually going to be required. We’re recommending that agencies move forward and adopt them as quickly as they can. And I’ve spoken to a number of leaders in law enforcement who say they’re contemplating the possibility of actually implementing before the Jan. 1 requirement deadline.

Officials in Palmdale, Calif., said in a news release late Monday that the Los Angeles County Coroner’s office has officially withdrawn its initial assessment that Robert L. Fuller, a black man who was found hanged from a tree near Palmdale City Hall last week, committed suicide. 

The city said that it “remains committed to a thorough and complete investigation” into the death of Mr. Fuller, 24, and that it was encouraged by the coroner’s change in assessment.

Earlier on Monday, officials in Los Angeles County said they were still investigating Mr. Fuller’s death despite the coroner’s original assessment, which relatives of Mr. Fuller had disputed. At a news conference, county officials said the investigation would involve toxicology tests, an analysis of Mr. Fuller’s cellphone, canvassing for video footage from the night of his death and other forensic efforts.

Alex Villanueva, the Los Angeles County sheriff, said the investigation would be monitored by the California attorney general’s office and the civil rights division of the F.B.I. “We’re taking all the necessary steps to make sure we’re fully transparent,” he said.

In an initial statement on Friday, the Sheriff’s Department said that “although the investigation is ongoing, it appears Mr. Fuller, tragically, committed suicide.” But at a rally for Mr. Fuller on Saturday, Diamond Alexander, his sister, said through tears that the initial conclusion about her brother’s death did not make sense.

“My brother was not suicidal,” Ms. Alexander said, according to a video of the rally in Palmdale. “He wasn’t.”

At the news conference on Monday, the authorities said that Mr. Fuller’s backpack and cellphone were found near where he died, but that there was no chair or stool. 

“The initial report appeared to be consistent with a suicide, but we felt it prudent to roll that back and to continue to look deeper,” Dr. Jonathan Lucas, the county’s chief medical examiner, said at the news conference.

Sheriff Villanueva said investigators would also speak with the authorities in Victorville, Calif., where the body of another black man, Malcolm Harsch, 38, was found hanged from a tree on May 31.

The men’s deaths have struck a chord with people in Southern California and across the United States. A petition demanding a thorough investigation into Mr. Fuller’s death had more than 247,000 signatures as of Monday afternoon.

[marchers chanting] Speaker: “— that has never worked for us!” Speaker: “Last Tuesday is a major issue. We know there’s issues with social —” “Black lives will matter in Georgia.” “That whether it [unclear] you in Minneapolis or Brunswick, Ga., or find yourself in Central Park or find yourself in Louisville, Ky., the fact that we’ve got to argue this morning that Black Lives Matter.” Speaker: “Throw somebody out of the White House!” Crowd: “Hands up! Don’t shoot! Hands up! Don’t shoot!” Speaker: “This is not a moment, this is a movement.”

An N.A.A.C.P. march that sent hundreds of people into the streets of downtown Atlanta on Monday was originally planned to focus on the collapse of Georgia’s statewide voting system last week, forcing some people to wait in lines for more than four hours to vote.

But then came Friday night, and the police shooting of Rayshard Brooks. That turned the march into a protest not only about impediments to voting, but also about the treatment of black people at the hands of the police. Signs in the crowd read “They steal elections,” “End voter suppression” and “Defund police.”

The twin themes were sounded repeatedly. Lloyd Pierce, head coach of the Atlanta Hawks, the city’s N.B.A. franchise, spoke at a morning rally about his pride in being black. Mr. Pierce said he would die a black man, “but I don’t want to die because I’m a black man.”

Wanda Mosley, of the advocacy group Black Voters Matter, accused the Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, of failing to act to fix known problems with Georgia’s new $107 million computerized voting system. “If you aren’t able to do your job, resign,” she said. 

The peaceful morning march to the State Capitol stood in contrast to the looting that broke out in some places over the weekend, most notably at the Wendy’s restaurant where Mr. Brooks was killed. The building was burned during protests on Saturday night. 

Through the weekend, other locations in Atlanta were tense as well, including a police station in Grant Park, a historic residential neighborhood south of downtown. Scores of police officers in riot gear flowed in to protect the station, and used tear gas to repel dozens of protesters on Saturday night.

When the marchers on Monday reached the Capitol, they made specific demands of legislators, including passage of a state hate-crimes law and repealing the state’s citizen’s arrest statute.

That statute was cited this year by a district attorney in Waycross, Ga., who told the police in nearby Glynn County that insufficient probable cause existed to arrest the three white men who pursued an unarmed black man, Ahmaud Arbery, through the streets of their neighborhood before killing him.

More than 50 progressive grass-roots groups have signed a letter to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., criticizing his response to the wave of protests over police brutality and criminal justice and saying his proposal to increase spending on a community policing program is “not the answer.”

Mr. Biden’s campaign platform calls for $300 million in additional money for the federal Community Oriented Policing Services program, which he helped create as a senator in 1994. He repeated that proposal as recently as last week. But in their letter, the organizations say Mr. Biden is wrong to push for more federal spending on police departments.

“The COPS program has directly contributed to the increased size and scope of policing in cities across the country, and the subsequent stream of violence and killings perpetrated by law enforcement on Black people in particular,” the letter says.

The groups signing the letter include the Center for Popular Democracy Action, the Working Families Party, the Sunrise Movement and Black Voters Matter.

The groups are asking Mr. Biden to embrace more sweeping proposals outlined by the Movement for Black Lives, like diverting money from police departments to programs that support education, housing and environmental justice. The groups framed their requests as an imperative for Mr. Biden to motivate black voters.

Strong backing from black primary voters propelled Mr. Biden to the Democratic presidential nomination this year, but general-election polling has shown Mr. Biden attracting less black support than Hillary Clinton did in the 2016 election.

“You cannot win the election without the enthusiastic support of Black voters,” the letter to Mr. Biden said. “How you act in this moment of crisis will play a big role in determining how Black voters — and all voters concerned with racial justice — respond to your candidacy. A ‘return to normalcy’ will not suffice.” 

In a sign of the rage over police killings that is boiling around the country, a nonlethal encounter early Monday morning between the police and a black teenager in St. Cloud, Minn., quickly stirred rumors of a fatal shooting as well as a heated protest.

The episode began shortly after midnight, according to the St. Cloud police, when two officers saw reports on social media about a person with a firearm outside a local business. The officers confronted the person, an 18-year-old black man.

He tried to flee, the police said, and in a struggle that followed, the man shot one of the officers in the hand. Both the officer and the man were taken to a hospital; the man had what the police chief, William Blair Anderson, described as minor injuries. 

Reports quickly spread on social media that the encounter had ended very differently, though — with the police shooting and killing a black teenager. Within hours, a crowd of about 100 people had gathered and was headed for the police station. 

Chief Anderson said at a news conference on Monday that the police understood that the crowd, acting on “misinformation, bad information or just flat-out lies,” intended to take over the station. He said officers used tear gas to disperse the group, but that several buildings, including the station, were damaged. Four people were arrested on minor charges, he said.

As the protest flared, officials raced to set the story straight, sending out a news release and calling community leaders to say there had been no killing. 

At the news conference on Monday, the mayor, Dave Kleis, said there had been a lot of “dangerous” misinformation on social media. He and Chief Anderson tried to turn the story into a positive one for the Police Department, arguing that the officers’ handling of the incident showed their restraint and professionalism.

“This is one of those situations that could have gone markedly different,” Chief Anderson said, suggesting that it was a case in which an officer could permissibly have used deadly force.

“You want to see what good policing looks like?” he said. “You want to see what community policing looks like? You want to see what community engagement looks like? Come to St. Cloud, and we’ll show you.”

The Kansas City police are investigating the vandalism of a historical marker about the lynching of a Missouri man, Levi Harrington, in 1882, a police spokesman said on Monday.

The blue and gold sign was removed from its signpost and tossed over a small wall and down a cliff, according to photos posted on social media and local news outlets. The police spokesman, Sgt. Jake Becchina, said that no one had reported the incident to the police, and that the investigation was begun after the department was alerted to the vandalism by news reports.

The sign was installed in 2018 by community leaders and the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit legal advocacy group, in West Terrace Park in Kansas City to memorialize Mr. Harrington.

The front of the marker explains how black residents were targeted after a police officer was fatally shot in the city on April 3, 1882. As Mr. Harrington traveled through the city that day, the police arrested him, even though they lacked evidence of any involvement by him in the shooting, the marker said. 

“An angry white mob quickly formed and grew to several hundred people intent on lynching Mr. Harrington,” it said. The mob hanged Mr. Harrington from a beam of a bridge and shot him. “Although newspapers reported that Mr. Harrington was innocent of the accusations against him, no one was held accountable,” the sign concludes.

The reverse side gives a capsule history of lynching in the United States. Researchers for the Equal Justice Initiative have documented more than 4,000 lynchings between 1877 and 1950.

“We are in no way deterred from our commitment to helping communities confront the history of racial injustice represented by lynchings of black people by white mobs,” the group said in a statement on Monday. “That symbols designed to promote understanding and repair are targets of vandalism and violence just reinforces the need for this project.”

The sign and others like it have been vandalized before. Someone defaced the Kansas City marker with graffiti in 2019, and a sign just outside of Glendora, Miss., placed in memory of Emmett Till, has been repeatedly struck by gunfire. 

Reporting was contributed by Julia Carmel, Jill Cowan, Michael Crowley, Shaila Dewan, John Eligon, Richard Fausset, Jacey Fortin, Astead W. Herndon, Dan Levin, Adam Liptak, Rick Rojas, Simon Romero, Kate Taylor, Ali Watkins, Will Wright and Alan Yuhas."
Tulsa Police Investigate Officer After Remarks About Race and Shootings,"The Police Department in Tulsa, Okla., said it was investigating one of its officers over remarks he made in a radio interview this week in which he spoke about police shootings of black Americans, amid nationwide protests against racism and ahead of President Trump’s visit next week.

The officer, Maj. Travis Yates, said in the interview that police officers were “shooting African-Americans about 24 percent less than we probably ought to be, based on the crimes being committed.”

In a telephone interview, Major Yates emphasized that he was “talking about the data” from others’ research. In a statement, he said, “To think that, beyond a discussion of comparative statistics, that I would suggest that the ‘police should actually be shooting’ anyone is simply outrageous.”

But his remarks were emphatically denounced by the mayor and the president of a black officers’ coalition. And the controversy brought the department under renewed scrutiny, as protests around the country have drawn attention to racial disparities in arrests and the use of force, and have called for greater police accountability. This week, the Tulsa police also announced an inquiry into the arrest of a black teenager who was accused of jaywalking and is shown in body camera footage being forced to the ground by officers.

“We do not endorse, condone or support Yates’ comments made on the show,” the Tulsa Police Department said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that its Internal Affairs Unit was investigating.

“We want to make it clear the statements made by Yates are not a part of any curriculum or training provided by the department,” it said. “Yates’ comments do not align with the mission, values or policies of the Tulsa Police.”

In a statement that day, Mayor G.T. Bynum said, “I want to believe he didn’t intend to say what he did, but what he did say goes against everything we are trying to achieve in community policing.”

“If he didn’t mean to make the statement in the way it has been received,” he added, “he owes Tulsans a clarification and an apology.”

Lt. Marcus Harper, the president of the Tulsa Black Officers Coalition, said the comments were disturbing and raised concerns about whether police officers conduct law enforcement differently in black neighborhoods.

Lieutenant Harper said in a news conference on Wednesday that the major had made “inflammatory” statements about police work and race before. In a 2016 essay, Major Yates wrote, “Follow the commands of a police officer or risk dying.” In 2018, he linked fatherless households with disparities in “police contacts,” saying they had “decimated African-Americans.”

“It seems like every so often, every time he opens his mouth, we are taking 10 steps forward and taking 100 steps back,” Lieutenant Harper said. “So now you have to ask yourself: Is he the voice of the Tulsa Police Department?”

In the radio interview on Monday, Major Yates, 48, was introduced as a private citizen who was not speaking for the Tulsa department. In his remarks about police shootings, he said he was citing research from the National Academy of Sciences; Dr. Roland G. Fryer, a Harvard economist; and Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research group.

Major Yates told the radio host Pat Campbell that there was a “meme” about black people being shot “two times, two and a half times more” than other people. “They’re not making sense,” he said. “You have to come into contact with law enforcement for that to occur.”

“If a certain group is committing more crimes, more violent crimes, and law enforcement’s having to come into more contact with them, then that number is going to be higher,” he said. “Who in the world in their right mind would think that our shootings should be right along the U.S. census lines?”

Major Yates said in his statement that news articles had misrepresented his “hypothetical discussion of statistics based on the research of others.”

In the telephone interview, Major Yates said he had been speaking in demographic terms. “Crime does not fall along the U.S. census,” he said. “There are a lot of social things that occur with it.” 

Asked whether he believed more black people are shot by the police than white people, he said: “You have to apply law enforcement with people you are coming in contact with. Are you going to look at population or crime? When you talk about demographic parity, that is very difficult.”

He said he had been quoting President Barack Obama in his remarks on fatherless households, and that he was willing to speak with anyone who disagreed with him.

The investigation into Major Yates was opened days after the police in Oklahoma City, responding to calls from Black Lives Matter, released video from the 2019 arrest of a black man who died in custody. It also comes as Tulsa — and its history of racist violence — falls under a national spotlight with the president’s visit. Mr. Trump’s rally is scheduled for June 19, or Juneteenth, the date that commemorates the end of slavery.

Mayor Bynum acknowledged the strains many Tulsans were feeling. “This is a moment in our city when every word you say can work to hurt or to heal,” he said. “Several of us are falling short.”"
Trump’s Actions Rattle the Military World: ‘I Can’t Support the Man’,"Erin Fangmann grew up in a military family, has been married to a captain in the Air Force for 18 years and has voted Republican all her life, including for Donald J. Trump. But as with a number of other veterans, troops and military family members who have watched the president with alarm, her support has evaporated.

“He has hurt the military,” said Ms. Fangmann, who lives in Arizona, one of several states in play this November with a high percentage of veterans and active-duty service members. “Bringing in active-duty members to the streets was a test to desensitize people to his future use of the military for his personal benefit. I think the silent majority among us is going to swing away.”

Since 2016, Mr. Trump has viewed veterans as a core slice of his base; in that year’s presidential election, about 60 percent voted for him, according to exit polls, and swing-state counties with especially high numbers of veterans helped him win. Many veterans and members of the military stuck with him even as he attacked the Vietnam War record of Senator John McCain, disparaged families of those killed in combat and denigrated generals whom he fired or drove from government service. Some conservative rank-and-file enlisted members silently agreed with Mr. Trump.

But the president’s threat last week to use active-duty troops on American streets against largely peaceful protesters, and his flirtation with invoking the 1807 Insurrection Act, have rattled the military world, from its top leaders to its youngest veterans. If they break in significant numbers, they could carry political weight in key battleground states like Arizona, North Carolina and Ohio.

“I have always been a swing voter,” said Amy Rutkowske, an Army veteran and spouse who lives in North Carolina and is volunteering on a House race, the first time she has ever volunteered in politics. “My fundamental understanding is that the president is the commander in chief and that the office demands respect. But I have never wanted a different commander in chief more.”

Some members of the military — who are not permitted to speak about politics publicly — and their families have been posting critically on social media about the president and policies of his that they once supported. Others, who have never been excited about Mr. Trump as their commander in chief, have begun to speak out, join protests and volunteer for progressive causes.

They say that Mr. Trump has politicized the armed forces — which pride themselves as being above politics and discourage partisan discourse in their ranks — and has threatened the Constitution, both of which they deem as last straws.

Of course, many veterans and military personnel still support Mr. Trump. Quality recent polling on their views is scant, but some have embraced his America-first campaign message, his focus on military spending and his creation of a new Space Force that has been unexpectedly well-received after initial scoffing.

In the 2018 congressional elections, when support for Democrats surged, 58 percent of military voters continued to vote for members of Mr. Trump’s party, according to exit polls. And those who do turn away from the president now will not automatically support his Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr.

Martin Sepulveda, a former commander in the United States Navy Reserve who lives in Arizona, said of Mr. Trump, “I can’t support the man.” But he added: “Am I a Biden guy? No. I don’t know what I will do. I have been a registered Republican for years.”

But the recent condemnations of Mr. Trump from high-level military veterans like Jim Mattis, the former defense secretary and a retired four-star Marine Corps general, have in some cases fortified the shifting views among military members. “The Mattis statement has changed people in some amazing ways,” said Chelsea Mark, a Marine veteran in Florida who works for a veteran service organization. “I went on a veteran hike recently, and I saw someone wearing a Donald Trump T-shirt, and that same person this week was posting anti-police-brutality things on her Instagram.”

On June 5, the same day the Marines issued a ban on displays of the Confederate battle flag at its installations, a retired Marine in dress uniform stood solo in front of the Utah State Capitol in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, with black duct tape across his mouth that read, “I can’t breathe.”

Mr. Trump’s moves to use the military against American protesters and looters came after several months of other highly unorthodox moves by his administration involving the military, including the clearing of three members of the armed services accused of war crimes; the firing of Capt. Brett E. Crozier after he raised alarms about the coronavirus on the aircraft carrier he commanded; the calling back of West Point students during a pandemic so the president could address them for a graduation, which he is set to do on Saturday; and the diversion of funds from military projects to pay for a border wall, a move that followed the deployment of troops to the border just before the 2018 midterm elections.

“This is the culmination of all those metronomic choices that have intruded into the military chain of command and culture,” said Kori N. Schake, the director of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, who served as a foreign policy adviser on Mr. McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign. “I do think it is likely to chip away among veterans, just as I believe it will chip away at support with Republicans more broadly.”

Mr. Trump’s ordering of the killing of a top Iranian general, which briefly appeared to bring the United States to the edge of war with Iran early this year, was a disappointment to the many veterans and service members who had supported him in part for his promise to end American involvement in overseas conflicts.

“The news of wanting to deploy the military domestically has caused a huge sense of outrage among most families I know,” said Sarah Streyder, the director of the Secure Families Initiative, which advocates diplomacy-first foreign policy and works on behalf of military families. “A lot of military families live on Facebook. Social media is very important for this transient community.”

Numerous military spouses concurred. “From what I see from my friends communicating online, spouses have grown much more vocal in opposition to policies,” said Kate Marsh Lord, a Democrat who is married to a member of the Air Force and lives in Virginia but votes in Ohio. “I have seen more spouses speak out on issues of race and lack of leadership than in my entire 15 years as a military spouse.”

Roughly 40 percent of active-duty service people and reserves are people of color, underlining how the current moment has affected military families.

“People took offense that they were using the military to calm peaceful protests by people of color who were out on the streets,” said Jerry Green, who served in the Army until 1998 and now lives in Tampa. “When I saw that whole thing unfold, for me, personally, it was awful. I was really distraught.” Mr. Green, who is black, will not be supporting Mr. Trump, whom he once found interesting, he said.

In North Carolina, Cal Cunningham, a Democrat and a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army Reserve who is challenging Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican, is working to capitalize on the military and veteran vote in his state, where Mr. Trump recently diverted millions of dollars for military installments to pay for a wall at the Mexican border after Congress blocked its funding.

“Cal’s profile as a military veteran is quite powerful in a state with so many veterans and military members,” said Rachel Petri, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cunningham. “Not only in communicating with them, but also with independent and swing voters who see the military and veterans as part of the state’s DNA.”

Other Democratic groups around the nation are also seeking leverage with the military vote. “We believe that Trump’s support within the military, with military families and with veterans, is soft and receding,” said Jon Soltz, a founder of VoteVets, which has been increasingly successful in electing Democratic veterans. “Our plan for the fall is simple: We’re putting together the most comprehensive data-driven veteran and military family get-out-the-vote operation the Democratic Party has ever seen, and we will deploy it to ensure Donald Trump is a one-term president.”

"Evoking History, Black Cowboys Take to the Streets","COMPTON, Calif. — Brianna Noble was impossible to miss when she first appeared among the throngs of protesters in the crowded streets of Oakland, Calif., at the end of May. Riding her horse Dapper Dan, with a Black Lives Matter sign draped on the horse’s right side, she drew gasps from the demonstrators surrounding her.

Ms. Noble founded a youth riding organization named Mulatto Meadows, which provides horseback riding lessons for young people of color. She is also the spark that has galvanized hundreds of other black cowboys and cowgirls around the country to join in the protests over the death of George Floyd and against police violence and racism.

A few days after Ms. Noble’s solo ride went viral, at least 30 black cowboys rode during a demonstration in Houston. They wore T-shirts with Mr. Floyd’s face on them. Most of them belong to the Nonstop Riders, an urban trail-riding club in Houston’s Third Ward.

And this past Sunday in Compton, Calif., a group of black men and women known as the Compton Cowboys led a peaceful protest through the streets with Mayor Aja Brown. As hundreds of people marched alongside, the cowboys rode with their fists raised in the air, yelling “No justice, no peace” as the music of Kendrick Lamar, also from Compton, blared in the background.

Randy Hook, one of the Compton Cowboys, saddled his horse that day for a larger cause, he said: “I could cry, and I never imagined anything like this. We’re making our family proud, our ‘hood proud, and our city proud.”

Keiara Wade, the only woman in the Compton Cowboys, expressed similar emotions.

“These horses feel whatever we feel, and they are hurting right now because we are hurting right now, too,” Ms. Wade said. “There is so much love and unity within the black cowboy and cowgirl community. We’re just trying to bring that energy to these marches in a peaceful way.”

The presence of black cowboys and cowgirls at the recent protests is a reclaiming of sorts of the traditional role of mounted riders in demonstrations in urban communities.

Historically, horses have been used by elite military units and law enforcement as a way to show authority, their visibility, height and commanding nature a symbol of power.

That black horse riders exist in these metropolitan cities, however, should not come as a surprise — one out of every four cowboys during the 19th century was of African-American descent.

Many of the black men and women who have appeared in the recent marches are the descendants of black people who fled the Jim Crow South after the Civil War in search of jobs and opportunities. Black men and women found work on ranches and farms and rode on cattle drives from Texas to California, where they became known for their daring and fearless riding styles.

Like the mounted demonstrators of today, the black cowboys of the past challenged the traditional idea of what a horse rider could look like. Some, like Nat Love and John Ware, were enshrined in the history books for their rodeo feats. But many more of their names have been forgotten.

The Compton Cowboys grew out of a group of 10 friends who came of age in the 1980s and 1990s — one of the city’s most violent and chaotic eras.

They learned about horses on Richland Farms, an agricultural community in the heart of Compton. Many of them have talked about what it means to be a black cowboy in one of the world’s most stigmatized communities, and how horses provide salvation from past trauma and safety from police violence.

Each member of the group describes interactions with the police differently. The horses, the cowboys say, are a form of armor against a Police Department that has been criticized for excessive violence since the 1980s.

“The world treats us way different when we’re on our horses,” said Anthony Harris, 38. “I feel safe and grateful that I have my horse at a time like now.”

The Cowboys’ motto, “Streets raised us, horses saved us,” has become a proud declaration. Riding horses, the cowboys say, also provides healing from trauma, anxiety, depression and other lingering effects from some of the violence they have experienced.

The Compton Cowboys, however, as this past week has shown, are far from an exception. Black cowboys and cowgirls exist in other major cities across the country. In Baltimore and Philadelphia, black horse riding communities are a staple in city folklore and identity. The Fletcher Street Urban Riding Club in Philadelphia is a century-old group that has been the subject of several documentaries. Oakland, Houston and Atlanta are also home to black urban horse riding communities.

The black cowboy and cowgirl communities share a similar code and creed. They are guided by a way of life that involves a supreme love for the animals they tend to and an appreciation for the ground they ride on.

But being a black cowboy also comes with its own challenges. At the end of the day, many said, facing discrimination in a primarily white rodeo circuit and combating societal stereotypes about African-Americans can be exhausting.

Before this week, black cowboys had made their way back into popular culture with the explosion of Lil Nas X’s song “Old Town Road” in 2018. They have also been helped by Texas-born artists like Megan Thee Stallion and Solange who promote cowboy and cowgirl culture.

But black cowboys have always been an integral part of the American experience. Through bouts of discrimination and structural inequities and now the death of Mr. Floyd — one thing has remained consistent: Black cowboys have never stopped riding.

"As Public Opinion Shifts on Racism, Trump Digs In","WASHINGTON — NASCAR is demanding that its fans no longer fly Confederate flags at races. The Pentagon and some Republican senators are open to renaming military bases that bear the names of Confederate soldiers. Corporate America is taking stances against racial injustice. A majority of Americans say the police show racial bias in their use of force, and a majority of self-described conservatives acknowledge protesters’ frustrations are at least somewhat justified.

Yet with public opinion shifting quickly on racism in America, and even some of the most cautious leaders and institutions talking openly about discrimination and reconciliation, there is still one glaring outlier: President Trump.

Whether it is suggesting shooting protesters or siccing dogs on them, pre-emptively defending the Confederate names of military installations or arguing that his supporters “love the black people,” Mr. Trump increasingly sounds like a cultural relic, detached from not just the left-leaning protesters in the streets but also the country’s political middle and even some Republican allies and his own military leaders.

While Mr. Trump has a long history of making insensitive and tone-deaf comments on race, including remarks widely seen as racist, he has never appeared more isolated on a dominant social and political moment in the country, hunkered down at the White House tweeting conspiracy theories about injured protesters and describing demonstrators as “THUGS.”

He regularly uses harsh and violent language that no other American leader employs, vocally supporting the views of white nationalists and even defenders of white supremacy rather than the views expressed by majorities of Americans in polls.

“He’s talking as if this is a country in the 1950s and not 2020,” said Levar Stoney, the mayor of Richmond, Va., where a multiracial group of protesters has prompted the city and state to take down Confederate statues.

At a time when the country is confronting three overlapping crises — the coronavirus, an economic collapse and a reckoning with racism and injustice — Mr. Trump’s inability to demonstrate empathy illustrates the limitations of his political arsenal. He is well equipped to compete in a campaign where slashing negative attacks are the order of the day, and few salesmen speak in superlatives like the former hotel magnate. Yet when the moment calls for neither pugilism nor promotion, he has little to say.

Reinforcing Mr. Trump’s instincts and decisions are a small group of advisers, like those who arranged for the president to hold a campaign rally on June 19 in Tulsa, Okla. — on a day dedicated to honoring black emancipation, Juneteenth, and in a city that saw one of the worst episodes of racial violence in the country’s history a century ago.

Even if that choice of timing was unintentional, it’s hard to overlook the insensitivity over race when the president’s campaign is selling “Baby Lives Matter” onesies on its website.

On Thursday, in remarks in Dallas, Mr. Trump tried to highlight how black unemployment had fallen before the coronavirus, and noted his administration’s work on criminal justice reform. But he also falsely suggested that the protest movement seeking to “defund the police” would lead to eliminating emergency phone lines.

“I heard they want to close up all police forces,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s not like they want to sort of bring a little money into something else. They want it actually closed. I’m thinking, what happens late at night when you make that call to 911 and there’s nobody there?” That remark drew some applause, yet the substance and tone emphasized fear-mongering at a time when many Americans are grappling with how to address police violence.

The president sounds even more out of step because of the comments of some of his Republican contemporaries, who have not focused on racial justice during the Black Lives Matter era.

“We are still wrestling with America’s original sin,” said Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, who has praised the peaceful protests taking place in, as he noted, his state’s cities and small towns while lamenting “the obvious racial discrimination that we’ve seen on full display on our television screens over the last two weeks.”

It is too soon to know whether Republicans like Mr. McConnell — or even large numbers of Americans — will support real action that curbs racial inequality. Mr. Trump’s allies and supporters have rallied around him, time and again. And recent polling shows that many Republicans continue to view some claims of racial discrimination with suspicion.

But this week, Democrats have introduced law enforcement overhaul legislation that goes far beyond what they have pushed before. And Mr. McConnell, recognizing the country is demanding action, tapped Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Senate Republican, to lead an effort on how to address police misconduct.

As the G.O.P. confronts an increasingly forbidding political climate this year, the party is responding to fast-moving polling, which indicates that an overwhelming number of independents and even about half of Republican voters believe George Floyd’s killing represents a broad problem with policing.

Yet nearly five years since Mr. Trump announced his presidential campaign with the inflammatory accusation that Mexico was sending rapist migrants across the border, he is still conducting himself as if there’s a vast audience for a hard-line tone on race. And it’s wearing on even some of his most steadfast allies.

“We need to have this president and both parties say, ‘We feel your pain,’” said Bishop Harry Jackson, a black pastor who is one of Mr. Trump’s evangelical advisers. “There needs to be a discussion to African-Americans and other minorities that the loss of life historically matters. Everybody’s got to feel that from him.”

Politically speaking, Mr. Trump has long sought to align himself with law enforcement and cultural traditionalists. But if he has the support of many of them, his hostility toward the protesters has left him out of sync with many other Americans at a time when his re-election prospects are sagging.

“When I saw some of those people breaking into stores, I said, ‘Damn, stop that,’” said former Gov. James B. Hunt of North Carolina, explaining that he was worried the looting would only prompt a moderate white backlash. “But that hasn’t become the story this time. People are seeing things differently today.”

Mr. Trump has never had most Americans’ trust on matters of race, helping to explain why he’s struggled to stem the tide of a protest movement demanding racial justice.

Mr. Trump has portrayed protesters as “terrorists” and extremists while praising most law enforcement officers as “great people.” Yet in a Monmouth University poll released last week, 57 percent of Americans — including a majority of white people — said the anger that led to the protests was completely justified. Even among self-described conservatives, 65 percent said the protesters’ frustrations were at least somewhat justified.

The data is even more striking among younger people. In a new Washington Post-Schar School survey, 41 percent of Republicans over 55 said they believed the killing of Mr. Floyd reflected a broader problem. That figure grew to 52 percent among Republicans under 55, however. There is a similar generational gap among independent voters.

Part of the difference owes to the experience of millennial Christians, who grew up in schools and churches that were integrated, enjoy a more diverse set of friends and are appalled by the police violence against black men they are seeing on their screens.

“Younger Republicans want to see racial disparities fixed,” said Wesley Donehue, a South Carolina-based G.O.P. strategist. “If Republicans don’t address these issues now, we will lose the next generation of young voters, just as we have minorities.”

What’s remarkable to a number of people across the political spectrum is that Mr. Trump seems to be missing what is all but screaming in neon — clear in everything from the diverse makeup of the protesters to the legions of people sending anti-racist books to the top of best seller lists.

“It wasn’t just black people,” DeJuana Thompson, an Alabama-based activist who just returned home from marching in Minneapolis and Louisville, said of her experience. “This is a clarifying moment for our country, and people are being asked to come out of our comfort zones.”

Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents Washington, D.C., in Congress and was active in the 1960s civil rights movement, said she had been struck by how many of the protesters in her hometown have been white.

“So many white people have taken this to heart,” Ms. Holmes Norton said.

Paul Finebaum, a popular college football talk show host, is detecting that every day on his ESPN call-in show. Mr. Finebaum has had a series of candid and at times awkward conversations about race with callers and coaches, black and white alike, in recent weeks.

“This is a watershed moment,” he said, remarking that the white people calling into his show were watching the protests “more open-mindedly than I’ve ever heard before.”

Yet on Wednesday, there was Mr. Trump, a native New Yorker, extolling the virtues of Southern heritage in making the case against changing the names of the military bases. His argument seemed even more jarring that night, when a 26-year-old black NASCAR driver, Bubba Wallace, wore a T-shirt that said “I Can’t Breathe” and drove a Chevy with “Black Lives Matter” emblazoned on the side around the Martinsville, Va., track.

Randall Woodfin, the mayor of Birmingham, Ala., is seeing changing attitudes in another conservative institution.

“C.E.O.s and leaders across corporate Birmingham are engaging their employees and saying, ‘Look, we can’t ignore this conversation, let’s make sure our values are not only in line, but let’s make sure we act on our values,’” Mr. Woodfin said.

Mr. Trump is often stilted in such discussions. And he has harbored offensive attitudes on race for years, including his searing attacks on the Central Park Five and his idea, on “The Apprentice,” for an all-white team competing against an all-black team.

As Mitch Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor, put it: “America is grabbing white people’s faces and saying, ‘Look at this, do not turn away’ — and they’re not.”

But the most powerful white person in America is averting his gaze, and it appears more discordant by the day.

"After Tragedy, Making a Place to Gather for Support and Solidarity","MINNEAPOLIS — Cup Foods, near the site of George Floyd’s fatal encounter with the police, is an unassuming store across from a Speedway gas station and Dragon Wok.

The memorial to Mr. Floyd at the site is ever expanding. Almost everyone who visits it stops and poses for a selfie. The gathered crowd is a cross section of race and class. Ranay Barton, 18, has been out since the night of Mr. Floyd’s death.

“I came out here because I was angry,” she said. “The first thing that ran through my mind was to be mad at white people. When things like this happen, you tend to segregate yourself. But seeing all the support and solidarity calmed me down. All these people are different colors, from different places, coming together for a purpose. I feel like the world should be like that.”

It has become a place to gather and reflect about race.

“We need white people to stand up,” said Lux Thunberg, who, like most people in the neighborhood where she grew up, is black. “We need white people who are not comfortable with racism to talk to those who are.”

Ms. Barton worried about whether there would be sustained change. “If his death doesn’t do anything, the world will fall apart,” she said. “People are fed up. When people are angry, they are unpredictable. Most of the time, nothing happens to the killers. You should never lose your life over a petty crime.”

Buses, cars and discarded shipping pallets were used to block entry to the memorial. A long list of the names of black people killed by the police was chalked into the middle of the road. Businesses nearby have started to reopen. D.J.s set up, and as the sun sets and the day cools, the parking lot of the Speedway gas station across the street turns into a raucous dance party.

But even as the mood has lifted in recent days, the significance and heaviness of the place still dominates.

Ms. Barton leaned back on a couch set up under the Speedway gas sign, in an area now known as “George Floyd Square,” and sighed.

“Whenever I see an innocent black man get killed, I see my brother. That could be me,” she said. “I’m tired. We shouldn’t be facing this in 2020.”"
"From Cosmetics to NASCAR, Calls for Racial Justice Are Spreading","The reckonings have been swift and dizzying.

On Monday, it was the dictionary, with Merriam-Webster saying it was revising its entry on racism to illustrate the ways in which it “can be systemic.”

On Tuesday, the University of Washington removed the coach of its dance team after the only two black members of the group were cut. The two women were invited to return.

On Wednesday, after a black racecar driver called on NASCAR to ban the Confederate battle flag from its events, the organization did just that.

On Thursday, Nike joined a wave of American companies that have made Juneteenth, which celebrates the end of slavery in America, an official paid holiday, “to better commemorate and celebrate Black history and culture.”

And on Friday, ABC Entertainment named the franchise’s first black man to star in “The Bachelor” in the show’s 18-year history, acceding to longstanding demands from fans.

In just under three weeks since the killing of George Floyd set off widespread protests, what started as a renewed demand for police reform has now roiled seemingly every sphere of American life, prompting institutions and individuals around the country to confront enduring forms of racial discrimination.

Many black Americans have been inundated with testaments and queries from white friends about fighting racism. And anti-racist activists have watched with some amazement as powerful white leaders and corporations acknowledge concepts like “structural racism’’ and pledge to make sweeping changes in personal and institutional behavior.

But those who have been in the trenches for decades fighting racism in America wonder how lasting the soul searching will be.

The flood of corporate statements denouncing racism “feels like a series of mea culpas written by the press folks and run by the top black folks” inside each organization, said Dream Hampton, a writer and filmmaker. “Show us a picture of your C-suite, who is on your board. Then we can have a conversation about diversity, equity and inclusion.”

“Stop sending positive vibes,’’ begged Chad Sanders, a writer, in a recent New York Times Op-Ed, directing his white friends to instead help protect black protesters, donate to black politicians and funds fighting racial injustice, and urge others to do the same.

The protests have so far yielded some tangible changes in policing itself. On Friday, New York banned the use of chokeholds by law enforcement and repealed a law that kept police disciplinary records secret.

But their power is also cultural. A run on books about racism has reordered best-seller lists, driving titles like “How to Be an Antiracist’’ and “White Fragility’’ to the top. And language about American racial dynamics that was once the purview of academia and activism appears to have gone mainstream.

In a video released June 5 apologizing for the N.F.L.’s previous failure to support players who protested police violence, Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the league, condemned the “systematic oppression” of black people, a term used to convey that racism is embedded in the policies of public and private institutions. The Denver Board of Education, in voting to end its contract with the city police department for school resource officers, cited a desire to avoid the “perpetuation of the school-to-prison pipeline,” a reference to how school policies can lay the groundwork for the incarceration of young black Americans.

“One of the exhilarating things about this moment is that black people are articulating to the world that this isn’t just an issue of the state literally killing us, it’s also about psychic death,’’ said Jeremy O. Harris, a playwright whose “Slave Play” addresses the failure of white liberals to admit their complicity in America’s ongoing racial inequities.

He added, “It’s exhilarating because for the first time, in a macro sense, people are saying names and showing up and showing receipts.’’

Sensing a rare, and perhaps fleeting, opportunity to be heard, many black Americans are sharing painful stories on social media about racism and mistreatment in the workplace, accounts that some said they were too scared to disclose before. They are using hashtags like #BlackInTheIvory or #WeSeeYouWAT, referring to bias in academia and “White American Theater.”

The feeling of a dam breaking has drawn analogies to the fall and winter of 2017, when sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein triggered a deluge of disturbing accounts from women and provoked frank conversations in which friends, colleagues and neighbors confessed to one another: I’ve suffered in that manner as well. Or: I now realize I have wronged someone, and I’d like to do better.

Though racism is hardly a secret, “a huge awakening is just the awareness of people who don’t face the headwinds,” said Drew Dixon, a music producer, activist and subject of the documentary “On the Record,” about her decision to come forward with rape allegations against the music producer Russell Simmons, which he has denied. “Many people had no idea what women deal with every single day, and I think many non-black people had no idea what black people deal with every day.”

While the outpouring may seem sudden, there have been signs that perceptions on race were already in flux.

Opinion polls over the last decade have shown a self-reported turn by Democrats toward a more sympathetic view of black Americans, with more attributing disparities in areas like income and education to discrimination rather than personal failure. By 2018, white liberals said they felt more positively about blacks, Latinos and Asians than they did about whites.

The reason for the shift is unclear — and those attitudes have so far not translated into desegregated schools or neighborhoods — but may help explain the cascade of responses to Mr. Floyd’s killing.

The outpouring is also related to the horrific nature of Mr. Floyd’s death — a white police officer kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes — captured in a stark video at a moment of rising national frustration with the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdown.

The protests still surging through the streets of America’s cities, said the civil rights movement scholar Aldon Morris, are “unprecedented in terms of the high levels of white participation in a movement targeting black oppression and grievances.”

Younger Americans are also much more racially diverse than earlier generations. They tend to have different views on race. And their imprint on society is only growing.

Brands trying to appeal to younger consumers have in recent years increasingly proclaimed their belief in equality and justice. Two years ago, Nike featured in a major ad campaign the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who knelt during the national anthem to protest racism. The tagline for MAC, the cosmetics company, is “All Ages, All Races, All Genders.”

In the wake of the Floyd protests, everyone from Wall Street C.E.O.s and the sportswear giant Adidas to the fruit snack Gushers and a company that sells stun guns put out statements of support of diversity, flooding Instagram with vague messages.

These prompted cries of hypocrisy from those who said the companies don’t practice the values they’re espousing.

At several companies, what employees saw as an inadequate response to Mr. Floyd’s death seemed to serve as a catalyst for a long-simmering contention over questions of racial equity. At Adidas, dozens of employees stopped working to attend daily protests outside the company’s North American headquarters in Portland, Ore.

The tumult has been especially fraught at Estée Lauder, the beauty giant, stemming from the political donations of Ronald S. Lauder, a 76-year-old board member and a son of the company’s founders. He has also been a prominent supporter of President Trump.

On May 29, employees at Estée Lauder, like those in much of the rest of corporate America, began receiving emails from the company’s leadership addressing racial discrimination.

There was “considerable pain” in black communities, one missive noted. According to copies of the internal communications obtained by The New York Times, the company, whose vast portfolio includes Clinique, MAC, Bobbi Brown, La Mer and Aveda, encouraged employees to pause working on June 2 in honor of “Blackout Tuesday.”

At a video meeting on June 4 among an internal group called NOBLE, or Network of Black Leaders and Executives, company leaders said Estée Lauder was donating $1 million to support racial and social justice organizations. But employees pinpointed Mr. Lauder’s political donations to Mr. Trump as being in conflict with the company’s stance on race. The president has tweeted conspiracy theories about injured protesters, described demonstrators as “THUGS,” and praised most law enforcement officers as “great people.”

Employees left dissatisfied. Later that night, a petition appeared on Change.org.

The company’s donation did “not match, or exceed Ronald Lauder’s personal donations in support of state-sanctioned violence,” organizers of the petition, which has amassed more than 6,000 signatures, wrote. “Ronald Lauder’s involvement with the Estée Lauder Companies is damaging to our corporate values, our relationship with the Black community, our relationship with this company’s Black employees, and this company’s legacy.”

In his first public comment on the situation, Mr. Lauder told The Times in a statement Friday that he had spent decades “fighting anti-Semitism, hate and bigotry in all its forms in New York and around the world as president of the World Jewish Congress.”

“As a country, we must recommit ourselves to the fight against anti-Semitism and racism,” he said. “In this urgent moment of change, I am expanding the scope of my anti-Semitism campaign to include causes for racial justice, especially in the Black community, as well as other forms of dangerous ethnic and religious intolerance around the world.”

On Monday, Estée Lauder said it would donate $5 million in coming weeks to “support racial and social justice and to continue to support greater access to education,” and donate an additional $5 million over the following two years.

Other companies have also pledged money. On Thursday alone, PayPal, Apple and YouTube collectively pledged $730 million to racial justice and equity efforts.

As companies face restive employees, pressure has also grown to remove those who have made offensive statements. Others have had to apologize publicly. Adam Rapoport resigned as editor in chief of the magazine Bon Appétit on Monday after a 2004 photo showing him in an offensive costume resurfaced on social media.

And Greg Glassman, the founder and chief executive of CrossFit, stepped down on Tuesday following comments about race and racism on a Zoom call to gym owners.

“We’re not mourning for George Floyd, I don’t think me or any of my staff are,” said Mr. Glassman on the Zoom call, according to a recording of the call provided to The Times.

“Can you tell me why I should mourn for him?” he said. “Other than it’s the ‘white’ thing to do. I get that pressure, but give me another reason.”

NBCUniversal, a division of Comcast that includes the NBC broadcast network and cable channels like Bravo, has encountered fires on multiple fronts as the reckoning has swept the country.

For NBC, the problems started the morning after Mr. Floyd’s death, when Jimmy Fallon found himself under attack on Twitter for performing in blackface on “Saturday Night Live” in 2000. A video of the sketch had resurfaced online. Mr. Fallon, who has been an NBC star for 22 years, first at “SNL” and more recently leading the “Tonight” show, issued a written apology that afternoon. He apologized at length on camera the following week.

On June 2, a writer was fired from an upcoming NBC series, “Law & Order: Organized Crime,” after posting photos of himself on Facebook holding a weapon and threatening to “light up” looters.

Then came an explosion from NBCUniversal’s cable division. The hit reality series “Vanderpump Rules,” an anchor tenant on Bravo since 2013, fired four cast members for past racist behavior. Some of the incidents were already known. Others were disclosed on Instagram after Mr. Floyd’s death.

On June 8, Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive, said in a memo to employees that the company would give $75 million to social justice organizations, along with $25 million worth of advertising inventory, including on Sky, its pay-television unit in Britain.

“We know that Comcast alone can’t remedy this complex issue,” Mr. Roberts wrote. “But you have my commitment that our company will try to play an integral role in driving lasting reform.”

Late last Saturday night, two women who study black health and communication were talking to each other, for what seemed like the thousandth time, about the racism they have encountered in their careers.

The killings of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and too many others had brought them to a “boiling point,” recalled one of the women, Joy Melody Woods, a graduate student at Moody College of Communication. But the national conversation was still focused primarily on police brutality.

“That’s not the only system that perpetuates white supremacy,” Ms. Woods said. “There are other systems, and academia is one of those.”

Ms. Woods called on black scholars to begin sharing their experiences using the hashtag #BlackInTheIvory, which her friend Shardé M. Davis, an assistant professor at the University of Connecticut, had just coined.

The women went to sleep that night, not knowing they had opened the floodgates. The hashtag was trending by Sunday night, and as of Thursday evening had collected nearly 90,000 tweets.

The stories of exclusion, humiliation and hostility were all too familiar. But the difference was that they had mostly been shared behind closed doors. In the past, nonblack colleagues could be sympathetic but were more often dismissive or worse, sometimes labeling a black colleague as “difficult.”

“What feels different this time is that white folks are listening,” Dr. Davis said.

Particularly important, she and others said, is that white scholars seem to be having conversations about racism in their institutions without a black colleague around to prompt or guide them.

“You need to be willing to get in the mix and have the conversation and not expect us to hold your hand through the whole thing — and so maybe that’s something that is beginning to gain momentum,” said Chanda Prescod-Weinstein, a theoretical physicist and feminist scholar at the University of New Hampshire.

There’s a tendency among nonblack scholars to view their black colleagues as exempt from police brutality and violent hate crimes. But, Dr. Prescod-Weinstein said, “That sense of safety isn’t real — our Ph.D.s are not bulletproof.”

The danger is particularly acute for black naturalists, as shown in the recent incident with Christian Cooper, the birder in Central Park who asked a white woman to leash her dog, only to have her call 911.

“Our job means going into the field and being visible and moving in spaces that are not always welcoming to us,” said Earyn McGee, a herpetologist and birder at the University of Arizona. “We understood what the danger was.”

The viral video prompted Ms. McGee and others to organize #BlackBirdersWeek. Jeffrey Ward, a co-organizer and well-known birder, said he always keeps his binoculars visible to reassure people who act fearful when they see him. After two police officers followed and questioned him two years ago at Crotona Park in the Bronx, he recalled, he told some white friends. They were sympathetic then, but seem to better grasp the breadth and gravity of systemic racism now, he said.

“They reached out to me and said, ‘We didn’t understand it was this serious. We apologize for not listening to you before.’”

Dr. Prescod-Weinstein was one of several researchers who called for a strike on Wednesday to protest racism in science. Nearly 6,000 scientists, professional societies and institutions pledged to join. 

But she also noted that academic institutions are unrelentingly hierarchical and resistant to change.

As a postdoctoral fellow at M.I.T., Dr. Prescod-Weinstein was the only black physicist with a Ph.D. in a department of about 100. Students of color sought her out for advice and mentoring, she said — unpaid labor that she was never recognized or compensated for — and they felt the pressure of having to represent their entire race.

“That kind of pressure is extraordinary,” she said.

Inequity in universities manifests at multiple levels. Black academics are disproportionately hired to positions with weaker long-term prospects. They receive fewer grants, and their papers are cited less often.

Changing these systems will take “an incredible amount of energy at the right pressure points in the system,” said Dr. Kafui Dzirasa, a psychiatrist at Duke University.

For any system — say, applying for grants from the National Institutes of Health — making things more equitable would come at a cost, either to the system or to nonblack applicants. “And that’s the cost that it’s unclear if the system is ready to take on,” Dr. Dzirasa said.

Dr. Davis was more blunt.

“We’ve received nothing but empty platitudes and empty promises, and the wound just scabs right back up,” she said. “We’re walking around in institutions with a whole bunch of Band-Aids and scabbed-over wounds. Enough, enough.”

"Rage and Promises Followed Ferguson, but Little Changed","America has been here before: a black man on the asphalt dying at the hands of the police. Convulsive protests across the country. A national reckoning. Vows to change.

The last time was August 2014. Michael Brown was the victim. Darren Wilson was the officer. Ferguson, Mo., was the place.

After the unrest that followed that fatal shooting, police departments spent tens of millions of dollars on body cameras, revised use-of-force policies and held training sessions in implicit bias and de-escalation. A presidential task force issued 153 recommendations and action items. The Justice Department forced seven troubled police departments into consent decrees with mandatory benchmarks aimed at reducing racial disparities and police brutality.

Six years after Mr. Brown’s body was left on the street for hours, the death of another African-American man, George Floyd, who begged for his life as a Minneapolis officer pressed a knee on his neck, came down like a verdict: The plan to remake American policing has failed.

The Minneapolis Police Department had itself been a beneficiary of that plan, as a pilot site for a federal program to increase trust in the criminal justice system. It had a measurable impact, said David Kennedy, a policing expert who worked on the project, but “it absolutely, obviously, transparently wasn’t enough.”

Attitudes have changed, yes. Police critics have been elected to positions of power. Some departments have decreased arrests, rethought stop-and-frisk policies and reduced police shootings. There have been successful experiments with diverting people to social services instead of jail.

But topline numbers, such as the overall count of people fatally shot by the police each year, have not budged. And even when departments pull back from aggressive policing, they often find that stark racial disparities linger — or worsen.

A federal after-action report found that the Ferguson police had escalated the tensions there by failing to understand the community’s problems and using “ineffective and inappropriate tactics” like the use of tear gas in unsafe conditions and without warning — tactics that now appear to have proliferated across the country.

Despite the renewed urgency every time a black man or woman dies needlessly at the hands of law enforcement, activists have found that the pace of change ranges from slow to glacial.

“We’ve had so many working groups. We’ve had so many recommendations,” said Valerie Castile, the mother of Philando Castile, who was fatally shot during a traffic stop in a Minneapolis suburb two years after the protests in Ferguson. During an online panel hosted by the Institute for Innovation in Prosecution, she added, “I’ve sat and talked for four years, but here I find myself again. The same situation. And I think we’ve covered everything you could possibly imagine about what we should do and what we could do, but nothing is being implemented.”

The cycle of good intentions and valiant efforts resulting in marginal improvements has led to calls in recent days to cut funding for police departments or abolish them altogether. But it also leaves open the question of whether the renewed calls for reform after Mr. Floyd’s death will lead to lasting change.

Even attempts to quantify the problems have come up short. An F.B.I. database tracking the use of force by the police in cases like that of Mr. Brown will be made public for the first time this summer. And though it has taken five years to put in place, the tracker includes only 40 percent of the nation’s police officers.

A bill introduced this past week by congressional Democrats would require law enforcement agencies to report use-of-force data. An accounting of deaths in police custody, like that of Mr. Floyd, was mandated by Congress after Mr. Brown died, but it is behind schedule.

Despite widespread support, there are still no national standards for police recruitment, training or use of force.

But there are reports on top of reports and reforms on top of reforms. The Minneapolis Police Department agreed in recent days to ban chokeholds and require officers to intervene when they see misconduct. But the department had already established a duty to intervene in the years after the shooting in Ferguson.

Even before the recent deaths of Ahmaud Arbery near Brunswick, Ga.; Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Ky.; and Mr. Floyd, experts who have been involved in reshaping police departments were under no illusions that they had made enough progress. Police leaders who aim to make reforms have been stymied by significant obstacles like state laws, union opposition and contractual protections for officers accused of misconduct.

Experts say that federal leadership in efforts to improve policing under former President Barack Obama evaporated under President Trump.

Amid concerns about police militarization, the Obama administration reined in a program that gave surplus equipment, including grenade launchers and armored vehicles, to police departments, but Mr. Trump lifted those restrictions.

The Obama administration embraced the use of consent decrees — mandatory, measurable plans overseen by independent monitors — to clean up troubled departments, a tool put in place after the videotaped beating of Rodney King in 1991.

Christy E. Lopez, a former Justice Department official who led police department investigations during the Obama administration, said experience had shown that in many cases nothing short of a consent decree could overcome obstacles like entrenched racism and union opposition.

Even though only a tiny percentage of the nation’s 18,000 police departments ever came under a consent decree, they set a tone, established best practices and put police leaders on notice that they, too, could come under scrutiny if they showed a “pattern and practice” of civil rights violations.

“There is something irreplaceable about the leadership of the federal government and the Department of Justice,” Ms. Lopez said.

The Trump administration ended the use of consent decrees and significantly curtailed a popular voluntary program, the collaborative reform initiative, which helped departments accomplish goals like reducing officer shootings.

Attorney General William P. Barr has famously attributed police abuses to “bad apples” and said that criticism of the police was emboldening those who disrespect the law. “I don’t think that the law enforcement system is systemically racist,” he said last Sunday in a television interview.

The move away from consent decrees began after a damning Justice Department report on the Chicago police in 2017 that had been expected to result in aggressive federal oversight. When the Illinois attorney general, Lisa Madigan, stepped in to place the department under a state consent decree instead, Jeff Sessions, then Mr. Trump’s attorney general, unsuccessfully opposed the move in federal court, despite having said that police oversight should be a state and local responsibility.

Last month, Seattle requested that it be released from the consent decree it has been under since 2012, describing itself as a reformed agency. But it reversed course after the Floyd demonstrations began and after the city received thousands of complaints about the actions of its officers.

Consent decrees have often been frustratingly slow to carry out, with even minor changes like requiring officers to give people business cards meeting with opposition. 

Still, in places like Chicago, they have had tangible results. Use-of-force incidents in the city declined between 2015 and 2019, and shootings decreased by almost half. But the proportion of subjects of force who are African-American has stayed above 70 percent, while the city’s population is 30 percent African-American.

San Francisco participated in a similar but voluntary reform program that is overseen by the California Department of Justice. Use-of-force episodes there decreased by nearly half between the first quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of this year, and the percentage of subjects of force who were black fell to 37 from 47.

Experts say the demographic makeup of the general population is not a good benchmark because most people do not interact with the police. One study of fatal police shootings that took criminal activity into account found no overall racial disparity, but said that black victims were more likely to be unarmed and pose no immediate threat, while white victims were far more likely to have provoked the police to harm them, commonly referred to as “suicide by cop.”

Traffic stops are another way to measure department performance that is not driven by calls for service. Four years after a New York Times investigation found that the police in Greensboro, N.C., were disproportionately pulling over black motorists, the percentage had barely changed, though the total number of stops declined, according to the Open Data Policing project. The department was more than four times more likely to search a black driver than a white driver in 2019 — a greater disparity than four years before. In both groups the police reported finding contraband a third of the time.

Minneapolis itself is a study in how slow change can be even when leaders want it. The city, known for excessive uses of force against African-Americans, had hired two successive police chiefs hailed as reformers. The department had given officers training in implicit bias, reconciliation and “procedural justice,” which focuses on how officers treat the public. The city had overhauled its disciplinary system and invited a federal review of its Early Intervention System, which is supposed to flag officers who need coaching or more.

Unlike in Ferguson, the officers involved in Mr. Floyd’s death were quickly identified and fired, and then criminally charged. But that did not stop days of protest and vows by City Council members to dismantle the existing department entirely.

Unions have worked particularly hard at limiting the consequences for officers who use force. Kathy Mitchell, a police reform advocate in Austin, Texas, said that in recent years groups have sought to emphasize de-escalation and moved to narrow the standard under which officers can use deadly force.

But the union fought the effort because officials believed it would put officer lives at risk, said Ken Casaday, the president of the Austin Police Association.

The result, Ms. Mitchell said, was mixed messages in the policies on de-escalation and use of force.

“With every gain that we’ve made, it has been followed by a period of grinding those gains down through a thousand cuts,” she said.

Members of civilian review boards meant to subject the police to community oversight perennially complain that they are toothless.

In Seattle, Lisa Daugaard, a former chair of the city’s Community Police Commission, said the panel recommended that the police suspend the use of flash-bang grenades to disperse protesters until they could be reviewed. But the department continued to use them extensively, with the police chief saying she would prefer not to, but that officers should have that tool available.

“We are used to 100 percent of our recommendations being ignored,” Ms. Daugaard said.

In St. Paul, Minn., Constance Tuck said she quit her post last year as the chairwoman of the city’s Police Civilian Internal Affairs Review Commission after finding that the city was gutting the power of the panel. The mayor’s office said it still saw the commission as a vital tool.

In recent days, there has been growing pressure to blunt the power of unions or force them to change. A group of current and former prosecutors called on the State Bar of California to change its ethics rules to prohibit prosecutors — or those campaigning for the job — from seeking or accepting political donations from law enforcement unions.

In Seattle, the King County Labor Council that brings together local unions to advocate as a unit passed a resolution this month saying that the Seattle Police Officers Guild could be kicked out of the group unless it was willing to acknowledge that racism was a structural problem in law enforcement and committed to ensuring that union contracts “do not evade legitimate accountability.”

But many of the protesters have lost patience with incremental changes. Calls to abolish or defund the police, once a radical solution, have recently been amplified and taken up by elected officials.

Johnetta Elzie, a protester, was tear-gassed in Ferguson in 2014 and again last week in Washington, D.C. She has relished the growing calls for reimagining public safety rather than fixing the police. “You know, if the training worked,” she said, “we wouldn’t be here.”

“I’ve been like having lots of déjà vu,” she added. “Lots.”

Calls for Transforming Police Run Into Realities of Governing in Minnesota,"MINNEAPOLIS — The calls for sweeping reforms to policing that have reverberated since the death of George Floyd slammed into the messy realities of lawmaking on Friday, offering a glimpse of the uncertainties of turning protest into policy.

Nearly a week after nine members of the Minneapolis City Council made a drastic pledge to take apart the Police Department, the council took its first steps on Friday in a slow, complicated process that could eventually lead to shifting funds from the city police. But that process will last for more than a year and require voters to actually approve of removing the Police Department from the city’s core departments.

And in the State Capitol, an ambitious package of police reforms proposed by Democrats faced an uncertain future as Republicans who control the State Senate said they would oppose some of the most far-reaching changes, such as restoring voting rights to felons or putting the state’s attorney general, rather than local prosecutors, in charge of prosecuting killings by the police.

Republican leaders said they would support five less contentious measures, including banning chokeholds and providing more money for “de-escalation” training. Democrats said the Republicans’ proposals fell short of the fundamental changes that tens of thousands of people have demanded in how the police treat black men and women and other people of color.

“We should do the work that the people have demanded that we do,” Melissa Hortman, speaker of the Minnesota House and a Democrat, said in an interview.

There is not much time for finding common ground. As a special session got underway on Friday to address policing, the economy and the coronavirus, leading Republicans said they hoped to wrap up all of their work by the end of next week.

“We’re not going to stay in special session for months and months,” State Senator Paul Gazelka, the Republican majority leader, said at a briefing on Friday. “We’re going to do the things we can do now.”

It was a sobering reality check for Democrats who have embraced activists’ calls for transformative changes that include going as far as cutting the budgets of local police departments or drastically rethinking how the police interact with people in their communities.

“This is not what Minnesotans of all persuasions are asking us to do,” said State Senator Jeff Hayden, a Democrat whose district includes the Minneapolis neighborhood where Mr. Floyd died after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes.

Still, police departments, cities and states across the country have already made a flurry of changes after the upheaval, including re-examining police budgets, banning chokeholds and removing officers from schools.

On Friday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York signed a broad package of bills aimed at combating police brutality. Some of the bills had languished for years in the face of opposition from police unions. The bills included a ban on the use of chokeholds as well as the repeal of a decades-old statute that had allowed the police to keep disciplinary records of officers secret.

But while Minnesota has become ground zero for protests, it is also showing the enduring obstacles facing the overarching changes many activists are demanding, especially in a 2020 battleground that is the only state in the nation where Democrats and Republicans each control one of the two legislative chambers.

While Democrats and liberal activists are leading the calls for change on the streets of American cities, many state governments are controlled by Republicans who back law enforcement and are leery of proposals to defund police departments or make it easier to sue officers. Polling is showing support for many reforms but widespread opposition to defunding the police, a term that can mean different things in different cities.

Reform efforts in Washington face similar challenges after Democrats unveiled a sweeping bill this week aimed at addressing racial bias and the overuse of force in policing.

In Minneapolis, the City Council’s move to reduce the role of the Police Department was hailed by activists as a transformational change and condemned by conservatives as a lurch toward lawlessness.

Wayne Reyes Jr., whose father was shot and killed by Minneapolis police officers in 2006, said he was hopeful that lawmakers would make meaningful changes this time, but said he was angry it had taken more killings for them to do so. Derek Chauvin, the former officer who has been charged with killing Mr. Floyd, was one of the officers who opened fire at Mr. Reyes’s father, Wayne Reyes Sr., a Native American man who the police said aimed a shotgun at them.

“It seems like people have been asking for these changes for a long time,” Mr. Reyes, 35, said in an interview, “and it wasn’t until just the last couple of weeks that people are starting to look and listen a little bit.”

On Friday, Minneapolis’s efforts to alter policing in the city appeared mostly to be a slow, governmental grind. To achieve its aims of dismantling the Police Department as it currently exists, the City Council plans to ask voters to approve rewriting a section of the City Charter to eliminate a provision that dictates a minimum number of police officers. That change would give council members much more flexibility to divert funds to mental health and other agencies that could respond to calls traditionally handled by the police.

The ballot initiative would also include removing the Minneapolis Police Department from the charter — although not necessarily abolishing it altogether — and adding a new department “focused on cultivating public safety.”

The City Council also voted unanimously, at its virtual meeting, on a resolution to commit to a yearlong effort to research other models of public safety and to listen to what residents say they would like to see.

Andrea Jenkins, the vice president of the City Council, said the world was looking to Minneapolis to see how it would respond after the killing of Mr. Floyd last month.

“People have marched all over the world, all over the city of Minneapolis, and what they’re saying to us is they want change,” Ms. Jenkins said. “Not ‘fix it,’ not reform, but change. So we must take these voices seriously.”

The resolution passed on Friday creates a “Future of Community Safety Work Group” that will soon begin listening to residents, interviewing experts and studying other models of public safety to determine how various city services could replace many of the Police Department’s current functions.

Alondra Cano, the chairwoman of the public safety committee, said in an interview after the vote that the engagement of city residents would be vital to determining the right solutions for public safety in Minneapolis.

“The beauty of this project is that the answers come from the community, that collectively, the future of this city will be decided by the people who live here,” Ms. Cano said.

She added that the initiative to get rid of the City Charter’s requirement that the Police Department have .0017 employees per city resident would remove a large hurdle that stands in the way of redirecting funds from the police to violence prevention programs and other city agencies. If the initiative does get on the ballot in November, it would require a majority of voters to pass."
One Big Difference About George Floyd Protests: Many White Faces,"As crowds have surged through American cities to protest the killing of George Floyd, one of the striking differences from years past has been the sheer number of white people.

From Minneapolis to Washington, D.C., marchers noticed the change, and wondered what it meant that so many white Americans were showing up for the cause of justice for black Americans.

“I was shocked to see so many white kids out here,” said Walter Wiggins, 67, as he sat near the heart of the protests in Washington last week. Mr. Wiggins, a retired federal worker, who is black, remembered attending the March on Washington in 1963 and other civil rights events with his parents. “Back then, it was just black folks.”

Why is this happening now? The video of a white police officer refusing to remove his knee from Mr. Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes has horrified Americans as attitudes on race were already changing, particularly among white liberals. Another driver is opposition to President Trump. Protests beginning the day after his election drew large crowds. Finally, there is the coronavirus pandemic, which has left millions of Americans — including college students — cooped up at home, craving human contact. The result was hundreds of thousands of white Americans in the streets.

“This is utterly different from anything we’ve seen,” said Douglas McAdam, a sociologist at Stanford who studies social movements, referring to the recent protests. Since the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014, every highly publicized death of an African-American man while in police custody brought protests, he said, “but overwhelmingly in the black community.”

The pattern evident in the streets has now been confirmed by early demographic data: Researchers fanned out across three American cities last weekend and found overwhelmingly young crowds with large numbers of white and highly educated people.

A team of 11 volunteers asked every fifth person they encountered to fill out a survey and gathered data from 195 people in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. The researchers, Dana R. Fisher, a sociologist at the University of Maryland, and Michael T. Heaney, a political scientist at University of Michigan, used an established method for studying street protests. They said their numbers provided only rough estimates, but offer the first, more systematic look at who the protesters are.

White protesters made up 61 percent of those surveyed in New York over the weekend, according to the researchers, and 65 percent of protesters in Washington. On Sunday in Los Angeles, 53 percent of protesters were white.

It is not just protests. White Americans are going through a wave of self-examination, buying books about racism, talking to black friends, and arguing within their own families. Still, how much of this translates into broader change remains to be seen.

“All of these white people on the front lines of these protests go back to their white neighborhoods and their overwhelmingly white and better schools,” said Hakeem Jefferson, a political scientist at Stanford University. “They protest alongside them, but they don’t live alongside them,” he said, referring to black people.

He added: “As much as people really want that progress narrative, I don’t think it exists yet.”

While opinion polls on race do not always capture what people actually think, surveys have shown that racial attitudes among white Americans have been shifting. There has been a sudden and sharp turn by white liberals toward a much more sympathetic view of black people in recent years, said Andrew Engelhardt, a postdoctoral researcher at Brown University, who has published papers documenting the shift.

“In the last 10 years or so we’ve seen something unprecedented with white Democrats,” Dr. Engelhardt said.

Racial groups tend to feel warmest toward their own group. White people favor white people, and black people favor black people. But by 2018, white liberals felt more positively about blacks, Latinos and Asians than they did about whites. That reversal surfaced in a recent poll by the Pew Research Center: About 49 percent of white Democrats said it bothered them that their nominee would be a white man, while just 28 percent of black Democrats said so.

The researchers who collected data last weekend found that the crowds were overwhelmingly young and well educated. More than three quarters of those surveyed were under the age of 34, and 82 percent of white protesters had a college degree, while 67 percent of black protesters had one.

Younger Americans are much more racially diverse than earlier generations and tend to have different views on race.

“My parents have a lot of learning to do,” said Isabel Muir, 22, a recent college graduate, who was standing in front of St. John’s Church on Saturday in Washington. She said she was having conversations on social media, and with her mother, about “how to be a white ally.”

When her mother, who is 62, questioned the property destruction during some protests, Ms. Muir said she told her that “we have to understand this community’s pain. This economy has been built on their backs.”

Mr. Trump also appeared to be a powerful driver. Forty-five percent of white people surveyed in Dr. Fisher’s work selected Mr. Trump as a motivation for joining the protests, compared with 32 percent of black people. White people were most likely to report having attended the 2017 Women’s March, but the second-least likely, after Asians, to report having attended the March for Racial Justice in 2017.

“My outrage for Trump is so strong,” said Tanya Holtzapple, 56, who is white, walking in a crowd of people on I Street on Saturday in Washington. Since he was elected, she said, she has felt “energized,” and marching was channeling that energy. “I’m not just sitting at home,” she said.

Since 2017, as many as 27 million people have taken part in protests opposing Mr. Trump, equal to about 8 percent of the population, according to researchers from Harvard University and the University of Connecticut.

These protests are part of that surge, said Dr. Fisher, who compiled the data on the protests last weekend. Groups like Indivisible, March On and Swing Left, whose goal is to prevent Mr. Trump’s re-election, may see joining the protests against police brutality both as a moral necessity and a way to “expand their tent,” she said.

“It’s emblematic of this moment, which is about the big-L left starting to pay attention to this issue,” Dr. Fisher said. “Groups not typically focused on racial justice and police brutality are turning people out.”

White Americans have taken part in struggles for racial equality at times — as abolitionists in the 19th century and Freedom Riders in the 1960s. But scholars of race in America said it remained to be seen whether a heightened awareness of racial injustice now would lead to broad change. Condemning the killing of Mr. Floyd, said Jennifer Chudy, a political scientist at Wellesley College, was “relatively costless.”

“Who is going out on a limb when they are distancing themselves from murder?” Dr. Chudy asked. Her work has shown that most white Americans have sympathy for a stark story of a sufferer and a villain — much like in the video of Mr. Floyd’s death — but far lower rates of sympathy for more abstract mistreatment, like a polluting bus depot in a mostly-black neighborhood. Some participants will become passionate for life, she said, but most will not. For some of them, “it may be nothing more than a fad.”

In a recent Monmouth University poll, 71 percent of white respondents called racism and discrimination “a big problem” in the United States, a spike since 2015. But Dr. Jefferson, the political scientist at Stanford, argued that it was too early to declare that a national reckoning had arrived. He pointed to another finding in the same poll: Just 49 percent of white Americans say that the police are more likely to use excessive force against a black culprit.

Karyn Wills, 57, who came to the protest in Washington on Saturday, said she was hopeful. Dr. Wills, who is African-American and a medical doctor, remembers protesting as a child with her parents in Chicago. She raised her children in suburban Maryland, and said she believed their generation, which was so much more racially mixed than hers, would bring progress. “Some people out here are just curious — they’ll have a sign, post on social media, and life will go on,” she said. “But for some of them it really will spark change.”"

From the moment he rode down that escalator in June 2015, Donald Trump has peddled a muscular political message packaged in gauzy nostalgia. An argument for the future wrapped in a yearning for the past.

Make America Great Again. It’s a promise to return the country to past glory. A time of strength abroad. A time of prosperity at home. A time of “so much winning.”

A time that never really existed.

The past wasn’t all that great if you were, say, brown, black, Indigenous, L.G.B.T.Q., Jewish, Muslim, a woman, an immigrant, or plenty of other people. For a large swath of the country, the present is far from perfect, too. But few of them would want to turn back the clock to the days of more segregation, more open discrimination, more people in the closet.

Mr. Trump’s message focuses on the economy, but also taps into a vein of white political grievance. There have been a number of studies showing that’s exactly what happened in the 2016 election. Many white, Christian and male voters, academic research suggests, supported Mr. Trump not because of financial anxiety but because they felt their social status was at risk.

Those concerns were deeply intertwined with race. Support for Mr. Trump was closely linked to a belief that groups like whites, Christians or men faced more discrimination than groups like minorities, Muslims or women, according to various analyses of the election.

Public polling today indicates that the number of voters sympathetic to that view is shrinking — fast.

Public opinion on race and criminal justice issues has been creeping leftward since the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin in 2012. The killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month supercharged that shift, as my colleagues at the Upshot detailed on Wednesday.

Over the last two weeks, support for Black Lives Matter increased by nearly as much as it had over the previous two years, according to data from Civiqs, an online survey research firm. A series of polls shows a significant increase from just a few years ago in the belief that African-Americans face a lot of discrimination, and that it’s a “big problem.” A majority of Americans say that black Americans are more likely to be mistreated by the police, and that the mass protests in cities nationwide are justified.

“In my 35 years of polling, I’ve never seen opinion shift this fast or deeply,” Frank Luntz, a veteran Republican pollster, tweeted this week. “We are a different country today than just 30 days ago.”

Even within some of the most culturally conservative corners of the country, views are shifting. This week, NASCAR banned Confederate flags at races. The military is open to renaming its bases named after Confederate leaders. Statues of Confederate solders, slave owners and race-baiting politicians are falling like dominoes.

The country is changing; Mr. Trump is not.

Rather than acknowledge the realities of systemic racism, he attacks protesters and militarizes the area around the White House. He has yet to deliver a speech devoted to race or reconciliation, instead posting near-daily tweets extolling “Law and Order!” He’s returning to the campaign trail on Juneteenth (June 19), a day dedicated to honoring black emancipation, in Tulsa, Okla., a city with a devastating history of racial violence. He lends credibility to the views of white nationalists on Twitter.

Mr. Trump delivered some of his most extensive comments on the protests at an appearance today at a Dallas church, but his strongest sympathies were reserved for the police, as he repeated his call to “dominate the street.” He said he would sign an order to encourage better police practices, but stayed away from broader proposals to address racial injustice.

“We have to work together to confront bigotry and prejudice wherever they appear, but we will make no progress and heal no wounds by falsely labeling tens of millions of decent Americans as racist or bigots,” he said.

Though Mr. Trump’s hard-core supporters stand with him, other Republicans are following the country’s lead. Senator Mitt Romney marched with protesters on Sunday, trying to create a permission structure for Republican voters. Acknowledging that voters want action, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, tapped Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the lone black Republican in his ranks, to lead an effort on how to address police misconduct.

Mr. Trump’s November opponent, Joe Biden, once declared that “nothing would fundamentally change” under his presidency, and he faced criticism during the Democratic primary over his legislative record on race and nostalgia for the past. But Mr. Biden, long a reliable ally of law enforcement, supports overhauling the police, as does nearly all of his party.

Few Democrats have embraced the calls to “defund the police” issued by activists. But there is a growing sense that something fundamental has gone awry in America.

In his inauguration address, Mr. Trump described “American carnage,” outlining a doomsday vision of a country ravaged by economic disaster, violence and fear.

For many Americans, that carnage has now arrived, visited upon us by a virus, a recession and social unrest. For others, including many of those protesting, the carnage was always there.

If Mr. Trump loses in November, the carnage may be self-inflicted.

Not too long ago, America was in the middle of just two main crises: the stubbornly persistent coronavirus pandemic that has taken more than 100,000 American lives, and the sharp recession that it caused — the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression by several measures. Since then, the killing of George Floyd, a black Minnesotan, in police custody has spurred widespread outrage, historic protests against police brutality, and a national reckoning with racism.

But a severely battered economy remains the backdrop of all these other big news stories. And now, as the initial emergency funds Congress appropriated in March near expiration, elected officials are debating how much more federal aid should be given, if any at all.

Opinion columnist Paul Krugman warned in an article this week that the latest jobs report, which showed a slightly improved employment situation, “may be bad for future policy.” The American economy “is still very much on life support,” he wrote, “and a bit of good news is all too likely to encourage the usual suspects to end that life support too soon.”

Mr. Krugman’s fellow economist (and sometime rival) Stephanie Kelton wrote an opinion essay, adapted from her new book “The Deficit Myth,” not only agreeing with the need for more aid but also arguing that as long as inflation remains low, a currency-issuing superpower like the United States can spend without fear or raising taxes. She concluded: “To lift America out of its current economic crisis, Congress does not need to ‘find the money,’ as many say, in order to spend more. It just needs to find the votes and the political will.”

An Eyesore Becomes an Icon,"WASHINGTON — In its brief life, the black chain-link fence surrounding the White House has gone from reviled to beloved to something of a capital landmark, however temporary. As with so much in America these days, perspectives change fast.

“We’ve taken the negativity of this wall and made it into something positive,” declared Adele McClure, who was part of a crowd of a few hundred protesters outside the White House late Tuesday night.

Ms. McClure, of Arlington, Va., said her perspective had shifted rapidly about the fence. “At first I thought it was messed up,” she said. It was a sign of a leader who was isolating himself behind a fortress. But she now views the structure — which was installed to protect the White House from people demonstrating against the killing caught on video of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in police custody — as a symbol of hope, beauty and “people coming together to transcend walls.”

Other protesters were perusing the chain-linked collage of signs, messages and artwork that covered nearly every part of the 8-foot barrier across Lafayette Park — a kind of chaotic bulletin board cluttered with “Black Lives Matter” logos, renderings of Mr. Floyd and statements of ridicule, often profane, aimed at the president who lived inside the barricades.

The protesters were studying the structure less as a forbidding obstacle than as a makeshift art installation. It was evidence that cries for help like those of Mr. Floyd, who gasped for air and called out to his dead mother as a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, can transform into rallying cries. Or that an eyesore can become an icon.

It was unclear how long the actual fence would remain here. The National Park Service said on Tuesday that the structure would be gone on or about Wednesday, but then said on Wednesday that it was in discussions with the Secret Service about the fencing around Lafayette Park.

As of midday Wednesday, the fence and concrete barriers enclosing the Ellipse on the south side of the White House had been removed and hauled out by big, yellow trucks. But the fence on the northern perimeter that kept people out of Lafayette Square was still there.

Several people who had attended protests here said the fence had become a must-see attraction for them, a monument to how random citizens can reclaim a democratic space — how the so-called People’s House can be animated from all sides.

Protesters and passers-by could be seen at all hours of the day and night taking photos of the metal canvass. They filmed videos of themselves narrating the messages and signs along a two-block stretch of H Street, between Vermont Avenue and 17th Street:

“Even the Old Suburban Guys are Mad Now.”

“8 minutes, 46 seconds.”

“How Many Weren’t Filmed?”

“Color is not a Crime.”

The atmosphere among the protesters has changed considerably in recent nights, a marked departure from the tense and sporadically violent clashes with the police in front of the White House last week.

While still heavily policed and fortified, the area has acquired some of the ambience of a street fair, with artists painting murals of Mr. Floyd on plywood storefronts and street merchants hawking Black Lives Matter and “I Can’t Breathe” T-shirts and face masks. Chants of protesters mingled with the carnival music of ice cream trucks clustered down 16th Street. The police were arrayed farther from the White House than they had been last week, their presence reduced around Lafayette Park.

Early Wednesday morning, presumably in anticipation of the removal of the north perimeter fence, workers had taken the artwork and reassembled it in front of office buildings across H Street. It was unclear how long the artifacts would remain there, where they would end up or whether they would receive some permanent display.

But a new consensus appeared to be at hand among the protesters: These signs, flags and mementos were part of history. They should be preserved and cared for as such, as artifacts of a formative moment that was still unfolding.

“As a black person, there are a lot of places that you can’t go, and this wall is symbolic of that,” said Daniel Crittenden, 29, who had just arrived in Washington after an eight-hour drive from his home near Hartford, Conn. “But it is also symbolic of a movement to surmount walls that is going on all across the country.”

Mr. Crittenden said he had never been to Washington before, and he felt overwhelmed by the volume of material to reflect on along the fence. “It is a lot to take in,” he said, adding that he hoped some government agency, like the National Archives, would collect and catalog the artwork whenever the fencing came down.

Either way, he said, it was important to witness these changes in real time. It felt like history, he said.

“All of a sudden it feels like an exciting time and a hopeful time,” he said. “It’s also a sad time, but there is always that duality in black life. There’s tragedy and triumph and joy and perseverance, all working together. You definitely feel that here.”"
"Trump Defends Police, but Says He’ll Sign Order Encouraging Better Practices","President Trump offered only a vague policy response on Thursday to the killing of George Floyd, saying he would sign an executive order encouraging better practices by police departments while rejecting more far-reaching proposals to tackle racial injustice and police brutality in the United States.

Dismissing police misconduct as the work of only a few “bad apples,” Mr. Trump strongly defended law enforcement agencies and made clear he had little interest in broader legislation being debated in Congress. At a round-table discussion he convened in a Dallas church before hosting a campaign fund-raiser, the president derided activists calling for defunding or dismantling police departments.

“Instead, we have to go the opposite way,” Mr. Trump said. “We must invest more energy and resources in police training and recruiting and community engagement. We have to respect our police — we have to take care of our police. They’re protecting us, and if they’re allowed to do their job, they’ll do a great job. You always have a bad apple no matter where you go. You have bad apples. There are not too many of them, and I can tell you there are not too many of them in the police department.”

The president’s staunch defense of the police came as city, state and federal lawmakers in both parties were working to develop sweeping proposals to change the way policing works in the United States. Mr. Trump was more explicit in what he would not back than what he would, beyond repeating his support for expanding economic development, investing in medical facilities and encouraging school choice in minority communities.

He said, without elaborating, that the executive order being drafted would encourage police departments “to meet the most current professional standards for the use of force.”

And while he called the killing of Mr. Floyd “a disgrace,” the president referred to it only in passing and instead castigated critics who have said law enforcement is afflicted with systemic racism that needs to be addressed.

“We have to work together to confront bigotry and prejudice wherever they appear, but we’ll make no progress and heal no wounds by falsely labeling tens of millions of decent Americans as racists or bigots,” Mr. Trump said. “We have to get everybody together. We have to be in the same path.”

Campaigning on Thursday in Pennsylvania, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, criticized Mr. Trump for sowing division in the country. Mr. Trump, he said, had “decided that he was going to pit us against one another based on race,” recalling the president’s comments after a white nationalist rally in 2017 in Charlottesville, Va.

“When a president speaks, no matter how good or bad he is, people listen,” Mr. Biden said at a round table of his own. He said that when Mr. Trump “speaks and gives credibility” to racist people, “they come out from under the rocks.”

“And you’re seeing it,” he added. “You’re seeing it all across the country.”

The former vice president said the killing of Mr. Floyd had a larger effect globally than the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. did in 1968. “Even Dr. King’s assassination did not have the worldwide impact that George Floyd’s death did,” Mr. Biden said at his event, where he rolled out a new eight-part plan to reopen the economy after months of lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Mr. Biden, speaking in West Philadelphia in a room that was the original home of “American Bandstand,” noted that the prevalence today of cellphones that can record episodes of police misconduct had “changed the way everybody’s looking at this.”

“Look at the millions of people marching around the world,” Mr. Biden said, a face mask dangling from his left ear. “So my point is that I think people are really realizing that this is a battle for the soul of America. Who are we? What do we want to be? How do we see ourselves? What do we think we should be? Character is on the ballot here.”

Mr. Biden met with Mr. Floyd’s family in Houston this week and recorded a video message for his funeral. He has called for “real police reform” and has emphasized the need to address systemic racism in society.

Mr. Trump’s trip to Dallas came as he resumed campaigning after a monthslong suspension forced by the virus. The president trails Mr. Biden both nationally and in key swing states. Even in Texas, a Republican bulwark for decades, a half-dozen surveys since April show the Democrat in striking distance with the incumbent. A Quinnipiac University poll released last week showed Mr. Trump with 44 percent and Mr. Biden with 43 percent, and a Public Policy Polling survey showed a tie at 48 percent.

In addition to a possible battleground, Texas is seeing its coronavirus infections on the rise after the reopening of businesses and public life. Three of the 10 counties in the United States with the highest number of new cases per resident in the past two weeks are in Texas: Jones, Moore and Walker. Even as Mr. Trump visited, Dallas County reported 312 new cases on Thursday, its highest number yet and the third straight day of a record.

Mr. Trump brought with him not only Attorney General William P. Barr but also two of the only prominent black members of his administration — Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, and Dr. Jerome M. Adams, the surgeon general.

Meeting with police union leaders and religious leaders at Gateway Church, Mr. Trump did not invite any of the top three law enforcement officials in Dallas, all of them African-American, according to The Dallas Morning News. Not included in the event were Chief U. Reneé Hall of the Dallas Police Department, Sheriff Marian Brown or District Attorney John Creuzot.

Mr. Trump did invite Vernell E. Dooley — the police chief of Glenn Heights, a town of about 11,000 south of Dallas — who is African-American — and he praised the president’s efforts on Thursday.

As Mr. Trump prepared to fly to Dallas on Thursday, Chief Hall’s department posted a Twitter message that said, “Let’s work together to end racism,” and included a video showing police officers kneeling with and hugging protesters, with the caption “Because Black lives do matter.”

After his fund-raiser, where donors paid $580,600 each for a meal and a photograph, Mr. Trump will fly to New Jersey for a long weekend at his Bedminster golf club. On June 19, he plans to hold his first campaign rally in months in Tulsa, Okla.

A Black Running Mate for Biden? More Democrats Are Making the Case,"Early last month, about a dozen leading black activists and Democratic political strategists joined a private call with Joseph R. Biden Jr. in which they made the case for selecting an African-American running mate.

Building on a public letter signed by African-American women across the country, the group outlined how a black vice-presidential pick could help the campaign expand and energize the African-American electorate, according to people on the call.

Mr. Biden spoke in broad strokes about the qualities he was looking for in a vice president, and he did not make any commitment. But participants came away believing that they had opened a substantive line of communication with the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, who had already promised to select a woman as his running mate.

One month later, amid a national reckoning over racism and police brutality, the subject of that private discussion has taken on more public urgency at every level of the Democratic Party. Longtime lawmakers and young liberal activists, state party officials and Biden loyalists have been increasingly vocal about their view that in a moment of extraordinary national upheaval over race, Mr. Biden must give deeper consideration to placing a black woman on the ticket.

“I think there will be some pressure,” said Chuck Hagel, who served as defense secretary in the administration of President Barack Obama and before that as a Republican senator from Nebraska, and who is supporting Mr. Biden. “If there’s a problem — injustice, inequality — wouldn’t it be smart to pick an African-American woman as your running mate? There’s a strong argument there. I think that the strength of that argument has just accelerated.”

Mr. Hagel, who served with Mr. Biden in the Senate and is friends with former Senator Christopher J. Dodd — a member of Mr. Biden’s vice-presidential search committee — said he was offering his assessment of the unfolding political dynamics and not making any personal recommendation. But it is a view shared by a growing number of Biden supporters of diverse ages, races and political backgrounds.

Some note that Mr. Biden’s seemingly moribund candidacy early in the Democratic primary campaign was reinvigorated by black voters.

“His campaign got revived because of the African-American community,” said Gilberto Hinojosa, the chairman of the Texas Democratic Party. “I just think it would be the right thing to do.”

Others speak of the need to energize young voters of color who were uninspired by the 2016 Democratic presidential ticket, warning that summer protests in the streets are not guaranteed to translate into votes in November. And increasingly, many are arguing that for a presidential candidate who values experience in a running mate, personal familiarity with navigating the most searing issues confronting the nation should be a relevant qualification.

“Just like in ’08 — when President Obama selected someone that would help him govern, someone that could hit the ground running on recovery efforts in ’09 — when Joe Biden is elected in November, his running mate, the next vice president, would hit the ground running to address the crisis we have in our nation,” said Clay Middleton, a member of the Democratic National Committee and a well-known South Carolina strategist. “Of the plight of African-Americans, and law enforcement, police reform, a plethora of issues.”

Among those on the private call last month with Mr. Biden were the Democratic strategists Donna Brazile, Leah D. Daughtry, Minyon Moore and Karen Finney; the lawyer and media personality Star Jones; Roslyn M. Brock, the chairman emeritus of the national board of directors for the N.A.A.C.P.; and a lengthy list of activists in civil rights, labor and other issues, according to a readout intended for women who had signed the original petition. Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, and two senior advisers, Anita Dunn and Symone D. Sanders, were also listed as participants, as was Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester, a Delaware Democrat and a member of Mr. Biden’s vice-presidential search committee. A Biden spokesman declined to comment.

“In the moment of our deepest racial division and crisis, really being able to have a ticket that is as reflective of the future and diversity of America as what we’re seeing happen in the streets right now — that, that is the opportunity,” said LaTosha Brown, co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund. “If there was a time in America we needed the leadership of a black woman, it is now.”

Ms. Brown, who was also listed as a participant in the call with Mr. Biden, declined to comment on the conversation, but said of the campaign, “I think there’s an openness to explore.”

Mr. Biden, 77, has been clear for months about some of his criteria for a running mate. He wants to choose someone with whom he is “simpatico” on major issues and strategy, even if they disagree on tactics. His vice president must be prepared on “Day 1,” he has said, to assume the presidency if need be. He wants to have open conversations and a strong level of trust with his running mate, he has said, just as he and Mr. Obama did.

He has also suggested he wants someone who will balance the ticket and who “has capacities in areas that I do not,” he said at a fund-raiser last month.

Mr. Biden’s closest allies — including Representative James E. Clyburn, the highest-ranking African-American in Congress, who would prefer that Mr. Biden choose a black woman — have been careful to stress that ultimately Mr. Biden must prioritize his personal connections to the contenders and be mindful of polling and vetting. And in an interview with CBS News’s Norah O’Donnell, Mr. Biden said that the events of the past two weeks “haven’t” affected his choice, “except it’s put a greater focus and urgency on the need to get someone who is totally simpatico with where I am,” on matters including “the systemic things that you want to change.”

As part of a broader list, Mr. Biden is thought to be considering a number of black women as running mates. Senator Kamala Harris of California; Representative Val Demings of Florida; Stacey Abrams, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Georgia governor; Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta; and former National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice are often discussed among Mr. Biden’s allies.

Ms. Harris, a favorite of many Biden donors, appeared at a virtual fund-raiser with Mr. Biden on Tuesday. And amid the national unrest following the death of George Floyd, a black man, at the hands of the police, Ms. Demings — a former Orlando chief of police — and Ms. Bottoms, who has spoken out passionately against racism while seeking order in her city, have caught fresh attention among some Biden supporters and donors.

Some allies suggest that the upheaval following Mr. Floyd’s killing has heightened the need for someone who can speak to passionate concerns around race, especially among a younger generation that Democrats need to turn out in the fall. The African-American contenders Mr. Biden is thought to be considering are substantially younger than he is.

Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware and a close Biden ally, said the former vice president had seen weeks ago that the national moment called for a running mate who would help a Biden administration embrace “a new generation of leadership.”

“The sharpness of this past week, after the killing of George Floyd, I think heightens it, but I think Joe saw that moment clearly before this,” Mr. Coons said in an interview this month.

Mr. Biden and his team have long heard from allies about their preferences for the vice-presidential slot. As members of his search committee have started evaluating candidates in recent weeks, they have also been in touch with prominent leaders in the Democratic Party to talk through options.

“I’ve tried to give Vice President Biden the best ideas that I have regarding vice president,” said former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada. “More than advice, what I’m doing is trying to respond to questions that they have.”

In an interview late last month, Mr. Reid said Mr. Dodd had called him that day to discuss a particular candidate.

“We went over that person that I have worked with, and everything I could think of about her, I gave him,” said Mr. Reid, who declined to name the candidate discussed that day.

Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, said she had also been contacted by the search committee for her views. In an interview, she said that there are a number of contenders who connect with communities of color. Some early public polling, for instance, has shown that Ms. Warren, who is white, has strength among some voters of color, and throughout her presidential campaign she repeatedly pressed plans to combat racial and economic inequity.

Still, she said that she expected the prospect of an African-American vice-presidential pick has “become more of a consideration” even as other candidates remain in the running.

“It’s part of the symbolism,” she said. “Of showing that you’re listening.”"
Philonise Floyd Speaks Out: ‘I’m Here to Ask You to Make It Stop’,"Good morning and welcome to On Politics, a daily political analysis of the 2020 elections based on reporting by New York Times journalists.

Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.

A brother’s testimony, and new virus worries. It’s Thursday, and this is your politics tip sheet.

Democrats in the House heard heartfelt, impassioned testimony yesterday from Philonise Floyd, George Floyd’s brother, and several experts on criminal justice and restorative justice. “I’m here to ask you to make it stop,” Philonise Floyd told members of the Judiciary Committee, in the first round of hearings as the Democrats push a sweeping police overhaul bill. Republicans have sought to delay the bill, pledging to unveil one of their own within days.

“I am asking you, is that what a black man’s life is worth? Twenty dollars?” Philonise Floyd said, referring to the counterfeit $20 bill that his brother was said to have used just before he died at the hands of the Minneapolis police. “This is 2020. Enough is enough. The people marching in the streets are telling you, enough is enough.” 

Voter support for the Black Lives Matter movement has undergone a big spike since the protests began, new survey data collected over the past two weeks shows. Some of the most pronounced increases were among middle-aged Americans and those with higher educations.

Military officials had just begun to express a new level of openness to removing Confederate names from Army bases — but then President Trump shot that idea down. “These Monumental and very Powerful Bases have become part of a Great American Heritage,” he wrote. “Therefore, my Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations.”

In the Senate, representatives of public schools across the country told the Education Committee that they needed additional money to safely reopen in the fall, amid a possible resurgence of the coronavirus. School leaders are already outlining sometimes-ambitious plans to welcome more than 50 million students back to school nationwide. They anticipate procuring 50 million masks; staffing schools with additional nurses, aides and counselors; and maintaining social distancing by staggering classes.

The virus continues to spread, though slightly less quickly than earlier in the spring. But on both sides of the aisle, in both houses of Congress, legislators appear to have turned their attention away from virus relief — at least for the time being.

Trump, meanwhile, appears ready to hit the campaign trail again. The White House announced that his first rally since the start of the outbreak will take place in Tulsa, Okla., on June 19. That’s a week from Friday. Officials close to the campaign said it was unlikely attendees would be asked to observe social distancing or wear masks.

The announcement is laden with (unstated) historical resonances: Trump will be effectively restarting his in-person presidential campaign on Juneteenth, an unofficial holiday celebrating African-Americans’ freedom from enslavement. Tulsa also has a particular significance in black history, as the site of arguably the most violent and destructive white mob violence against African-Americans in the early 20th century, exactly 99 years ago this month.

“Gross abuse of prosecutorial power:” That’s how a judge described the Justice Department’s decision to drop charges against Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, who had pleaded guilty to perjury.

John Gleeson, a former mafia prosecutor and federal judge, issued a 73-page brief yesterday condemning the decision, which had been prompted by William Barr, the attorney general. The judge in the case, Emmet Sullivan, will now decide whether to order the department to proceed with prosecution or pursue some other course. Meanwhile, an appeals court is reviewing a Justice Department motion to bypass Sullivan and drop the charges immediately.

Brian Benczkowski, the head of the Justice Department’s criminal division, who had signed the filing asking Sullivan to dismiss charges, is leaving the administration. He said he had planned the move months ago, in conversations with Barr.

Benczkowski was confirmed in 2018 despite Democratic concerns about his work for Russia’s Alfa-Bank, which the F.B.I. linked to the Trump Organization during the 2016 campaign. In his tenure at the criminal division, Benczkowski prosecuted cases around the opioid crisis and used data analytics to alter the division’s approach to investigating fraud and other abuses.

Philonise Floyd told members of Congress that watching the video of his brother’s death felt like “8 hours and 46 minutes.”

In New York City, restaurants and stores began to reopen this week after the mayor lifted parts of a broad shutdown order. In many Southern and rural states, reopening started more than a month ago.

But even now, three months in, the coronavirus crisis continues to rob us of many of the social conventions and gatherings that used to give us grounding.

A Monmouth University poll released yesterday tells us that going to sporting events is one thing most Americans say they miss. The public remains deeply divided over whether to reopen, but there’s broad agreement that with the advent of summer, it would feel good to attend a game.

Roughly six in 10 Americans said they missed being able to go to live sporting events at least a little bit, according to the Monmouth poll. That held true across party identification, education and income levels (though, unsurprisingly, the wealthiest Americans were the most likely to say they missed being able to attend a sports event). Women were eight percentage points less likely to say so than men, but a majority still did.

With a few months’ perspective on the lockdown routine, Americans also expressed an awareness that even when self-isolation is done in the name of health, it can have unhealthy consequences. In a Fairleigh Dickinson University poll released yesterday, 54 percent of Americans expressed concern that they or a loved one might see their health endangered because the pandemic had prevented them from getting care for other health problems.

But when it comes to whether Americans think their local officials should reopen for business, the slimmest majority are still not ready to go that far. Fifty percent of people, according to a CNN poll out yesterday, said that based on the current situation, they weren’t ready to return to their regular routine. Forty-nine percent said they were. The partisan differences were stark: While 73 percent of Republicans said they were ready to go back to the old routine, just 23 percent of Democrats did.

And while some states have had a drop in cases, others are experiencing a surge. Fourteen states and Puerto Rico this month have reported new weekly highs in cases, according to a Washington Post analysis.

"For George Floyd’s Mourners, What Does ‘Justice’ Mean?","HOUSTON — Hundreds of American flags lined the street outside George Floyd’s funeral services, as if the deceased were a member of law enforcement, not a black man killed in its custody.

The line to view his body included parents with children, co-workers, and well-wishers from out of town, many clad in black. Throughout the country, Mr. Floyd’s death has become the catalyst for protests, kicking off a national wave of reckoning with inequities that has spread from policing to the worlds of entertainment, business and media. In Houston, where Mr. Floyd grew up before moving north to Minneapolis, it was an outpouring of pain and grief.

Mya Little, 19, left the Fountain of Peace church after viewing the body, with her mother at her side.

“I do not know what we have to do, but living like this isn’t it,” she said. “Being scared to go places? Being scared to move around freely? This isn’t justice.”

To answer the pain and fear Ms. Little and millions of others have expressed in the days since Mr. Floyd’s killing last month, Democratic elected officials have taken to calling out the “systemic racism” of America. It is a phrase used to convey how institutions like law enforcement need a drastic overhaul — if not total dismantling.

But it is not clear how much will happen after officials point out the deep-rooted flaw in the system, and some progressive Democrats and activists are saying they’re worried that politicians are using the language of systemic reform but stopping short of the more radical policies to address it, such as redirecting funding from law enforcement to housing and education.

In a recent speech, former President Barack Obama said, “In a lot of ways, what has happened over the last several weeks is, challenges and structural problems here in the United States have been thrown into high relief.” Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president and presumptive Democratic nominee for president, used a similar construction: The moment, he explained, highlighted how foundational racism is in this country.

“We need to root out systemic racism across our laws and institutions, and we need to make sure black Americans have a real shot to get ahead,” Mr. Biden said in an opinion piece on fixing policing published this week.

The language is searing. The proposed solutions in many cases go further than mainstream politicians have ever gone. But, set against how dire the politicians say the situation is, the suggested fixes feel to some activists like relics of a bygone era, proposals that could reduce harm, but fail to deliver structural change.

The U.S. Conference of Mayors has assembled a Police Reform and Racial Justice Working Group. Several cities have called for task forces. Congressional lawmakers introduced the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, which would ban chokeholds, create a model use of force standard, establish a National Police Misconduct Registry, and mandate training on biases including racial profiling.

Mr. Biden endorsed several of the congressional proposals, and said he would support tying federal aid to whether police departments “meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness.” In the same opinion article where he called out systemic racism, he proposed “getting cops out of their cruisers and building relationships with the people and the communities they are there to serve and protect.”

For younger progressive leaders, and some of the mourners at Mr. Floyd’s memorial services, this range of potential solutions amounts to a tacit reaffirmation to work within the system they have described as fundamentally broken. 

While the Minneapolis City Council attracted national attention for its call to divert resources from its police department to other methods of public safety, calling for a police-free future remains a policy outlier, and it has been rejected by progressive national leaders including Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. One initiative, called 8 Can’t Wait, pushed for immediate changes in police departments, including banning chokeholds and the practice of shooting at moving vehicles. Activists criticized it as an incremental position and a compromise, with a counter campaign describing it as “a slate of reforms that have already been tried and failed.” That campaign, called 8 to Abolition, emphasized prison abolition, ridding police departments of military-grade equipment, and diverting funds to safe housing.

Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, the progressive who represents part of Minneapolis, said some of the calls to action from the Democratic caucus were not enough.

“If we are not clear in proposing policies that undo the policies that have codified our pain and trauma, then we will be in the same state,” she said. 

She supports changes similar to some of the more far-reaching activist proposals, like diverting funding from law enforcement to other investments, and stressed that they were not “pie in the sky” ideas. 

Chokwe Antar Lumumba, the Democratic mayor of Jackson, Miss., said members of his party needed to be honest with their voters: police reform cannot fix systemic racism in policing.

“The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house,” he said, quoting the activist and writer Audre Lorde.

In the more than two weeks since he died, “Justice for George Floyd” has become an omnipresent mantra, but there remains little agreement on what that would mean from a public policy perspective.

For a growing consortium of progressive groups focused on young voters, justice for Mr. Floyd requires dismantling police power and investing in programs related to mental health, housing and education — which activists believe would reduce crime and violence.

But among the larger Democratic electorate, including older black voters who helped Mr. Biden secure the nomination, many are holding out hope that police departments can change, and practices such as anti-bias training and better data collection can lead to improved relationships between the police and the community.

At Mr. Floyd’s public memorial Monday, the mood of the thousands who gathered to mourn was palpably different than at protests across the country. There were no uniform demands for defunding the police or antipathy for law enforcement. In many ways, the crowd reflected the breadth of opinion among black voters, including those who were encouraged by the Democratic Party’s response to the recent protests. It stood in stark contrast to the scenes in Minneapolis, where elected officials have been booed out of protests for refusing to commit to policy demands.

Yancy Carter, who brought his 14- and 17-year-old children to the public viewing, said “those who are in charge of the police departments need to make the tough calls to fire or suspend.” Tina Barron, a 47-year-old Houston woman, said she was confident that more training would help police departments.

“I’m sorry, I love my Democrats,” said Nadine Scott, a 60-year-old woman in Houston who took issue with the activists not focusing on Republicans. “We just need this energy in November to vote Trump out.”

Mayor Frank Scott Jr. of Little Rock, who ran as a police reformer, said respecting the diversity of opinion — especially among black voters, who are too often seen as a monolith by white Democrats — was critical to building lasting coalitions.

“As much as people like to shout about their desire for change,” he said, “when you try to implement change, it’s often met with resistance.”

The diversity of opinion from across the electorate may give Democrats ample room to craft a response that meets the moment. Naming the problem has become a political layup, especially considering the changing racial attitudes of white liberals in the era of President Trump.

But it’s proposing solutions that can be more divisive, leaving leaders who often aim for the biggest policy changes opting for small solutions.

Mr. Sanders, the democratic socialist, said he wanted to give police departments “the support they need to do their jobs better defined.” Other politicians, including Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, sought to redefine what activists have come to call defunding the police. He asserted in a recent news conference that “when they’re saying ‘defund the police,’ what are they saying? They’re saying we want fundamental basic change when it comes to policing — and they’re right.”

Mr. Biden’s political transformation on policing has carried him from writing a Senate bill with a Police Officer Bill of Rights in 1991 to kneeling in protest of police brutality this year. This week he rejected the idea of defunding the police outright.

Throughout his career, in Delaware and in national politics, Mr. Biden has relied on his close relationship with black communities. And like many politicians, including Mr. Obama, the former vice president has also leaned on themes of unity to inspire the country about racial progress — rather than prioritize things that may be currently unpopular.

Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia House minority leader and candidate for governor who is also in the running to be Mr. Biden’s vice-presidential pick, said in a recent interview that the willingness for more Democrats to call out systemic racism should be applauded. There was value in identifying systems of oppression, she said, even though it must be coupled with actions.

“If we want to dismantle an injustice system that does not see the humanity of these men and women, then we have to not only articulate what the broken pieces are, but we’ve got to then hire the right people to fix and make it better,” she said. “And that happens through voting.”

At the public viewing for Mr. Floyd’s body, that was the theme from many mourners — that police departments did not see black humanity. Warren Washington, a 56-year-old man who drove from Baton Rouge, La., said politicians, in this moment, had an opportunity to “show the world we’re the America we’ve pretended to be.”

“You have to acknowledge it, but you have to also break the system down in order to restore order and confidence,” Mr. Washington said.

Inside the Fountain of Peace church, where Mr. Floyd’s body lay in a tan suit, David Hester was inspired to rededicate his life’s mission.

“I looked at him in that coffin and I told him, ‘Your death will not be in vain,’” he said.

Mr. Hester expressed skepticism that police departments could be trusted to transform themselves. “You have the foxes manning the henhouse here,” he said.

He cited the way police officers have historically protected their own in times of crisis, sanitizing what actually transpired.

The original news release from the Minneapolis Police Department on Mr. Floyd’s death described the actions of the officers, like this:

The officers “were able to get the suspect in to handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress.”

No mention of the knee on his neck. No mention of his cries for help."
Protesters Topple Statue of Jefferson Davis on Richmond’s Monument Avenue,"Protesters toppled a statue of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War, in Richmond, Va., on Wednesday night, as demonstrators across the country continued to target symbols of white supremacy after the death of George Floyd.

Demonstrators knocked down the statue at about 11 p.m., according to The Richmond Times-Dispatch, and local news reports showed photographs of it lying on the street, with the police nearby before a tow truck carted it away.

The statue was among a number of prominent Confederate monuments that had stood on Monument Avenue in Richmond, which was once the capital of the Confederacy.

It came down one week after Mayor Levar Stoney of Richmond said that he would propose an ordinance to remove all four Confederate monuments that the city controls along Monument Avenue. Mr. Stoney said he would introduce the bill on July 1, when a new state law goes into effect giving local governments the authority to remove the monuments on their own.

“Richmond is no longer the capital of the Confederacy — it is filled with diversity and love for all — and we need to demonstrate that,” Mr. Stoney said in a statement.

On Thursday, Mr. Stoney called Davis “a racist & traitor who fled our city as his troops carried out orders to burn it to the ground.” 

“He never deserved to be up on that pedestal,” the mayor tweeted, vowing that the city would take steps to remove other statues soon. 

The Richmond Police did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment late Wednesday night.

In 2018, a commission appointed by Mr. Stoney recommended that the Davis monument be removed and replaced with a new statue. “Of all the statues, this one is most unabashedly Lost Cause in its design and sentiment,” the commissioners wrote. They also noted that Davis was not from Richmond or Virginia.

The sculpture was unveiled on June 3, 1907, and depicted Davis giving the speech in which he resigned from the United States Senate, according to the commission. On a column behind Davis sat an allegorical figure, Vindicatrix, based on the word vindicate, which reinforced the mythology of the Lost Cause, the commission said.

The statue came down amid a national reckoning over racist imagery and emblems fueled by the protests that have erupted after the death of Mr. Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis, who was killed after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.

Across the country, at least 10 monuments to Confederates or other controversial historical figures have been removed, and people have challenged similar monuments in more than 20 cities.

Last week, Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia said he planned to order that the Robert E. Lee statue on Monument Avenue be removed. An administration official said the Lee monument was the only Confederate statue in Richmond over which the state had control.

Just hours before the Davis monument was taken down on Wednesday, NASCAR announced that it would ban the Confederate battle flag from its events and properties.

Last Friday, the Marine Corps issued detailed directives about removing and banning public displays of the Confederate battle flag at its installations. And the mayor of Birmingham, Ala., last week ordered the removal of a Confederate statue from a public park

In Richmond this month, graffiti was scrawled on the headquarters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, and the building also burned for a time. Statues of the Confederate generals J.E.B. Stuart, Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee, all of which stand on the city’s Monument Avenue, were marked.

On Tuesday evening, a statue of Christopher Columbus was torn down and tossed into a lake in a Richmond city park where protesters had gathered for a demonstration in support of Indigenous peoples.

“We stand in solidarity with black and brown communities that are tired of being murdered by an out-of-control, militarized and violent police force,” the Richmond Indigenous Society, which took part in the rally, said in a statement on Wednesday."
Merriam-Webster Revises ‘Racism’ Entry After Missouri Woman Asks for Changes,"Merriam-Webster is revising its entry on racism after a recent college graduate in Missouri, inspired by the protests and debates about what it means to be racist, urged editors to make changes.

Currently, the dictionary’s entry contains three sections. The first defines racism as “a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race.”

The second calls it a “doctrine or political program based on the assumption of racism and designed to execute its principles” and “a political or social system founded on racism.” The third section refers to “racial prejudice or discrimination.”

Peter Sokolowski, an editor at large at Merriam-Webster, said in an interview Wednesday that editors were working to revise the online entry for racism after the recent graduate, Kennedy Mitchum, wrote a series of emails stating her case.

“This entry has not been revised in decades,” he said, adding that it was not a new division of the word’s meanings, “but an improvement of the wording.”

As a student at Drake University in Des Moines, Ms. Mitchum had noticed in discussions about racism that white people sometimes defended their arguments by cutting and pasting the definition from the dictionary.

So in late May, as protests against racism and police violence grew, Ms. Mitchum, 22, wrote to the editors at Merriam-Webster to argue that the entry should be revised to better reflect how systemic racism was in society.

“Racism is not only prejudice against a certain race due to the color of a persons skin, as it states in your dictionary,” she wrote. “It is both prejudice combined with social and institutional power. It is a system of advantage based on skin color.”

The next day, she got a reply.

Alex Chambers, an editor at the dictionary, said that he and his colleagues revise definitions or add new ones “when we see large-scale changes happening in the language.”

“The usage of racism to specifically describe the intersection of race-based prejudice with social and institutional oppression is becoming more and more common among English users,” he wrote.

After several more exchanges, in which Ms. Mitchum questioned whether their sources reflected a diverse society, Mr. Chambers confirmed that the dictionary would revise the entry after the editorial staff discussed it and agreed more nuance was needed. Ms. Mitchum’s exchange with the editor at the dictionary was reported by KMOV-TV on June 8.

Mr. Chambers said they are also planning to revise the entries of other words that are related to racism or have racial connotations.

“While our focus will always be on faithfully reflecting the real-world usage of a word, not on promoting any particular viewpoint, we have concluded that omitting any mention of the systemic aspects of racism promotes a certain viewpoint in itself,” he said. “It also does a disservice to readers of all races.”

Mr. Sokolowski said the revision will sharpen the language in the second section to better illustrate the ways racism can be systemic, and to include some examples. The point, he said, was to make the entry’s wording less “opaque.”

“We will make the idea of systemic or institutional racism even more explicit in the wording of the definition,” he said. One way to do that, he said, would be to use more examples, such as describing the system of apartheid in South Africa. (Because of space issues, he said, the print entry will probably not have as many examples.)

The systemic elements of racism have become a central point of the protests that have spread throughout the country after the May 25 killing of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minnesota. Increasingly, policymakers are re-examining demands to dismantle institutional barriers and policies, and public support for the Black Lives Matter movement has sharply risen. 

“People are looking up this word every single day,” Mr. Sokolowski said. “These are words that are very abstract, and therefore as ideas are very hard to put into words and that is one reason people go to the dictionary.”

Ms. Mitchum, who lives in Florissant, Mo., and graduated on May 16, got a taste of the inadequacies of abstraction as a freshman in 2016, when race and racism were central issues of the election year.

She got into a debate with one writer on social media who denied being racist by cutting and pasting only the first section of the Merriam-Webster definition as a defense, an omission that Ms. Mitchum believed disproved their point.

“I had to explain myself — that is not all there is to racism,” she said in an interview on Wednesday. “There is a system, and then there is individual bias. There are structures that perpetuate racism and then people who give in to that system. These two things should go hand in hand.”

The dictionary argument happened again this year, when a white classmate argued with Ms. Mitchum’s take on racism in the United States. Ms. Mitchum, an N.A.A.C.P. activist at the university, said the classmate also copied and pasted only the first section of the Merriam-Webster entry without recognizing the second part and its wider implications in society.

“They use that as a way to be ignorant” about racism in all its forms, such as microaggressions, Ms. Mitchum said. “People are programmed to think a certain way. They are not shown the whole picture in a few places.”

Mr. Sokolowski said that public requests for revisions often coincide with the national discourse. The marriage entry no longer contains references to gender, for example. “Activism doesn’t change the dictionary,” he said. “Activism changes the language.”"
George Floyd’s Brother Pleads With Congress: ‘Make It Stop’,"WASHINGTON — Philonise Floyd, whose brother’s death in police custody has inspired two weeks of sprawling protests across the country, made an impassioned plea to Congress on Wednesday to enact sweeping changes to law enforcement in America to address police brutality and systemic racism.

In wrenching testimony on Capitol Hill, Mr. Floyd described to the House Judiciary Committee the agony he felt as he watched the video of George Floyd, his older brother, dying while pinned under the knee of a white police officer for nearly nine minutes, gasping that he could not breathe. The elder Mr. Floyd was arrested over a complaint that he had bought cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill.

“I am asking you, is that what a black man’s life is worth? Twenty dollars?” Mr. Floyd asked. “This is 2020. Enough is enough. The people marching in the streets are telling you enough is enough.”

Mr. Floyd was the first witness and marquee voice among more than a half-dozen civil rights experts and activists at a hearing called to consider the most expansive federal intervention into law enforcement that lawmakers have proposed in recent memory, which was put forth by Democrats this week. His remarks came a day after his brother was laid to rest in Houston, amid a groundswell of public support for the Black Lives Matter movement, widespread protests that have convulsed big cities and small towns alike, and a rapidly unfolding national conversation on race in the United States.

“Sitting here, coming to try to tell you all about how I want justice for my brother, I just think about that video over and over again,” Mr. Floyd said in tears.

What happened to his brother, he said, was “a modern-day lynching in broad daylight.”

His testimony added to the mounting sense of urgency on Capitol Hill to overhaul law enforcement practices and address systemic racism in policing. House Democrats have indicated that they intend to act quickly, with a vote on their legislation planned by the end of the month. Congressional Republicans, faced with a rapid shift in public opinion, are scrambling to coalesce around a legislative response.

Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the committee, opened the hearing with the words “I can’t breathe,” quoting the phrase uttered by Mr. Floyd and other black men who have died in police custody.

“The nation is demanding that we enact meaningful change,” Mr. Nadler said. He called for Congress to institute a new paradigm for law enforcement that he described as “a guardian — not warrior — model of policing.”

The Democrats’ bill proposes significant changes to the rules that govern how police officers operate and how they can be held accountable for wrongdoing, and would make it easier to identify, track and prosecute police misconduct. It would curtail protections that shield officers accused of misconduct from being prosecuted, ban chokeholds and other neck-pressure tactics like the one used on Mr. Floyd, and mandate that law enforcement officers use deadly force only as a last resort.

The hearing, which stretched through the day, was punctuated by bursts of emotion, as Mr. Floyd detailed the pain his family has felt since his death. Representative Lucy McBath, a black Democrat from Georgia, whose son, Jordan, was shot and killed by a white man after he refused to turn down his rap music at a gas station tearfully replied, “I know your pain.”

Tracing a connection between her own loss, the death of Mr. Floyd, and the death of Ahmaud Arbery, who was fatally shot after armed white residents chased him during a run, Ms. McBath described the continued violence against black men as “a sucker punch in my heart and my gut.”

“I pray every single day for our nation,” Ms. McBath said. “I pray every single day for every family, and I pray that today, we finally do something about it.”

Republicans on the panel said they agreed that the nation’s policing needed to be overhauled, and Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the panel said the public was hungering for “a real discussion, real debate and real solutions about the police treatment of African-Americans.” But they spent much of their time condemning activists calling for defunding the police, a proposal not included in the Democrats’ bill.

And many of them appeared to take issue with the animating idea behind the protests and the Democratic legislation — that there is systemic racism in law enforcement — instead arguing that the problem was “bad apples” in police departments, as Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader, and several other Republicans put it.

“From where we sit right now, we believe the most actionable reforms must focus on three core concepts: simple transparency, training and termination of those rare bad apples in law enforcement,” said Mr. McCarthy, who is not a member of the committee but made a point of appearing to introduce Angela Jacobs Underwood, one of the Republican witnesses.

There were some glimmers of bipartisan agreement. Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, and a close ally of President Trump, approvingly singled out measures in the Democratic package that would ban the use of chokeholds and make lynching a federal hate crime.

“You can count on Republican cooperation as we hone these ideas and hopefully pass them and get them to the president’s desk,” Mr. Gaetz told Democrats.

Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin and a former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, endorsed the proposal in Democrats’ legislation to create a national registry of police misconduct. He also denounced police unions, accusing them of protecting “bad cops,” and saying they would need to “step up to the plate” in rooting out their own bad actors.

“I would hope that as this debate goes on we have speedier resolutions of getting rid of bad cops,” Mr. Sensenbrenner said. “I see nothing wrong with having a bad cop database, but having a database isn’t going to get somebody fired who ought to be fired.”

Still, Republicans and the witnesses they invited did not dwell on specific elements of the bill, and focused mostly on defending law enforcement. Mr. Jordan equated Mr. Floyd’s death with that of Dave Underwood, a federal officer who was killed in the line of duty during protests last month in Oakland, Calif., calling both deaths “as wrong as wrong can be.”

After Mr. Floyd testified, Republicans called Angela Jacobs Underwood, Mr. Underwood’s sister.

Congressional Democrats’ legislation would not defund or otherwise dismantle police departments, though it would condition some federal grants on adoption of anti-discrimination measures and other practices meant to prevent the excessive use of force. But Representative Karen Bass, Democrat of California and the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, a key sponsor of the bill, told reporters she found Republicans’ focus on the defund movement on Wednesday to be an encouraging sign.

“They’re talking about defunding the police — fine,” Ms. Bass said. “That doesn’t have anything to do with what we’re doing. So that makes me feel a little hopeful.”

After delivering his testimony on Capitol Hill, Mr. Floyd visited Black Lives Matter Plaza, the area in front of the White House where federal officials used chemical spray to clear demonstrators protesting police misconduct and his brother’s death. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington later directed city workers to paint the mantra in large yellow letters down the street.

Flanked by his lawyer, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, Democrat of Texas, and other protesters, Mr. Floyd raised his fist and shouted with them, “George Floyd matters.”

Twitter and Square Make Juneteenth a Company Holiday,"Twitter and Square on Tuesday designated Juneteenth, which celebrates the end of slavery in America, as a company holiday — the latest conciliatory overtures by major corporations since the widespread protests over police brutality and the death of George Floyd.

The initiative was announced on social media by Jack Dorsey, the chief executive and a founder of Twitter and Square, a mobile payment company. The announcement came on the same day as the funeral for Mr. Floyd, the black man who died last month after a Minneapolis police officer put his knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes.

Businesses large and small, from the National Football League to independent shops, have re-examined their policies and social responsibility to combat systemic racism in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.

The holiday got its name by combining the words June and nineteenth. On June 19, 1865, Union soldiers landing in Galveston, Texas, told the slaves there that they were free and that the Civil War had ended — more than two years after Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.

“Both Twitter and Square are making #Juneteenth (June 19th) a company holiday in the U.S., forevermore,” Mr. Dorsey wrote on Twitter. “A day for celebration, education, and connection.”

Forty-seven states recognize Juneteenth as a state holiday, but efforts to make it a national holiday have stalled in Congress. For many African-Americans, it is considered an independence day.

Noliwe Rooks, an author and professor at Cornell University whose work explores race and gender, said in an email Tuesday that this year’s observance had added meaning.

“As a holiday, Juneteenth perfectly encapsulates this moment which is almost equal parts anger over the reminders of how little regard there has generally been for Black life, health and freedom, and the totally unexpected reality that fundamental change has come,” Dr. Rooks said. “Like a shock, change has come.”

Dr. Rooks said that Juneteenth was relatively unknown outside of black people, scholars and those who are around black people. It was unusual for a corporation with a majority of white people to make it a company holiday, she said.

“Companies may choose to embrace the holiday as a way of saying they understand that Black life matters,” Dr. Rooks said, adding that “we will just have to look beyond the ease of their words today, and toward how concrete are their actions over the coming years in order to evaluate their sincerity.”

Vox Media also made Juneteenth a company holiday, a Wall Street Journal reporter said Tuesday. A journalist for Politico wrote on Twitter that employees had been given June 19 off this year, but said she didn’t know if it was in observance of Juneteenth.

Twitter and Square will designate company holidays overseas on other days commemorating emancipation, Mr. Dorsey tweeted.

Twitter did not respond to requests for further comment about how the initiative came about or how long it had been planned.

The social media company has come under intense scrutiny over its posting guidelines and drew the ire of President Trump in late May when it appended a note to one of his tweets threatening to have some protesters shot.

Mr. Trump tweeted “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” invoking a phrase used by Walter Headley, the Miami police chief, during the civil rights protests in 1967. Twitter labeled Mr. Trump’s posts as “glorifying violence,” prompting the president to threaten to regulate social media platforms.

A spokeswoman for Square said that Mr. Dorsey’s tweets spoke for themselves."
"Drawing on Decades of Activism, Karen Bass Leads Democrats’ Policing Overhaul","For Karen Bass, the riots that erupted in Los Angeles in 1992 after the acquittal of four white police officers caught on tape beating an unarmed black man, Rodney King, felt like a personal defeat. Having spent most of her life as an activist against police brutality and fighting violence in her community, seeing her neighborhood flare in fiery unrest made her wonder what years of work had accomplished.

“I just drove around feeling that all of the years of my involvement and all of the things I had tried to do had been a failure,” she recalled in 2011. “I failed the young people because they felt no outlet other than to destroy.”

Three decades later, with the nation once again convulsing over the brutal victimization, captured on video, of a black man by white police officers, Ms. Bass is witnessing an eerily familiar moment of national reckoning as she emerges as one of the most influential voices in a rapidly shifting debate over the future of policing in America. She is determined to ensure that this time the outrage is channeled into lasting change.

Ms. Bass, now a fifth-term congresswoman representing part of Los Angeles and the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, has taken the lead role in crafting the most thorough overhaul of American policing in recent memory — legislation that Democrats plan to move through the House by the end of June — aimed at preventing excessive use of force and addressing systemic racism. It would make it easier to track, prosecute and punish police misconduct, promote new officer anti-bias training and mandate that lethal force can be used only as a last resort. It would also ban the use of chokeholds and other neck-pressure tactics like the one used on George Floyd, the black Minneapolis man who died after an officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.

“It’s almost like the Scripture says: She’s come for such a time as this,” said Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, who met Ms. Bass in the 1980s when they were working on the same issues. “This is a moment that the country needs her leadership, and she certainly has stepped up.”

Ms. Bass, 66, has been many things in her life: a middle school activist, an emergency room physician assistant and a brown belt in taekwondo — not to mention the first black female speaker of any state legislature in the country, in California.

Unlike the other lead authors of the bill — Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, who both sought the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the Judiciary Committee chairman — she does not have much of a national profile.

But when the news of Mr. Floyd’s death prompted protests across the country and trained the nation’s focus on policing, there was no question that Ms. Bass would lead the way for Democrats. Not only was she the chairwoman of the 50-plus-member Black Caucus and the House’s subcommittee on crime and terrorism, but she was also one of the few lawmakers in Congress with the background and the authority to hold together a fragile coalition of elected Democrats, civil rights groups and protesters on the streets demanding change.

“She comes through it all with the greatest gentility and strength,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a fellow Californian, said in an interview.

Still, it has been a tricky endeavor.

Ms. Bass has had to pull along moderate white colleagues, for whom support of the police has been a political imperative, scheduling conference calls with the Blue Dogs and other centrist groups to ensure they understand the measure and can embrace it. She also toiled to persuade prominent civil rights groups, who wanted a bill that would be tough on the police, to accept the package.

A letter with some 400 signatures from the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights laid out eight demands — all of them measures to hold officers accountable or ban certain uses of force. Later, they insisted that no new funds be sent to departments, according to senior aides who helped draft the bill, a condition that Democrats embraced. Even so, they held off on offering public support for the bill. Ms. Bass worked the phones until they agreed to do so at the 11th hour.

All the while, Ms. Bass was keenly aware that the legislation could collapse if Democrats allowed it to be lumped with growing calls to defund and dismantle police departments, as President Trump and leading Republicans repeatedly try to falsely paint all Democrats as espousing that approach. She insisted that the bill also include programs and proposals to incentivize departments to get better.

“‘Defund the police’ became a slogan in the last few days,” she said in an interview. “Nobody was even thinking about that when we were putting the bill together.”

There have been missteps along the way. It was Ms. Bass who hatched the idea for Democratic leaders, including several who are white, to don colorful African kente-cloth stoles on Monday at a news conference to unveil the bill, a spectacle that was roundly mocked and derided as an example of cultural appropriation.

Ms. Bass had thought the gesture would show solidarity and inclusion, summoning the 400-year history of mistreatment of black people by white Americans, aides said. But instead, the episode briefly overshadowed the measure itself. Democratic officials despaired privately, but Ms. Bass urged them to just move on, they said privately, arguing that the work ahead was more important.

For Ms. Bass, who as a younger woman was repeatedly harassed by the police herself for speaking out, the memory of 1992 serves as a reminder not only of how long black Americans have been fighting against state-sanctioned violence by the police, but also of the power of tragedy to galvanize change in America.

“The best change takes place with outside pressure on the kind of issues I work on,” Ms. Bass said. “It’s not like the issues I work on have 10 legal firms and lobbyists and all that. If you don’t have wealth, you have people. The thousands of people out protesting are moving Congress to act.”

Ms. Bass has been an activist since long before she was even able to vote.

She grew up in Los Angeles during the civil rights movement, the daughter of a letter carrier. When she was in middle school, she committed her mother to be a precinct captain for Robert F. Kennedy’s presidential campaign in California, and then did all the work herself. In high school, when her own teachers were on strike, she rode her bicycle to U.C.L.A. to sit in on classes with Angela Davis, the philosopher and activist who became a symbol of the Black Power movement.

At a hearing on the bill on Wednesday, she noted that she had begun protesting police violence the same year that Mr. Floyd was born, in 1973. She also recalled Daryl Gates, the onetime chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, calling a news conference to claim that the reason so many black people were dying of chokeholds in police custody was “because our neck veins were different.”

Ms. Bass worked as an emergency room physician assistant during the early years of the AIDS crisis — a time she remembers as eerily similar to the coronavirus pandemic — and as the crack cocaine epidemic was ravaging Los Angeles and other black communities across the country. Moved by the decimation, she helped found Community Coalition, a nonprofit based in South Los Angeles that canvassed the neighborhood in search of solutions to the drug epidemic and the violence it caused.

In 2004, she left the group and made her first foray into elected politics, winning a seat in the California Assembly. She was elected speaker in the spring of 2008. But an agenda that included strengthening welfare programs for children quickly gave way to the most pressing financial crisis in California’s modern history. As the economy rapidly contracted and the state faced mounting losses, Ms. Bass worked with Arnold Schwarzenegger, then the Republican governor, to close a yawning deficit with unpopular spending cuts to Democratic priorities and new taxes that Republicans had vowed never to support.

She was elected to Congress in 2010.

The push to draft the policing legislation, the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, was a frantic two-week sprint. Ms. Bass oversaw it, communicating sometimes late into the night across a three-hour time difference from her home in Los Angeles to staff members back in Washington.

It helped that the Black Caucus had become over the years a sort of brain trust for policing proposals meant to begin unwinding the long-term effects of systemic racism. As lawmakers pieced together the measure, they were pulling DNA from bills going back decades, some written by pioneering black lawmakers, now dead, who never could have contemplated the House actually taking them up.

With the presidential election looming, Ms. Bass had intended to use 2020 to demand a fair census and voting rights, declaring it a year of “existential threats to the black community.” Then came Covid-19, which Ms. Bass has spent months pointing out has disproportionately killed people of color. But it was the death of Mr. Floyd on Memorial Day — captured in a video that quickly went viral and inspired widespread outrage — that has fueled her current assignment.

“That was a slow, torturous murder, and the whole world saw it,” Ms. Bass said. “I think it was just one murder too many.”"
Trump Rejects Renaming Military Bases Named After Confederate Generals,"President Trump responded to waves of demonstrations for racial justice on Wednesday by picking a fight over the legacy of the Confederacy, further inflaming the nation’s culture war at a time when tensions were already high after the killing of George Floyd and widespread street protests against police brutality.

On the same day that Mr. Floyd’s brother pleaded with Congress to tackle racism in the United States, Mr. Trump publicly slapped down the Pentagon for considering renaming Army bases named after Confederate officers who fought against the Union during the Civil War. The White House said the president would go so far as to refuse to sign the annual defense authorization bill if Congress tried to force his hand.

In speaking out on behalf of Confederate base names, the president positioned himself even more firmly against the growing movement for change that has emerged since Mr. Floyd’s death in the custody of a white Minneapolis police officer who pressed a knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes. While Mr. Trump has denounced the killing, he has emphasized a law-and-order, pro-police message appealing to his hard-core base and dismissed complaints of systemic racism.

But he has appeared to be tacking against the popular tide as polls showed wide public support for protesters in the streets, and as various institutions in society have scrambled to demonstrate solidarity with the broader aims of the demonstrations. Even some sectors of American life that Mr. Trump has catered to were breaking the other direction.

Only two hours after his defense of Confederate base names, NASCAR announced that it would ban Confederate flags from its races. The N.F.L. has already reversed itself to embrace kneeling players protesting racism.

At the Capitol, Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for the removal of 11 remaining statues of Confederate figures, including Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee, days after Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia vowed to remove the statue of Lee from the storied Monument Avenue in Richmond, the onetime Confederate capital. Other similar symbols were being removed elsewhere in the country.

Mr. Trump stretched credulity again on Wednesday in insisting that he has done more for African-Americans than virtually any other president, citing financial support for historically black colleges and universities and legislation to overhaul criminal sentencing. He invited in cameras to record him meeting with a half-dozen black advisers and supporters, mainly, it seemed, to have them echo his complaints that he was not being treated fairly by the news media.

But the president expressed no sympathy for the idea of renaming the 10 Army bases that honor Confederate generals who were traitors to the United States and fought against the American military to defend the slaveholding South. Among them are Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Fort Hood in Texas and Fort Benning in Georgia.

“The United States of America trained and deployed our HEROES on these Hallowed Grounds, and won two World Wars,” Mr. Trump wrote in a string of Twitter messages. “Therefore, my Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations. Our history as the Greatest Nation in the World will not be tampered with. Respect our Military!”

But the president’s outburst infuriated senior officials at the Pentagon at a time when the commander in chief and his top military leaders have already been clashing over how to respond to the street protests.

Mr. Trump wanted to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807 to send active-duty troops into the cities to take on looters and rioters, only to run into heated and eventually public resistance from Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

With that rift still unhealed, Mr. Esper and General Milley were anxious to show understanding of the public anger that has also manifested itself among those in uniform. They held meetings on Tuesday to discuss the gap in the military between its mostly white officer corps and its diverse enlisted ranks, where 43 percent are people of color.

Mr. Esper and General Milley discussed coming up with what officials called a “comprehensive plan” to address Army base names, Confederate symbols on military installations and the alienation that many service members who are people of color say they have come to feel in a military where most of their senior leaders are white men.

One Defense Department official, who like others insisted on anonymity to discuss internal affairs, said the conversation went beyond just the base names and that the senior officials talked about ways to unify white and black service members on issues that have been divisive.

But Mr. Trump grew upset when he saw articles about the possibility of renaming bases, according to two administration officials. Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, encouraged the president to block any attempt to change the names, the officials said.

Mr. Trump opted to make a public show of overruling the Pentagon, and preparations were made to amplify his tweets once he posted them. The scheduled briefing by Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, was delayed about 50 minutes until the tweets went online, and White House staff members handed out printouts of the posts to reporters as the briefing began.

From the lectern, Ms. McEnany said renaming the bases would be “an insult” to the troops who served there and then were sent off to combat zones overseas. “To tell them that what they left was inherently a racist institution because of a name, that’s unacceptable to the president, and rightfully so,” she said.

She added that Mr. Trump would not compromise with lawmakers on the matter. “The president will not be signing legislation that renames America’s forts,” she said.

Leaning into the argument, Ms. McEnany then expanded on the point, criticizing HBO Max for announcing this week that it has temporarily removed “Gone With the Wind” from its catalog over concerns about the film’s romanticization of the slaveholding South.

“Where do you draw the line here?” Ms. McEnany asked.

Picking up an argument that Mr. Trump has made, she suggested that revered figures like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Franklin D. Roosevelt could be “erased from history” next. She then took it another step by suggesting that a highway truck stop named after former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, could be renamed because, by his own admission, he worked with segregationist lawmakers when he first arrived in the Senate, and they were powers in the Democratic caucus.

Mr. Trump, a native of New York who avoided military service during the Vietnam War citing bone spurs in his foot, has aligned himself repeatedly with Southern defenders of Confederate heritage, most notably during a rally in 2017 in Charlottesville, Va., that attracted white supremacists and turned violent.

Among those who say it is time to change the base names is Gen. David H. Petraeus, the retired Army commander in Iraq and Afghanistan who served at Fort Bragg three times.

“The irony of training at bases named for those who took up arms against the United States, and for the right to enslave others, is inescapable to anyone paying attention,” he wrote in The Atlantic on Tuesday. “Now, belatedly, is the moment for us to pay such attention.”

Maj. Gen. Paul D. Eaton, another retired officer and former commander at Fort Benning, criticized Mr. Trump for his refusal to consider name changes. “Rather than move this nation further away from institutionalized racism, he believes we should cling to it and its heritage by keeping the names of racist traitors on the gates of our military bases,” Mr. Eaton said.

The call by Ms. Pelosi, Democrat of California, to remove the remaining Confederate statues from the Capitol will force lawmakers to consider their own home.

“While I believe it is imperative that we never forget our history lest we repeat it, I also believe that there is no room for celebrating the violent bigotry of the men of the Confederacy in the hallowed halls of the United States Capitol or in places of honor across the country,” Ms. Pelosi wrote in a letter to the top lawmakers on the Joint Committee on the Library, which oversees the statue collection.

Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, the top Democrat on the committee, immediately endorsed Ms. Pelosi’s proposal, saying in a statement that officials “should expediently remove these symbols of cruelty and bigotry from the halls of the Capitol.”

Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, the top Republican on the panel, said it was “encouraging” that some of the states had begun to switch the statues that they contribute to the Capitol but noted in a statement that “as Speaker Pelosi is undoubtedly aware, the law does not permit the architect of the Capitol or the Joint Committee of Congress on the Library to remove a statue from the Capitol once it has been received.”

During her first tenure as speaker, from 2007 to 2011, Ms. Pelosi oversaw the relocation of Lee’s statue from a prominent position in National Statuary Hall to the Capitol’s crypt. Congress has allowed states to provide two statues for display in the Capitol since 1864, and in 2000, approved new legislation that would allow states to swap an old sculpture out.

But if Mr. Trump may not see Lee’s figure at the Capitol if the speaker’s plan is approved, he will find another likeness of the Confederate general on Saturday when he visits the United States Military Academy at West Point to deliver the commencement address.

Lee, a West Point graduate and later its superintendent, is honored throughout the academy. His name adorns a gate, a road and a barracks, not counting portraits of him hanging on the walls.

Texas Inmate Who Spent Nearly 40 Years on Death Row Is Granted Parole,"A Texas inmate who spent nearly 40 years on death row and was at the center of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that exempts people with intellectual disabilities from being executed was granted parole on Monday.

The inmate, Bobby Moore, had been sentenced to death in 1980 in the killing of a supermarket clerk during a robbery in Houston.

But last year, the Supreme Court ruled that Mr. Moore was intellectually disabled after rejecting the state’s methodology for diagnosing intellectual disabilities. The nation’s top court said that the standards used by the state relied too heavily on I.Q. scores and took account of factors rooted in stereotypes.

A Texas appeals court then resentenced Mr. Moore to life in prison in November, making him eligible for parole.

And on Monday, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted in favor of releasing Mr. Moore, 60, who is African-American. The board’s decision was sent in an email by David Gutiérrez, the board’s presiding officer, to a group of state lawmakers.

“I would like to thank each of you for bringing attention to Mr. Moore’s plight to the board,” Mr. Gutiérrez wrote.

In March, more than 20 state lawmakers wrote a letter to the state parole board that sought the release of Mr. Moore. The lawmakers are part of a recently formed Criminal Justice Reform Caucus in the Legislature.

State Representative Joe Moody, a Democrat from El Paso and co-chairman of the caucus, wrote on Twitter on Monday that the parole board’s decision was “a breath of hope during a very difficult national conversation.”

He was referring to the nationwide protests over the killing of George Floyd, the unarmed black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer put his knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes on May 25 while he was handcuffed on the ground.

Kim Ogg, a Democrat who is the district attorney of Harris County, which includes Houston, had shared the view of the Supreme Court.

“We supported his resentencing to a life sentence instead of death,” Dane Schiller, a spokesman for Ms. Ogg, wrote in an email on Monday night. “We agree with the U.S. Supreme Court that the intellectually disabled cannot be executed, no matter how heinous the crime. His parole is a matter exclusively in the hands of the state’s parole board.”

A life sentence without the possibility of parole had not been enacted in Texas when Mr. Moore was sentenced to death in 1980. That made him eligible for parole. His release date has not been set.

Mr. Moore is not the first inmate on death row to have the terms of his sentence changed on account of mental ability. In 2002, the Supreme Court ruled that Daryl Atkins, a Virginia man who had been convicted of murder, was intellectually disabled and said that executing him would have violated an Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment.

In 2008, Mr. Atkins was resentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole."
"Houston Bids Goodbye to George Floyd, Whose Killing Galvanized a Movement","HOUSTON — George Floyd died at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis. A thousand miles to the south, in the Texas city where he was raised, two rows of police officers saluted as his coffin went past.

Hours before Mr. Floyd’s funeral began at a southwest Houston church, uniformed officers stood between the hearse and the front doors. As relatives and friends pushed the gold coffin with blue trimming into the church, the officers raised their hands in a show of respect.

Mr. Floyd’s funeral and the public viewing that preceded it a day earlier have been a counterpoint to the fury that his death touched off in cities across America. Mr. Floyd, who grew up in a tough public housing complex in Houston’s predominantly black Third Ward, was considered a native son, and the tone adopted by protesters, activists, elected officials and police officers has been one of honoring a grieving Houston family.

Inside the Fountain of Praise church, Mr. Floyd, 46, the emblem of an international movement whose name has been chanted by thousands of people since his death, was remembered as the son, brother, uncle and father that he was in life.

transcript

[singing] “George Floyd, lovingly known as ‘Big Floyd’ and the ‘Gentle Giant,’ was steadfast in his kindness and devotion to helping his fellow Jack Yates Lions succeed through his genuine example of love, faith and generosity.” “The world knows George Floyd. I know Perry Jr. — he was a pesky little rascal, but we all loved him. And I just want to thank all the mothers that are here today. And if you’ve got a nephew, an uncle, just hug them and just let them know we are for all these young black men that are coming up in this world today. And just hug them and love them because we don’t ever know.” Singing: “The good times that made us laugh, outweigh the bad.” “Your children will be honored to witness your contributions firsthand. You didn’t make excuses, but stood tall and accepted your responsibilities like a real man.” “We must commit to this family — all of his family, all five of his children, grandchildren and all — that until these people pay for what they did, that we’re going to be there with them. Because lives like George will not matter until somebody pays the cost for taking their lives. The problem is too many of you been walking by the Eric Garners, been walking by the Trayvon Martins, been walking by the Arberys, been walking by — and now we stopped for George Floyd. And I’m in Houston today because I don’t want nobody to call me a passer-by.”

George Perry Floyd Jr. was born in North Carolina but grew up in the Cuney Homes housing complex in Houston. He was a 1993 graduate of Jack Yates High School, where he played on the basketball team as a 6-foot-6 power forward “able to dunk with both hands.” And he was a father of five and grandfather of two, according to the funeral program.

His relatives referred to him as “Superman.”

“The world knows George Floyd,” said Kathleen McGee, one of his aunts, surrounded by relatives, all dressed in white. “I know him as Perry Jr. He was a pesky little rascal, but we all loved him.”

transcript

My name is Jonathan Veal. I have known George Floyd since the sixth grade at James D. Ryan Middle School in the community of Third Ward, which is located in Houston, Texas. The first day I saw him, I was in the cafeteria, and he came in. And I was just blown away by his height. He was 6’2“, and I was just in awe, just like wow, that’s a tall guy. And he was just tall and skinny. This guy is in the sixth grade? And that was the beginning of our relationship. I remember it was the last day of school in our junior year, and there was this place just north of our school, maybe three blocks, that we called The Hill. And we would just kind of go there just to hang out. And for some reason, the conversation shifted to OK, we’re about to graduate. It was like we’re no longer going to be teenagers anymore. So I know I talked about just wanting to get married, and George talked about college. And all of a sudden he made this statement. He says, man, I want to be big. I want to touch the world.



Most of us had not seen the world outside of, you know, Third Ward or the Houston community so it was just like, oh. Wow. OK.

He was just a fun person to be around. There was never a dull moment. Never a dull moment.

Me and Big George used to go to school all the time. And he’d get out and listen to music and talk about, you know, about the music world, and how he want to do this and do that, and just be successful.

We were young, just kids. We trying to figure this thing out, you know? It’s when you’re in your 20s, your early 20s and you’re trying to figure out — you’re trying to see what direction you’re going to go in, just waking up and just trying to figure it out.

I met Floyd seven to 10 years ago while I was trying to plant a church, Resurrection Houston’s Ministry, in the middle of Third Ward Houston, Texas, in the Cuney Homes Housing Project. And say I go to a neighborhood, I can knock on 50 doors. 50 people may come out. Floyd comes out the door, 100 people come out. Everybody knows him. He’s connected. Man, just to see his impact was amazing, his road to redemption. And then how God used him in this season and in this moment.



Soon as he come in the door, he asks you, are you good? You all right? Always. And he would say — he always said things twice sometimes. He always called me Al-Al, and he called Teresa T-T. He just — that’s just him. Every time we cooked him a meal, gave him a plate, he’d come down rubbing his tummy and just go, “thank you, thank you, thank you.” You know what I mean? And he always said this for the whole time that Teresa and me and him lived here together. He always would tell us, “I want y’all to know I appreciate you.” He always would tell us that.

After I learned that this was my friend, just a flood of emotions came about. I didn’t sleep the next couple of nights just thinking about what happened. And then that’s when it became global. And then I was like, wow, it’s literally happening. He’s touching the world. He’s touching the world. I was just like, wow.

From The New York Times, I’m Caitlin Dickerson. This is “The Daily.” Today: George Floyd’s funeral. My colleague Manny Fernandez was in Houston. It’s Wednesday, June 10.



Hi, guys.

Hey, Manny. It’s Caitlin.

How you doing?

I’m OK. How are you and where are you?

I am in the parking lot of the Fountain of Praise Church in Southwest Houston, where George Floyd’s funeral was just held.

And what was today about?

So today was about two different things — and you saw this during the service itself, and then I got this sense from talking to people outside. On the one hand, there was a lot of people who wanted to talk about George Floyd as a symbol of a movement, and George Floyd’s death not being in vain. And yet on the other hand, a lot of people were trying to say, hold on, wait, let’s talk about him as a man. And let’s kind of talk about the jokes he used to crack, and the pranks he used to pull, and what he was like in the projects of Houston where he’s from. And so I think that there was that two-sided story that you kind of heard today. Let’s remember the man who’s become this symbol, and let’s also just remember the man himself.

And this is a familiar dynamic for you, right? I mean, you’ve covered funerals for other people who’ve died at the hands of police, and you’ve seen this dynamic before.

Yeah, absolutely. It reminded me of 2014 with Michael Brown’s funeral, when people gather around, and they say, give us a little bit of space in this social justice movement that’s popping up around this person’s death. Give us a few hours in a day to talk about them and their flaws, right? And to sort of talk about them as a full human before their life becomes more myth than reality. And I think that the people here at the funeral tried to sort of hold onto that space as long as they can before the train has left the station.

And you heard some of that today, but you’ve also been reporting for the last few weeks on George Floyd, who he was. So what have you learned about his life?

I spent a lot of time at the place where he’s from. And he’s from a place called the Bricks. And the Bricks are a nickname for the Cuney Homes Public Housing Project in Houston. And he grew up in the Cuney Homes in the ‘80s, in the ‘90s and the early 2000s. And it’s a hard world. But by all accounts, he’s a pretty happy kid. George’s mother was sort of a matron of the Cuney Homes. She was raising her kids. She was raising George. And at the same time, she started raising her own grandchildren for a time, and she started raising some of the neighbor’s children. And she fed them, they spent the night at her apartment. And that’s who Miss Cissy was. That’s who George Floyd’s mother was, a mother to a lot of Cuney Homes.

So what happens once George moves into high school and then adulthood?

So George Floyd goes to high school just down the street from Cuney Homes. He goes to Jack Yates High School. He’s a big kid. Eventually he grows to 6’6“, and he kind of immediately becomes a star basketball player and a star football player. He helps take the football team to state shampionships in 1992, and he is so good that he gets a basketball scholarship to go to college in South Florida. And he goes there, and he plays a little bit of basketball. It doesn’t work out. He transfers back to Texas. He goes to the Kingsville campus of Texas A&M University, and he goes there for a couple years. Meanwhile, he’s going back and forth to Houston, back and forth to the Third Ward. And as he’s doing that, he meets this legendary producer named DJ Screw —

[MUSIC]:

— who eventually becomes sort of a legend in Houston rap circles.

(SINGING) Hey. Hey!

And there was a time in the early ‘90s when DJ Screw made a bunch of mix tapes.

(RAPPING) Welcome, y’all to the fabulous Carolina West. I own this [EXPLETIVE].

And DJ Screw is rapping on these tapes, but he also invites other rappers to come in. And a lot of these rappers are just kids from the neighborhood —

(RAPPING) Man, it’s going down. Know what I’m saying?

— while George Floyd is one of those guys rapping on DJ Screw’s mixtape.

(RAPPING) Know what I’m saying? Big Floyd representing [INAUDIBLE].

And he calls himself Big Floyd.

(RAPPING) — going down like a [EXPLETIVE], know what I’m saying? Watch me crawl low on my [EXPLETIVE] spiders. Welcome to the ghetto. It’s Third Ward, Texas. Boys shopping blades on they [EXPLETIVE] mixes. Boys in —

And then meanwhile, he’s still in college. He’s going to Texas A&M Kingsville. And it doesn’t work out. He pulls out of Texas A&M, he never gets his degree and he goes back to Cuney Homes. And that’s when his life sort of takes another turn. And it’s in 1997 that he gets his first run-in with law enforcement. And so for about a decade of his life, from the age of 23 in 1997, to when he was 34 in 2008, he had a string of arrests in Houston. Some of the arrests were felonies. Some of them were misdemeanors. He was arrested for drugs and for robbery, and a few other charges. His most serious case comes in 2008. He’s arrested for his role in a home invasion robbery, according to court documents. And so he pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. He’s sentenced to five years in state prison. He only serves four years, and he’s released in 2013. And after he’s released from prison, he really starts to turn his life around. He becomes more religious. George Floyd has a daughter who’s born around that time after he gets out of prison. And it turns out what we learned at the funeral is that he actually had five children and two grandchildren. And he starts reconnecting with his kids. He starts speaking out about and against gun violence. And he becomes almost this unofficial community leader back in the Cuney Homes, back in Third Ward, and he has a lot of respect out there. And then eventually, he gets plugged into this program that will eventually take him to Minneapolis.

We’ve been criticized for not writing about and publicizing more of the details of his criminal history. I think some people have this world view where if you’re an ex-con, then you’re an ex-con, and that’s all you’ll ever be in your life. And the people in the Cuney Homes, a lot of them have run-ins with law enforcement. But, you know, your life moves on after that, and people change. And so I think it’s sort of a balance to try to write about the totality of somebody’s life, the good and the bad, and try to do that in a way that honors the memory of a person whose reason for being in the news has to do with him being a victim of a crime and not the perpetrator of one.

So tell me about George Floyd’s final years and his final chapter.

He has a pretty quiet life in Minneapolis. He’s living with roommates. He’s working as a security guard at a nightclub. He has a girlfriend. He’s still very religious, reading the Bible. And he has this sort of quiet life. He called it his new chapter in Minneapolis. The people who knew him here in Houston say they thought he was pretty happy out there.



We’ll be right back.

So that’s George Floyd the person. And like you said, there’s also George Floyd the symbol and the beginning of a movement. So how did those two ideas of him play out during his funeral today?

Yeah.

Amen. Amen.

So the funeral is at a church in Houston called the Fountain of Praise. And the media wasn’t allowed inside. And so I spent most of the day outside talking to people.

Pastor Wright, we want to bring greetings to everyone who is within the sanctuary walls as well as those who are watching via stream or some platform today.

But it was live streamed.

[ORGAN PLAYING] In the tradition of the African-American church, this will be a home-going celebration. Come on. I want to say it again. This will be a home-going celebration of brother George Floyd tonight.

And here you had a number of elected officials, including many of the African-American political leaders in Houston and in Texas.

Let me just speak, briefly say — let me — on behalf of the city of Houston —

Mayor Turner of Houston spoke.

But as I speak right now, the city attorney is drafting an executive order.

And said that —

We will ban chokeholds and strangleholds.

— he wants to ban chokeholds in the Houston Police Department.

And I have a resolution that will be presented to the family.

You had Congressman Al Green come up.

This resolution is going to say to those who look through the vista of time that at this time, there lived one among us who was a child of God who was taken untimely. But we’re going to make sure that those who have look through time, that they will know that he made a difference within his time, because he changed not only this country, not only the United States, he changed the world. George Floyd changed the world.

And also —

Hello, everyone. On this day of prayer where we try to understand God’s plan and our pain —

— Joe Biden made a video message.

Now is the time for racial justice. That’s the answer we must give to our children when they ask, why? Because when there is justice for George Floyd, we will truly be on our way to racial justice in America.

And they all sort of talked about and told the family that his death would not be in vain.

God bless you all. God bless you all. [APPLAUSE]

I want to ask the members of the family who are going to come up and speak at this time, if you would please make your way to the stage.

And then after the first half of the funeral is sort of taken up by politicians —

Welcome, everyone. I am George Floyd’s aunt. And I just want to thank everybody, and I would like to thank the whole world, what it has done for my family today.

— the family sort of takes over.

But I just want to make this statement. The world knows George Floyd. I know Perry Jr. He was a pesky little rascal. [LAUGHS]

But we all loved him.

And they sort of physically take over, and they’re up there as a group.

(CRYING) I just want to say that I’m going to miss my brother a whole lot. And — [APPLAUSE]

I love him. I just want to say to him, I love you. And I thank God for giving me my own personal Superman. God bless you all.

And they start talking about their brother and their uncle.

Hello. My name is Brooke Williams, George Floyd’s niece. And I can breathe. As long as I’m breathing, justice will be served for Perry. First off, I want to thank all of you for coming out to support George Perry Floyd. My uncle was a father, brother, uncle and a cousin to many. Spiritually grounded, an activist, he always moved people with his words.

And it becomes very powerful to hear them talk in a very intimate way about their relatives.

My most favorite memory when my uncle was when he paid me to scratch his head. After long days of work, we arrived at home. We even created a song about it called “Scratch my head, scratch my head, yeah!” [LAUGHS]

But after that, I knew he was a comedian. He always told me, baby girl, you’re going to go so far with that beautiful smile and brains of yours.”=

Well then fast forward to 1998, I started a college exhibition tour team touring around the country going to play different colleges and exhibition games. And Big Floyd, that was my first power forward. I would be calling around, trying to get contracts with the different schools, and the coaches would ask me, who’s your big man? And I would say, George Floyd. They’d say, oh, you got Big Floyd. OK, well your team must be pretty good. And so then we would go off and play.

And it was those little moments and those little anecdotes that really, I think, helped people get a sense of who George was.

Everybody know who Big Floyd is now. Third Ward, Cuney Homes —

As the family spoke —

From the Cuney Home to Jack Yates High —

— you really heard —

— from Third Ward and the Cuney Homes to come and join me.

— this sort of Third Ward pride come up.

— in Third Ward Cuney Home, Texas.

Very historic, black-elected officials live there. It’s home to the only black-owned banking institution in Texas. Beyonce is from the Third Ward. It’s just a place of a lot of black pride and a lot of black history. At the same time, it’s also a place of a lot of struggle and a lot of poverty. And there’s a real strong sense that George Floyd is from this place that is a hard-fought and very proud place.

[ORGAN PLAYING]

At the direction of Senior Pastor, Pastor Remus Wright —

And then —

— my privilege and my honor today —

— you have the final eulogy —

— a man who needs no introduction but deserves one.

— delivered by the Reverend Al Sharpton.

Al Sharpton. [APPLAUSE]

And he appears. He’s standing there in a black and white preacher’s robe.

I hear people talk about what happened to George Floyd like there was something less than a crime. This was not just a tragedy, it was a crime.

And to me, there was this one moment early on. He’s standing up there and then he puts his glasses on, and he starts reading from this list.

— I give him recognition. I must also recognize several families are here.

As if he’s going to thank some of the different people. And he starts talking about some of the people who are there, and he says —

The mother of Trayvon Martin, will you stand?

— “The mother of Trayvon Martin, will you stand?”

The mother —

“The mother of Eric Garner, will you stand?”

The mother of Eric Garner, will you stand?

And he runs through this long list. It’s like a roll call.

The sister of Botham Jean, will you stand?

And people are cheering.

The family of Pamela Turner right here in Houston, will you stand?

They are standing, the crowd is standing.

The father of Michael Brown from Ferguson, Missouri, will you stand?

Wow. They’re all there.

Yeah.

The father of Ahmaud Arbery, will you stand?

And to have all of them there at this funeral, they know the pain of this more than anyone. And they have the right to be angrier than everyone else. And yet, here they are grieving with George Floyd’s family. And you realize that George Floyd is part of this family of victims that should not be a family.

All of these families came to stand with this family, because they know better than anyone else the pain they will suffer from the loss that they have gone through.

So there was one moment when I think Sharpton pulled together these two strands of the man and the symbol of George Floyd.

God always uses unlikely people to do his will.

And that was a moment when Sharpton was alluding to George Floyd’s arrest history.

If George Floyd had been an Ivy League school graduate and one of these ones with a long title, we would have been accused of reacting to his prominence. If he’d been a multimillionaire, they would have said that we were reacting to his wealth. If he had been a famous athlete, as he was on the trajectory to be, we would have said we were reacting to his fame. But God took an ordinary brother —

And he was sort of talking about him as an ordinary —

— from the Third Ward —

— imperfect person —

— from the housing projects —

— from the Third Ward projects.

— that nobody thought much about but those that knew him and loved him. He took the rejected stone.

And it was a very powerful moment where he called George Floyd a rejected stone, making a reference to scripture.

God took the rejected stone and made him the cornerstone of a movement that’s going to change the whole wide world. [APPLAUSE]

And how those officers may have thought that nobody cared about a guy like that.

Oh, if you would have had any idea that all of us would react, you’d have took your knee off his neck.

And obviously the world knows now that the world did care about somebody like that, and how he died and how he was treated.

If you had any idea that preachers white and black was going to line up in a pandemic when we were told to stay inside, and we’d come out and march in the streets at the risk of our health, you’d have took your knee off his neck. Because you thought his neck didn’t mean nothing. But God made his neck to connect his head to his body, and you had no right to put your knee on that neck.

I think in the past, I think there has been this desire to only pay attention to sort of perfect victims, only to give attention to cases in which the person had this sort of holy life. And any brush with the law, no matter how many years ago, somehow was thought to taint how people viewed whatever police killing was in the news. And I think that shifted a little bit. And I see the difference in George Floyd.

Your family’s going to miss you, George. But your nation is going to remember your name.

And Sharpton ended his remarks by touching on this idea that George Floyd was imperfect, and he still deserves the movement that was happening.

So we’re going to lay you to your mama now. You called for mama. We’re going to lay your body next to hers. But I know mama’s already embraced you, George. You fought a good fight. You kept the faith. You finished your course. Go on and get your rest now. Go on and see mama now. We’re going to fight on. We’re going to fight on. We’re going to fight on. We’re going to fight on. [ORGAN MUSIC]

I’m going to speak to y’all real quick. I just want to say, man, that I got my shortcomings and my flaws, and I ain’t better than nobody else. But man, the shootings that’s going on man, I don’t care what hood you’re from man, where you’re at, man, I love you and God loves you, man. Put them guns down, man. That ain’t what it is. You know, we grow up this, man. And y’all hold y’all head up, man. You got parents out here selling plates, man, trying to bury their kids, man. Think about it, man. Love y’all.



We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today. On Tuesday morning, President Trump endorsed a conspiracy theory that a 75-year-old man — who police were filmed pushing to the ground during a protest in Buffalo last week — had been using his cell phone to knock out law enforcement radios on behalf of the Antifa movement. In a tweet, the president offered no evidence of the theory but named a right wing news organization, One America News Network, in his tweet.

Did you have a reaction to the president’s tweet early —

I learned a long time ago not to comment on tweets, and I’m not going to break that —

But they are official statements.

Later in the day, Republican lawmakers and administration officials, including the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, dodged questions from reporters. The man who was injured in the incident, Martin Gugino, is still recovering in the hospital from a serious head injury. Meanwhile, a police officer in New York City was arrested and charged with assault on Tuesday after shoving a young woman to the ground, giving her a concussion, another scene that was filmed on a cell phone. And —

This is wrong! This is America! Please, God, help us! I mean it! This is a crisis in our world to make us not exercise our right to vote!

Five states held their primary elections on Tuesday, including Georgia, where a new voting system put into place in 2018 after claims of voter suppression experienced catastrophic meltdowns. State-ordered voting machines were said to be missing or malfunctioning, causing voters to wait in line for hours at polling places across the state. Some gave up and left before casting a vote. The problems were made worse by the coronavirus pandemic, which left fewer poll workers available than usual and added to wait times, because machines had to be disinfected. Predominantly black areas of Georgia experienced some of the worst obstacles to voting, raising concerns that the problems would further disenfranchise black voters.



That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Caitlin Dickerson. See you tomorrow.

Like the funerals of Michael Brown and Eric Garner in 2014, Mr. Floyd’s funeral became a moment of both national reckoning and mourning, as black leaders and Mr. Floyd’s family celebrated his life and denounced the brutality of his death.

The funeral aired live on broadcast and cable television, and as it began at noon, the New York Stock Exchange went silent for eight minutes, 46 seconds — the length of time a Minneapolis police officer held Mr. Floyd’s neck under his knee before he died. It was the longest moment of silence on the stock exchange floor in its 228-year history.

In Houston, speaker after speaker invoked the political moment born out of what happened in Minneapolis.

“This was not just a tragedy. It was a crime,” said the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader who delivered the eulogy.

“We must commit to this family — all of these families, all of his children, grandchildren and all — that until these people pay for what they did, that we’re going to be there with them,” Mr. Sharpton said. “Because lives like George’s will not matter until somebody pays the cost for taking their lives.”

He admonished the country’s political and business leaders for belatedly saying they were sorry for the mistreatment of African-Americans. “Don’t apologize — give Colin Kaepernick a job back,” he said, referring to the former N.F.L. quarterback. “We don’t want an apology. We want him repaired.”

The service came after five days of public memorials in Minneapolis, North Carolina and Houston, and two weeks after the Minneapolis police officer was caught on video making the arrest that ended Mr. Floyd’s life.

On Monday, a public viewing in Houston drew nearly 6,400 people, including Gov. Greg Abbott, nurses fresh from work dressed in scrubs, new fathers holding babies and Mr. Floyd’s high school classmates. Following Tuesday’s service, he was to be buried at the Houston Memorial Gardens in a grave next to his mother, Larcenia Floyd, who died in 2018.

In a video message, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, offered his condolences to the family, saying he understood the weight of grieving in public. Mr. Biden, who has often connected to people through grief after suffering deep losses in his own life, spent time with the Floyd family in private on Monday.

“No child should have to ask the question that too many black children have had to ask for generations: ‘Why? Why is Daddy gone?’” Mr. Biden said in the video. “When there is justice for George Floyd, we will truly be on our way to racial justice in America.”

Mayor Sylvester Turner of Houston announced from the altar that he would sign an executive order on Tuesday to ban police chokeholds and strangleholds. Among other things, the order would also require police officers to give a warning before shooting.

“We honor him today because when he took his last breath, the rest of us will now be able to breathe,” said Mr. Turner, who is black.

No one mentioned President Trump, but Representative Al Green, Democrat of Texas, said that the next person in the country’s highest office needed to tackle racial inequality. And Brooklyn Williams, a young niece of Mr. Floyd’s, called for an end to hate crimes.

“Someone said, ‘Make America great again,’ but when has America ever been great?” she said. “America, it is time for a change!”

Mr. Sharpton began his eulogy with a warning that people — especially elected officials — tend to forget about police killings before officers have been brought to trial. Often, he said, bad police officers are “protected by wickedness in high places.”

The officer who pressed his knee into Mr. Floyd’s neck, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He and three other officers who participated in the arrest have been fired, and the other men were arrested on lesser charges.

Mr. Sharpton promised to be back in Minneapolis when the trial starts, and to march on Washington “by the tens of thousands” on the anniversary of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech in August.

One by one, Mr. Sharpton named the relatives of other black men and women whose killings have invoked concerns over racial injustice and asked them to stand. Other mourners stood, too, until everyone in the sanctuary was up and clapping and the funeral of one man briefly became a funeral for all the other lives lost.

“The mother of Trayvon Martin, will you stand,” he said. “The mother of Eric Garner, will you stand. The sister of Botham Jean, will you stand. The family of Pamela Turner, here in Houston, will you stand. The father of Michael Brown from Ferguson, Mo., will you stand. The father of Ahmaud Arbery, will you stand.

“All of these families came to stand with this family because they know better than anyone else the pain they will suffer from the loss that they have gone through,” Mr. Sharpton said.

Most mourners and public officials attending the funeral wore face masks. But the coronavirus pandemic at times seemed an afterthought. Among the hundreds of people inside the sanctuary and outside in the parking lot, people hugged, shook hands and passed funeral programs and business cards.

“I see that you all have destroyed all laws of social distancing,” joked the Rev. William Lawson, pastor emeritus of Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church in Houston.

After the service, Mr. Floyd’s body was carried out of the church toward the final, private observances at the cemetery. His body was borne by horse-drawn carriage along the final stretch of the route, with the public permitted to gather along the roadside and watch.

“You called for Mama,” Mr. Sharpton said during his eulogy. “We’re going to lay your body next to hers.”

A group of activists and Houston-area residents stood outside the church throughout the funeral — a much smaller gathering than the thousands who flocked to the church on Monday for the visitation.

Before the service began, a young man and woman walked up to the bouquets of flowers left by mourners at the church’s front doors, beneath a framed picture of Mr. Floyd. They knelt and prayed, and the young man raised his fist high.

The man, Arion Ford, 27, a community organizer from the St. Louis area who is a friend of the Floyd family, choked back tears as he stood up.

“I was praying for Mr. Floyd,” Mr. Ford said. “In my mind, I’m thinking, that could be my father, that could be my cousin, my brother. It could happen to any one of us. We are fed up, as you see out on the streets.”

His friend, Trisha Boyle, 29, a community activist also from St. Louis, said Mr. Floyd’s death had started a movement.

“We go to school,” she said. “I have two master’s degrees. Arion is studying to be a lawyer. We do the American dream. There’s this one piece that’s missing — we’re murdered. We’re murdered if we’re jogging. We’re murdered if we just so happen to have a counterfeit bill. Is that a death penalty?”

Later, as Mr. Floyd’s coffin was wheeled out of the church, a man standing in the back of the group of onlookers shouted, “We will breathe!” Another yelled, “Get your knee off our neck!”

The two rows of police officers stood to the side. As the coffin was lifted into the hearse, a chant broke out: “Say his name! George Floyd! Say his name! George Floyd!”

"Protesters, Everywhere (Including … Mitt Romney?)","Good morning and welcome to On Politics, a daily political analysis of the 2020 elections based on reporting by New York Times journalists.

Protests spread into the heartland, newsrooms grapple with how to cover them and prominent Republicans consider ditching Trump. It’s Monday, and this is your politics tip sheet.

Hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered this weekend across the country — and around the globe — in two of the most widespread days of protest since the death of George Floyd two weeks ago. In Washington alone, over 10,000 people assembled just north of the White House, which had been newly fortified with a high fence and a retinue of security forces wearing unmarked uniforms.

The Dallas Morning News confirmed late last week that many of those unidentified enforcers in Washington were in fact guards from federal prisons; they had been shipped to the capital from other parts of the country. Observers noticed that underneath their body armor, many of the riot forces were wearing shirts and jackets bearing the insignia of the federal prison in Beaumont, Texas. That facility, like many prisons, has been hit hard by the coronavirus; at least five guards there have tested positive for it, The Morning News reported.

Outside Beaumont, in nearby Vidor — a small Texas town known for its long history of Ku Klux Klan violence — over 100 protesters gathered on Saturday for an anti-racism protest. It was one of many examples of protests this weekend stretching into smaller towns and rural areas. All told, anti-racism demonstrations occurred in every state in America, and in countries around the world.

Mitt Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, joined a group of roughly 1,000 Christian protesters yesterday in the march on Washington. He is the most prominent Republican politician to have joined the marchers, and his appearance further bolstered the ties between the current movement and the civil rights struggles of the 1960s: Romney has often spoken of the fact that his father, the former governor of Michigan, participated in a march in the late ’60s. “We need to stand up and say that black lives matter,” Romney told a reporter as he walked yesterday.

Romney is one of a growing number of prominent Republicans who have started to publicly break with President Trump before the November election. The senator has said he won’t vote to re-elect Trump, though he hasn’t committed to backing Joe Biden either.

People close to George W. Bush and Jeb Bush say they’re also considering voting against the president. Colin Powell, who served as secretary of state in George Bush’s administration, has said that he will vote for Biden. And some former Republican leaders — including Paul Ryan and John Boehner, both onetime speakers of the House — have refused to say publicly how they’ll vote.

In Minneapolis, a majority of the City Council pledged on Sunday to entirely disband the city’s police force. It would be the first example of a major city replacing its police department, presumably with a new and fundamentally different system of public safety.

The announcement came just a day after the city’s mayor, Jacob Frey, was shouted down and chanted out of an enormous protest in downtown Minneapolis when he refused to commit to dismantling the police force. The nine council members who now say they will support the move represent a veto-proof majority, effectively rendering Frey’s opposition moot.

Democrats in Congress are preparing to unveil sweeping legislation today that would institute nationwide standards for police accountability. The bill does not take up the idea of dismantling or defunding police departments, but it would force states and municipalities to embrace practices like mandatory bias training in order to qualify for federal funds, according to a draft summary obtained by The New York Times.

“I don’t believe that you should disband police departments,” Karen Bass, the Democratic chairwoman of the House’s Congressional Black Caucus, said Sunday on CNN. “But I do think that in cities and states, we need to look at how we are spending resources and invest more in our communities.”

The unrest sweeping the country has also caused strife in many newsrooms, which have historically skewed white, and have often struggled to fairly address stories involving protesters and the police without privileging the narratives of those in uniform. At The Philadelphia Inquirer, the executive editor, Stan Wischnowski, resigned on Saturday after receiving blowback after his newspaper published an article last week under the headline “Buildings Matter, Too.” In that piece, the paper’s architecture critic bemoaned the defacing of buildings by demonstrators.

In nearby Pittsburgh, The Post-Gazette’s newsroom is in an uproar after two black reporters said they were barred from covering the protests because editors thought they had shown bias.

And The New York Times’s opinion section was intensely criticized — both publicly and internally — after publishing an incendiary Op-Ed last week by Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who argued for the use of military force against protesters. Many of the newspaper’s own reporters went on Twitter to publicly express their shame and outrage at the decision.

Yesterday, The Times’s editorial page editor, James Bennet, resigned. And Jim Dao, the deputy editorial page editor who oversees Op-Eds, is also leaving his position, though he will take a new job in the newsroom.

After a slew of political disappointments, college-age voters planning to cast ballots for the first time are increasingly disillusioned with voting. Some feel that this year’s chaos has upended their first election.

And now, galvanized by images of police brutality and the message of Black Lives Matter, many of these young voters — whose generation is no stranger to protests, having led movements around climate change and gun control in recent years — think taking to the streets may be much more effective.

Karla Salgado, a junior at Drake University, thinks that voting just isn’t enough.

“I think it’s just a very small piece of the puzzle — we run into the same problem year after year,” she said, “and it doesn’t seem like voting is what turns that around.”

Salgado added that, in an ideal world, voting would be a safe way to bring about change, but that it didn’t really work that way because most elected officials have lived a very different reality from those who are protesting.

“Black families, low-income people, refugees, immigrants — they push for their morals and worldview regardless of who is elected,” she said, “because a lot of the times the candidates they pick between don’t have their same perspective.”

Elijah McCutcheon, a junior at Otterbein University, said he saw protests as a way to “bring attention to what we should be voting for” — as a way to pass laws to hold officers accountable in the present and avoid police brutality in the future.

“If we just protest and don’t vote to change laws, all this protesting was for no reason,” he said.

"A Small Mississippi Town, ‘Asking for a Breath’ After Mayor’s Remarks Unleash Protests","PETAL, Miss. — In what has become a morning routine, Lorraine Bates walks the seven-tenths of a mile to City Hall from her house in Petal, Miss. In the first days of demonstrations, she joined some 200 other protesters, many of them white, chanting and waving “Black Lives Matter” posters. But there were also times when it was just her and a groundskeeper who mowed around her.

She would keep coming, she said, until the mayor of Petal resigned, or at least exhibited something like genuine remorse for what he said about George Floyd after his fatal encounter with the Minneapolis police, including, “If you can say you can’t breathe, you’re breathing.”

“As long as I’ve got my health and my strength, I’ll be out here every day,” Ms. Bates, 70, said as she sat on her rolling walker on the front lawn of City Hall. She said her persistence was informed by earlier civil rights fights, recalling the stamina of the activists who had influenced her as a young black woman rooted in the Deep South.

“I’m here because I have six grandsons,” she added. “When they put their knee on George Floyd’s neck, they might as well have put it on my grandson.”

The nation has been unsettled by the tsunami of fury and despair that Mr. Floyd’s death helped set off, unleashing mass demonstrations and a forceful response from law enforcement in cities across the country.

That wave has reached small towns like Petal.

The protests in these communities were, by and large, not nearly as explosive as the ones dominating much of the news media’s attention. Yet the tension is still there, just more subtle and concentrated as a sweeping national discourse over police brutality and systemic racism is funneled into the confines of tight-knit towns.

With much of life in Petal still quieted by the coronavirus, the most visible stage for unrest has been City Hall, with protesters huddled outside and squeezed into board of aldermen meetings. Some stared down their former high school social studies teacher, now the mayor, and condemned his actions as racist.

“I think the same way that George Floyd was asking for a breath, this city is asking for a breath,” Justin Powell, 29, a black systems engineer, told the mayor, Hal Marx, during a recent board meeting. He wore a red Petal High School Panthers polo shirt and said that he had been in Mr. Marx’s government class. “We need you to step down, sir.”

Mr. Marx has remained defiant. He has acknowledged the criticism provoked by his comments, which he posted to Twitter and then deleted. “I regret being insensitive to a man’s death,” he said in an interview.

But he has refused to resign.

“You shouldn’t lose your livelihood over a stupid remark,” Mr. Marx, who is white, said.

Still, some residents said his words had what were most likely unintended consequences: Mr. Floyd’s death probably would not have reverberated this way in Petal, a mostly white city of some 10,000 people, if Mr. Marx had not said what he said.

“We wouldn’t be here,” said Michael McCullum, a 24-year-old lifelong Petal resident.

Mr. McCullum and other black residents contended that it would be wrong to define Petal as overtly hostile toward them. Instead, the sentiments expressed by the mayor betrayed the gnarled history that lurks just below the surface in Mississippi and the countless ways that legacy reveals itself. “He’s exposed an issue in Petal that’s been covered up for so long,” Mr. McCullum said.

It has been similar in other smaller communities across the country, including in Georgia, Alabama, Montana and North Dakota, reflecting the depths to which Mr. Floyd’s death has resonated and the overflowing reservoir of exasperation it has tapped into. In some towns, people are organizing or attending demonstrations for the first time.

Protesters in Petal had gathered outside of the mayor’s house, and one man held a constant vigil there.

“It made us look bad,” Lisa Foster, a longtime resident of the city and a military historian, said of Mr. Marx’s comments. “It made headlines all over the world, and people aren’t happy that he’s made our city look terrible.”

But Ms. Foster, who is white, said the response from residents has been different. “This,” she said, “has restored my faith in Petal and even in humanity.”

She pointed out the power of watching the city’s aldermen, all of whom are white men, as a series of black men and women stood up during the public comment portion of recent meetings. The speakers used their allotted three minutes to go beyond imploring Mr. Marx to resign.

Some called for the Petal Police Department to put body cameras on its officers. A mother told of her son’s frightening run-in with an officer when he was pulled over after a late dinner at a Waffle House. One after another, they sought to illuminate the stresses and fears associated with life as African-Americans in small-town Mississippi.

The fury now has also brought renewed attention to the death of Marc Davis, a black man who was killed in 2017 by a white Petal police officer responding to a car crash.

The authorities said that Mr. Davis, 34, was shot after an altercation escalated between him and the officer; state investigators later cleared the officer of wrongdoing. Mr. Davis’s family said he had been trying to flag help and the officer had responded with excessive force. His mother, Catherine Davis, has taken part in the rallies in recent days, telling the crowd, “My son was murdered on your streets.”

For the Rev. Anthony T. McCullum, the pastor of Piney Grove Baptist Church in Petal, the mayor’s words rekindled memories of an uglier time. In a city meeting, he described discrimination he had faced growing up in the town: the baseball league that would not let him play, the scuffles he got into when he was younger because other boys had called him racial slurs. He recalled as a child seeing hooded Klansmen standing along a main road.

And yet, it was also the place where classmates at Petal High chose him as one of the friendliest and most handsome students in the class of 1984. He raised his children in Petal, including Michael McCullum, who joined his father and other family members at the meeting.

“I’m an educated man,” Pastor McCullum, 54, said. “I could have went anywhere, did anything I wanted to do. We chose Petal.”

About 85 percent of Petal’s residents are white. The town, its streets lined mostly with ranch houses on big, pine-covered lots and some of the highest-performing public schools in Mississippi, was built as a bedroom community for Hattiesburg, where more than half of that city’s population of 45,000 people is black.

The protests in Petal started last month when Mr. Marx wrote on Twitter that he “didn’t see anything unreasonable” in the video showing Mr. Floyd pinned to the ground by a police officer’s knee. He suggested that Mr. Floyd had died of a heart attack or an overdose.

Mr. Marx’s posts were widely condemned, including by the city’s police chief.

The city aldermen held a special meeting in which they took a vote and unanimously urged Mr. Marx to resign. He rebuffed their request, saying at the meeting, according to The Hattiesburg American, “I will never surrender to the mob mentality.”

Some residents said they abhorred the spectacle his comments stirred as much as the comments themselves. And he had some defenders.

“Hal and I never got along, but I do know that he regrets what he said,” said Jim Cavazos, who is white and has lived in Petal for 38 years.

Mr. Marx, the mayor since 2009, believed that he had become an avatar for the protesters’ larger discontent. “They’re trying to project that onto Petal itself, and that’s not Petal,” he said of the national friction over race.

“It’s easy to paint me as some uneducated bigot that doesn’t care about the lives of black people,” he said, adding that the perception was inaccurate. “You almost stereotype yourself as a racist when you say you’re not a racist, but what else can I say?”

Mr. Marx, whose father was a trooper with the Mississippi State Police, grew up in the city. He worked as a reporter and a managing editor for a newspaper in the nearby town of Laurel, and then taught government and economics at Petal High for 11 years before entering politics.

The recent upheaval, he said, had been painful yet revelatory. “I have had a dose of humility,” he said. “It’s not that I thought everyone always agrees with me, but I didn’t realize it did hurt people in a way that makes it a personal injury to them even though it wasn’t about them.”

He said he had received messages that were threatening and hateful. But he added that his resistance to resigning was a matter of principle: He was exercising his right to free speech. It was also practical, he said: He has to work another year before he can collect his retirement, and he refuses to jeopardize that.

“Let’s go ahead and have a conversation,” he said, referring to people demanding change. “Is there something we can do in these next 12 months while I’m still mayor? Let’s have a conversation beyond ‘Hal Marx must resign’ because Hal Marx isn’t resigning.”

Some are coming to terms with that.

At a recent aldermen meeting, Pastor McCullum declared that he had forgiven the mayor. It was not an easy decision, he said, but it was the right one. Ms. Bates did not agree. The fight was not over. She left the meeting knowing that she would be walking back to City Hall in the morning.

G.O.P. Scrambles to Respond to Public Demands for Police Overhaul,"WASHINGTON — Congressional Republicans, caught flat-footed by an election-year groundswell of public support for overhauling policing in America to address systemic racism, are struggling to coalesce around a legislative response.

Having long fashioned themselves as the party of law and order, Republicans have been startled by the speed and extent to which public opinion has shifted under their feet in recent days after the killings of unarmed black Americans by the police and the protests that have followed. The abrupt turn has placed them on the defensive.

Adding to their challenge, President Trump has offered only an incendiary response, repeatedly invoking “law and order,” calling for military and police crackdowns on protesters, promoting conspiracy theories, and returning time and again to the false claim that Democrats agitating for change are simply bent on defunding police departments.

On Tuesday, Republicans on Capitol Hill rushed to distance themselves from that approach, publicly making clear that they would lay out their own legislation and refraining from attacking a sweeping Democratic bill unveiled this week aimed at combating racial bias and excessive use of force by the police. The measure, which House Democrats plan to push through this month, would make it easier to track, prosecute and punish police misconduct, ban chokeholds and restrict the use of deadly force by officers, as well as condition federal grants on anti-bias training and other practices to combat racial profiling and discrimination.

Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, pressed on whether his party would embrace such steps, said on Tuesday that Republicans had yet to fashion their response.

“We are still wrestling with America’s original sin,” Mr. McConnell told reporters on Capitol Hill. “We try to get better, but every now and then, it is perfectly clear we are a long way from the finish line. And I think the best way for Senate Republicans to go forward on this is to listen to one of our own who has had these experiences.”

He said that he had tasked the Republicans’ lone black member, Tim Scott of South Carolina, to lead a group of senators to draft a conservative response that they could get behind. Ignoring repeated questions from reporters about Mr. Trump’s views, Mr. McConnell said senators would pursue “what we think is the appropriate response,” a notable shift from his customary refusal to bring up any legislation without an assurance that the president would embrace and sign it.

In the House, a group of Republicans on the Judiciary Committee — led by Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio — was looking at its own plans to reimagine police training, increase accountability for officers who use improper force or violate the rights of civilians, and collect new data to track the behavior by departments across the country.

But privately, Republican lawmakers and aides conceded they had few proposals ready to offer and were instead racing to reach a consensus about how to proceed. Late Tuesday afternoon, Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, rushed to Capitol Hill with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, to huddle with Republicans about what they could quickly agree on.

Mr. Meadows told reporters after that meeting that Mr. Trump was in favor of overhauling policing laws “sooner rather than later.” But he declined to name any specific legislative priorities the White House would support, saying the administration would be “responsive” to suggestions made by “stakeholders” on Capitol Hill.

The dilemma for Republicans is urgent. For decades, their party has been built on the legacy of the “Southern strategy,” in which candidates sought to win over onetime Democrats by portraying themselves as tough on crime and disorder.

Over the years, some Republicans have used the issue to traffic in racial stereotypes and fear-mongering, like when George H.W. Bush and his supporters highlighted the case of a black murderer named Willie Horton, who raped a white woman and assaulted her boyfriend while on a prison furlough, to portray Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, his Democratic presidential rival, as insufficiently tough on crime.

Mr. Trump has sought to stir up white grievance as well, calling immigrants criminals, berating professional African-American football players for kneeling during the national anthem, and calling protesters of police brutality against black Americans “thugs.” But polls now show that huge majorities of the country, including whites, believe that policing must change.

“In every survey, you see intensity, determination and unity among African-Americans that the time for statements is done and the time for meaningful, measurable action is now,” said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster and messaging consultant. “The turning point is among white respondents, who not only acknowledge that injustice has happened, but now also agree that action, not words, are necessary.”

A Washington Post poll conducted over the past week indicated that nearly 70 percent of Americans viewed the killing of George Floyd — the black man whose death last month after an encounter with Minneapolis police officers — as indicative of a broader problem with law enforcement, rather than an isolated episode. The figure was significantly higher than those who said the same nearly six years ago after the police killed an unarmed black man in Ferguson, Mo.

It is yet unclear what kind of action Mr. Trump, who has embraced law enforcement as he eyes an increasingly treacherous political landscape, might be willing to support. Trying to polarize the electorate before the fall campaign, the president instead has spent much of the past two days posting messages on Twitter that called for “LAW & ORDER.” And, on Tuesday morning, he veered into the conspiratorial, claiming that a 75-year-old protester shoved violently to the pavement and injured by Buffalo police officers could have been “a set up.”

Uncertainty about whether Mr. Trump would ultimately sign a bill could create havoc down the line, when Republicans on Capitol Hill put forward a proposal that the White House does not like.

For example, some congressional Republicans have voiced an openness to changing the legal doctrine known as qualified immunity that shields police officers from being held legally liable for damages sought by citizens whose constitutional rights were violated.

Senator Mike Braun of Indiana said he was interested in revisiting the issue, even though a day earlier, Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, said the issue was likely to be a “nonstarter” and noted that Attorney General William P. Barr, who embodies the tough-on-crime approach Republicans traditionally embrace, was opposed.

“That’d be the one thing that shows our conference means business,” Mr. Braun said. “You never know, this might be a watershed moment.”

The prospect of a messy intraparty split is one reason that Mr. McConnell generally refuses to bring up legislation that has not been preapproved by Mr. Trump, but Republicans appear to see more potential risk in waiting around for the White House to move than in crossing the president.

“We are on a separate track from the White House,” Mr. Scott told reporters, a few hours before meeting on Capitol Hill with Mr. Meadows and Mr. Kushner.

Republicans are also feeling pressure from a newly confident Democratic Party, which believes it has finally reclaimed ground when it comes to public trust around law and safety. Many of them fear that Democrats will brand any compromise that Republicans would be willing to accept as insufficient, and use the issue instead to score political points in an election year that appears increasingly promising for them.

In a brief interview on Tuesday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she saw no reason that Republicans should not support the Democrats’ bill if the public does. She compared the political dynamic with gun safety, where Republicans have seen public opinion surpass their appetite to legislate and the difference undermine them electorally in suburban America.

“I hope it is better than what they did on their own proposal with gun safety,” she said of whatever Mr. McConnell and Mr. Scott were putting together.

On Wednesday, the Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing examining the changes proposed in their legislation. Philonise Floyd, the brother of George Floyd, will testify. A House vote is expected by the end of the month.

With pressure mounting, a number of Senate Republicans indicated during a private luncheon on Tuesday that they were eager to pass some sort of overhaul package. Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, who has recently made the case for the military to be brought in amid the protests, stood to urge his colleagues to be “sensitive” to the experience that black men have with law enforcement and called on lawmakers to change that relationship, according to two people familiar with the private comments.

Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, also pressed for his party to take action.

“Judging by emails, phone calls to the office and conversations, there’s a great sense of sorrow regarding George Floyd’s death,” Mr. Cassidy said. “One law enforcement officer told me that big departments cannot reform from within. They need an external influence for accountability.”

Mr. Scott shared a preliminary proposal during the lunch, but lawmakers said it would continue to evolve.

Like the Democrats’ bill, Mr. Scott’s would make lynching a federal hate crime, allocate new funds to promote the use of police body cameras and potentially penalize those who do not use them, set up a national police commission study to determine the national best practices for policing and push law enforcement agencies to report more data on the use of force by officers.

But there were key differences as well, in line with a conservative philosophy that states and cities should have control over their forces. Mr. Scott said the Democrats’ legislation bordered on “a nationalization of some of the underlying issues or techniques” that he would reject. And he said that while he shared the goal of outlawing techniques like chokeholds and “no knock” warrants in drug cases, he preferred collecting data to better understand their use to Democrats’ proposed ban.

“Time is of the essence,” Mr. Scott told reporters. “I think it is important for this nation to take a very powerful stand and position that says, look, we’re hearing and we’re reacting in a very positive, constructive manner that doesn’t create a binary choice between supporting law enforcement and supporting communities of color.”

Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican leader, has privately indicated that his conference could support proposals to collect more data about instances of police misconduct, create new training standards for officers on the use of force, and give departments the ability to more easily fire problematic officers, according to people familiar with his thinking.

Romney Marches With Protesters in Washington,"WASHINGTON — Senator Mitt Romney of Utah marched with demonstrators toward the White House on Sunday, appearing to be the first Republican senator to join the thousands across the country protesting the death of George Floyd in police custody.

Mr. Romney shared on Twitter a photograph of himself marching among the crowd, with the caption “Black Lives Matter.”

Black Lives Matter. pic.twitter.com/JpXUFlxH2J

Mr. Romney, who marched with a group of Christians, told a Washington Post reporter that he had joined the protest to show that “we need to end violence and brutality, and to make sure that people understand that black lives matter.”

In joining the protest, Mr. Romney again found himself at odds with President Trump, who has pushed for a military response to the unrest, and standing apart from most of his party, as when he became the sole Republican senator to vote to remove Mr. Trump from office.

Republicans have largely been vocal in condemning the police officers who have been charged in connection with Mr. Floyd’s death, but few have publicly joined protesters marching across the county. Last week, Representative Will Hurd of Texas, the lone black Republican in the House, joined a peaceful protest, marching alongside Mr. Floyd’s family.

Democrats, by contrast, have made a point of supporting and participating in the rallies. Representative Joyce Beatty of Ohio was hit by pepper spray during a demonstration in her state late last month, while Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California made a trip last week to briefly speak to protesters gathered outside the Capitol.

Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon was seen on Saturday handing out water bottles to protesters marching through Washington, while Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York attended a protest and handed out masks to people walking by.

The visibility of politicians at the protests “does matter to a degree,” said Vania Brown, a protester from Maryland who had come to join the marches in Washington on Sunday. “But right now, I’m skeptical of any political party.”

The civil unrest around the country, coupled with renewed calls to address police brutality against people of color, has amplified pressure on lawmakers — particularly Republicans — to address not only police officers’ use of force, but also racial discrimination and the economic and social disparities that the coronavirus pandemic has further exposed.

Democrats are expected on Monday to unveil sweeping legislation that would make it easier to prosecute police misconduct and recover damages from officers found to have violated civil rights. In the coming weeks, the Senate and the House both plan to hold hearings on proposals to improve policing and counter racial discrimination.

Compared with previous instances in which black men have died after police officers have used excessive force, Republicans have been almost uniformly outraged at the case of Mr. Floyd, who died after a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.

The administration’s move to crack down on demonstrators prompted a rare break with Mr. Trump, as some Republicans moved to distance themselves from the president’s threats to send the military to confront protesters. Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, went so far as to endorse scathing criticism from Jim Mattis, the former defense secretary, of Mr. Trump’s handling of the protests.

Among Republicans, Mr. Romney in particular has been vocal in condemning the circumstances surrounding Mr. Floyd’s death, saying last month that “the George Floyd murder is abhorrent.”

He has also reflected on how his father, George Romney, participated in a civil rights march in the 1960s as governor of Michigan, quoting him on Twitter and sharing a photo of him at the protest in the 1960s in Detroit.

“Force alone will not eliminate riots,” Mr. Romney quoted his father saying. “We must eliminate the problems from which they stem.”

April Cole, a Capitol Hill resident who had been protesting since noon with her 21-year-old daughter, dismissed Mr. Romney’s joining the march as a political stunt.

“Why does it take us to lose someone for them to show up?” she asked. “We need change.”

But Monique, a Washington native marching near the White House who declined to identify herself further, said Mr. Romney was setting an example for other policymakers, calling him a decent man.

Despite protests early last week that were met with flash-bang explosions, chemical irritants and an aggressive use of military helicopters, a steady stream of people have persisted in marching through the nation’s capitol. 

On Sunday, locals were barbecuing in front of the historic St. John’s Episcopal Church, where just days earlier the police had brutally cleared protesters to allow Mr. Trump to pose for photographs.

Bob Marley’s daughter, Makeda Jahnesta Marley, drew a crowd on the north end of Lafayette Park in front the White House on Sunday evening, singing “Redemption Song.”"
What Would Efforts to Defund or Disband Police Departments Really Mean?,"MINNEAPOLIS — Across the country, calls are mounting from some activists and elected officials to defund, downsize or abolish police departments. A veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis City Council pledged on Sunday to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department, promising to create a new system of public safety in a city where law enforcement has long been accused of racism.

The calls for change have left people uncertain of what those changes would really mean and how cities would contend with crime. Much remains uncertain and the proposals vary between cities, but here are answers to some questions about the issue.

Calls to defund police departments are generally seeking spending cuts to police forces that have consumed ever larger shares of city budgets in many cities and towns. Minneapolis, for instance, is looking to cut $200 million from its $1.3 billion overall annual budget, said Lisa Bender, the City Council president. The police budget in 2020 was $189 million. She hopes to shift money to other areas of need in the city.

Many activists want money now spent on overtime for the police or on buying expensive equipment for police departments to be shifted to programs related to mental health, housing and education — areas that the activists say with sufficient money could bring about systemic societal change and cut down on crime and violence.

Leaders in different cities have advocated various specific plans, but generally speaking, the calls aim to reimagine public safety tactics in ways that are different from traditional police forces. Activists say their intent is to ensure safety and justice but to wind up with a different system. Years of consent decrees and investigations into human rights violations by police departments have yielded little change, they say, so a more fundamental shift is needed.

Some proposals call for ending no-knock warrants and military-style raids. Others seek to restrict the flow of military-style gear to police departments and change police tactics used against protesters. One group described an idea for policing in which people attending events look out for one another but emergency workers are standing by in the background, handing out water and ready to step in if needed.

Some cities have already made changes to policing. In Austin, Texas, 911 calls are answered by operators who inquire whether the caller needs police, fire or mental health services — part of a major revamping of public safety that took place last year when the city budget added millions of dollars for mental health issues. In Eugene, Ore., a team called CAHOOTS — Crisis Assistance Helping Out on the Streets — deploys a medic and a crisis worker with mental health training to emergency calls. Camden, N.J., revamped its policing in 2017 with officers handing out more warnings than tickets and undergoing training that places emphasis on officers holding their fire.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”



Today, several major U.S. cities are now proposing ways to defund and even dismantle their police departments. John Eligon on the thinking behind those plans and what they might look like in practice.

It’s Tuesday, June 9.

(CHANTING) I can’t breathe! I can’t breathe!

In the early days of the protests after George Floyd was killed —

(CHANTING) No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace!

— it was just pure emotions and raw rage.

[EXPLETIVE] these racist [EXPLETIVE] police!

But pretty soon, once the more fiery protests and fiery unrest died down, then we started seeing the organizers come in and talking about what they want. And one thing we quickly saw were these face masks that people were wearing. They were black, and they had yellow writing on them. And they said, “Defund police.”

Hmm.

And from there, you start hearing these calls at protest, at rallies.

(CHANTING) Defund the police! Defund the police!

You start hearing, “Defund the police.”

You start hearing calls to abolish the police. You start seeing people waving signs. And it became clear that this was an opening that a lot of activists saw to take this moment of a very brutal police killing and turn it into something much larger.

Do the right thing!

Defund the police!

So John, what do these concepts — defund, dismantle, abolish the police — what exactly do they mean?

To defund, when activists say that, what they mean is taking money away from the police department’s budget and redirect it toward other things — whether that be social services, agencies, maybe mental health agencies — that can do functions that police are often called on to do.

Mm-hmm.

But if you fully defund it, you can get to a space where the police department is abolished. And so essentially, what that means is that there is no more police department as we know it. You don’t call these men and women in blue shirts to come racing to your door with their guns in hand. It means that they have to figure out some other form of providing that public safety, and the police department would not be that form.

And where did these concepts come from?

Well, at their core, they come from the problems and issues that especially communities of color, especially black communities, have had with policing. They see police coming into their communities to brutalize them, not to protect and serve them. And that has really influenced this desire to keep the police away, to do something else. And we’ve seen, basically, that governments and police forces, they respond with certain reforms. We’ve seen efforts for body cameras. We’ve seen diversifying the police departments. We’ve seen changes to the rules on use of force.

Mm-hmm.

But what became clear to a lot of today’s activists, and what they say explicitly, is that these reforms are not working. If you look at since Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Missouri six years ago, the police have continued to kill people at high rates, and especially black people at disproportionately high rates. And so for them, the only solution is to tear it down and build something new.

So John, what might it actually look like in practice to defund or abolish a police department?

So for instance, if someone is homeless and they’re struggling on the streets, a person can call 9-1-1, and instead of an armed police officer being sent out, perhaps there can be an outreach worker from a homeless services agency. Or if you have someone having a mental health episode, then again, you can call 9-1-1, and instead of a police officer, maybe a health care worker, a mental health worker will come out. And the idea behind it is to really cut down the interactions between armed police officers and civilians. And by doing that, the hope is that it will reduce their conflict and the potential for people getting hurt or killed by police officers.

Right. I mean, that makes a certain sense, especially for a community where there’s not a lot of violent crime. But every community is different, right? And some towns, some cities — I think about New York City, for example — have a significantly higher rate of violent crime that would seem to require having armed police. So how do activists think about that?

For a lot of the activists that I spoke to, the issue was about centering public safety on communities. And one activist that I spoke to, Arianna Nason, she said essentially it’s going to be up to each community to decide what public safety looks like for itself.

It’s going to be up to every community to decide what they need. We can’t decide that.

So maybe that’s armed patrols. Maybe that’s mental health workers. Maybe that’s some sort of mobile units with social workers sitting in it, and people are trained in using force and different things. One of the big ideas is this idea of community policing, community watch. And it’s interesting. I had said isn’t an issue, though, with community policing or community patrols, neighborhood watch, that if I walk into that community, as a black man with dreadlocks, if I walk into one of these communities, we see what happens with neighborhood watch. We see Trayvon Martin. We see Ahmaud Arbery.

Should that be a concern, then? I guess with this community-type based model that certain people who look a certain way might go into the neighborhood, and that community might decide to take it into their own hands and then take it overboard, I guess.

And she took off her sunglasses. She looked at me, and she said —

No, I get that. And I’ll be really real with you. For me, personally, I don’t have all the answers for that. I don’t. And I wish I did. A lot of it is —

Honestly, I don’t really know the answer to that right now.

Huh.

She was not sure exactly what the answer was. And see, this is all to say, it’s still very tricky and very much a work in progress. But what she did say is that the current system also is not working for me either. So it’s a matter of what are they going to do differently? And they believe that something drastically different needs to be done.

Mm-hmm. As best you can tell, would any of the familiar elements of an existing police department — I’m thinking, for the sake of argument, homicide detectives, special victims units that investigate sexual assault or rape — do those remain? Do they take a different form? Do they adopt a different name? Has that been fleshed out?

I would say, no, it’s not been fleshed out. Because again, we go back to the fact that this is not going to be some federal commission, or even state commission or a city commission for anywhere that’s going to come up with, like, these are the rules for public safety now. And these are all things that need to be worked out. And I think what people say with things like homicide investigations, with sex crimes investigations and things like that, they say a couple of things. One, the police are not doing a good job at those anyways. So you have lots of cities where the clearance rate on homicides and other investigations is miserable. You had, even here in Minneapolis, there was a big scandal with all the rape kits that they had untested. So they had a lot of issues with crimes that were not being investigated properly. And then, the second thing that people say is that those jobs can be taken up by specialized, trained people. You can build new institutions to do those things that aren’t necessary policing. I did talk to one council member who said, maybe there’s still police, but for very, very limited role, and many of their responsibilities are farmed out. You know, anything short of some sort of active violence, you don’t need police for. So in some people’s eyes, that would still be a police force. But one thing that the people who are most ardent about abolishing the police or defunding the police, even, they make it clear that they don’t just want a system in which it’s police in another name, police with another uniform on.



And these demands to defund the police, they’ve actually been brewing in Minneapolis for several years now. Ever since a police killing back in 2015, there’s been several local activist groups working on it. And those activist groups came together this past weekend in what was probably the biggest and most clearest demand for defunding the police.

We’ll be right back.

(CHANTING) Abolish the M.P.D.!

So there were hundreds of activists who went and gathered in front of the mayor Jacob Frey’s house.

Abolish the M.P.D.! And they had a megaphone. They were chanting. They were screaming. And sure enough, the mayor came out to talk to the protesters. He kind of made his way through the crowd, walked up to the front, and you had one of the lead organizers for a group called the Black Visions Collective. Kandace Montgomery, she was standing up on a riser there, talking down in a megaphone to the mayor.

Jacob Frey, we have a yes-or-no question for you. Yes or no, will you commit to defunding Minneapolis Police Department?

[INAUDIBLE]

And you could tell, like, there is this hesitation because he knows this is not going to go well, right? You have all these very vocal, very ardent activists around you who want you to defund the police.

Will you defund the Minneapolis Police Department?

[CROWD MURMURING]

All right, be quiet y’all. Be quiet, because it’s important that we actually hear this. It’s important that we hear this, because if y’all don’t know, he’s up for re-election next year.

[CROWD CHEERING]

And then —

I do not support the full abolition of the police department.

All right!

You’re wasting our time! Get the [EXPLETIVE] out of here!

And he gives his answer — he does not support full abolition of the police.

(CHANTING) Go home, Jacob, go home! Go home, Jacob, go home!

And he turns around, and he just kind of walked off into the sea of people.

(CHANTING) Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame!

So after this event, there was already an event planned for the following day by some of these same activists organizations, in which they were going to bring council members who were supportive of their cause onto a stage in a park in the Southern part of the city. And they were going to try to get them to make a commitment to defunding the police.

So a lot like what they had done to the mayor?

Exactly.

Hi, Minneapolis. You look so beautiful today. I’m Lisa Bender. I’m the president of the Minneapolis City Council.

And so we had this gathering where there were hundreds of residents.

Our efforts at incremental reform have failed. Period.

And you had council members.

Our commitment is to do what’s necessary to keep every single member of our community safe, and to tell the truth that the Minneapolis Police are not doing that. [CROWD CHEERS]

And you had nine of them who went up on the stage.

We are here today to begin the process of ending the Minneapolis Police Department. [CROWD CHEERS]

And then all nine of them each read a part pledging to defend the police.

All of us on this stage support this statement, and we stand with the people of Minneapolis in fighting for a safer community. [CROWD CHEERS]

The last council member, he basically said, and we are all committing to this pledge. And at that moment, it was like this emotional eruption.

[INAUDIBLE], get up, y’all. We are transforming our city right now. Get up! get

You had white people, black people, Asian people, all putting their fists in the air, shouting, defund the police, defund police.

(CHANTING) Defund M.P.D.! Defund M.P.D.! Defund M.P.D.!

So just to be clear, this is not a vote, and not necessarily even a pledge to vote, but this is a public commitment to defund the police — to do the very thing that the mayor, when asked, declined to agree to 24 hours before.

Yes, exactly. This is a pledge that they are going to defund the police. It is not a vote. It is not anything set in stone or written. But these are putting them all on record in front of many community members, saying that we are going to do this. And I even asked the activists about that. I said, we’ve heard politicians say things before and not keep those pledges. But this is something that they saw they’ve been working on with them together in tandem. So I think there’s a level of trust there that this pledge has really meant something. And you could see it in the reaction of the people who were there. They were really describing it as their Civil Rights Movement, their Voting Rights Act moment.

Wow. And John, can the members of the City Council who were in that park, making this pledge, do they have the actual authority to take away funding from the police department?

Yes, they absolutely have voting authority to do that. The council actually controls the police department’s budget. And what’s more significant about this moment is that because there were nine of them, those nine seats represents a veto-proof majority. So even if the mayor, Jacob Frey, does not want this to happen, if that coalition sticks together, they can do this on their own. And I think what we’re seeing is this sentiment is growing in traction in certain places. Like we already have in New York and Los Angeles, the mayors in both of those cities have already said that they are going to be redirecting funds that were intended for the police toward other parts of the city, toward other agencies in the city.

I’m curious what the appetite for this kind of change to policing is, beyond the cities where there are largely Democratic city councils and mayors, and where this is now under discussion.

That’s a very key question, right? We’re already seeing conservatives coming out against this and talking about this is as very radical leftist step to be taking. We see Donald Trump already tweeting about it. So certainly, this is something that, for conservative communities, something like this would be a tougher sell. And so again, policing is a very local thing. So what you experience and what the police force does or does not look like in Minneapolis is going to be very different than what it does or does not look like in Edina, which is just outside of Minneapolis, or any other suburb. So it’s going to be, in some ways, a patchwork of public safety, I think, if these things start happening around the country.

And I guess an open question is whether or not this has entered the mainstream, even of the Democratic Party. Just a few hours before you and I began to talk, Joe Biden came out and said he does not support defunding the police.

Yeah, this is certainly not something that is part of the mainstream or moderate Democratic platform. That said, you do get some people who might be in these more moderate spaces, you do get their attention and you do get their ear, is this sense that policing is not working — which is just the basis of what these defund or abolish the police efforts are about, is that the system is not working. And so you will get even the more moderate folks to say that, to buy into that. And that may not result in them supporting a defund or abolishment, but will it support more stringent reforms, more significant reforms to police? So we’ll see what happens.

I wonder how the activists that you’re talking to see the challenge of explaining what these concepts are going to mean. Because in this moment, I think many Americans are really hearing these calls — defund, dismantle, abolish — for the first time. And they may be very wary of them, and they may see them as quite radical.

What the activists will tell you is that while it might sound radical for many Americans, this actually is not all that radical for a large section of this country.

What was your name, sir?

Yaazirah

How do you spell that?

Y-A-H- —

If you go to black and brown communities — like I went up to the North Side of Minneapolis — and you talk to people about their experiences with the police there, it is not the experience of expecting an officer to come and help you. It’s exactly the opposite. And I was speaking with a couple there, Amanda and Yaazirah Brazelton.

It’s about time for a change.

A change, yeah.

Yeah. About time for a change.

And they were telling me that from a young age, essentially, they already had horrific experiences with the police.

[INAUDIBLE] I have police put guns in my face, you know, at seven years old, coming to my house with my mother and my father arguing, just regular argument that happens with a husband and wife.

Yaazirah, he was seven years old when the police came to his house when his parents were having an argument.

And they put guns in my face and put us all on the ground.

And then they stuck a gun in his face.

They traumatized me in childhood, so I was really against white police officers since.

And his wife Amanda, she was 14 when she was in a car with white people, and she’s black.

We were driving in the car. All my white friends got out. And as soon as I got out, they pulled guns, yelled at —

And when they were pulled over, the cops let the white people out, but then they pulled guns on her.

I’m 14 years old, in the backseat of the car, not doing nothing wrong. And that was my first real incident with the police in that interaction.

And so the way they see the police department is not a force where you call and then an Officer Friendly shows up.

Man, I got a houseful of kids that are scared of the police because of what they’ve seen.

It’s one where Amanda recalled her children have already had run-ins with the police that when someone was breaking into their house once, she didn’t call the police, but she called family and friends.

And I called him. I called my brother. I called my uncle. I called my dad, my mom, before called the police.

Why didn’t you call the police?

Because they kill black people. They’ll call me, I’ll get killed in my own home.

So it’s already a lived experience, a lived reality for people in many black communities, that the police are essentially a force that only exists, in their eyes, to harass them, to brutalize them and not to protect them. And what the activists hope is that people who are scared that abolishing police will suddenly lead to a breakdown in their communities and just rampant violence, they’re saying, no, this will create outcomes that will make the community safer and better, not just for affluent white communities, but for all communities across the country. And so what activists are asking is that people who see this as a radical idea, who can’t envision a world without police, they’re asking them to just walk in these people’s shoes, understand what they’re going through.



John, thank you very much.

Thank you.

The nine members of the city council that came from every corner of our city to stand together to make this commitment, we don’t have all the answers.

In an interview on Monday, the president of the Minneapolis City Council, one of the nine members who has pledged to defund the city’s police department, acknowledged that implementing the plan would likely take years.

And if you look back at the last 150 years of our police department, it is becoming increasingly clear that that model of policing isn’t working. I hope it won’t take 150 years to get to that looking forward, that next solution. But we have a lot of wisdom in our community. We have invested in [INAUDIBLE] —



We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today.

Good morning, everyone. The Justice in Policing Act establishes a bold, transformative vision of policing in America.

On Monday, Congressional Democrats introduced the most sweeping federal plan to reform the police in modern memory.

Never again should the world be subjected to witnessing what we saw on the streets in Minneapolis — the slow murder of an individual by a uniformed police officer.

The legislation would reduce the legal protections that now shield police officers accused of misconduct from being prosecuted, and would impose new restrictions to prevent police officers from using deadly force. The measure is expected to quickly pass in the House, where there’s a Democratic majority, but faces an uncertain future in the Republican-controlled Senate. Meanwhile, state-level reforms continue. On Monday, New York’s legislature banned the use of chokeholds by police and repealed a statute that effectively hid the disciplinary records of police officers.

And —

Almost 7 million cases of Covid-19 have now been reported to W.H.O., and almost 400,000 deaths. Although the situation in Europe is improving, globally, it’s worsening.

The World Health Organization said that the number of new daily infections from the coronavirus hit a record high — more than 136,000 on Sunday — and warned that mass protests in places like the U.S. could further spread the virus.

We encourage all those protesting around the world to do so safely. Clean your hands, cover your cough and wear a mask if you attend a protest.

Finally, the National Bureau of Economic Research said that because of the pandemic, the United States economy officially entered a recession in February, ending the longest economic expansion on record. It began in 2009 and lasted 128 months.



That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. My colleague Caitlin Dickerson will host the show tomorrow.

Nine members of the Minneapolis City Council pledged at a rally to dismantle the Police Department. They promised to create a new system of public safety, saying that the city’s current policing system could not be reformed. Council members say they are not certain what policing will look like once they are finished, and they caution plans will take a long time to carry out."
Other Protests Flare and Fade. Why This Movement Already Seems Different.,"DENVER — Ever since people across the country began pouring into the streets to protest police violence, Dakota Patton has driven two hours each day to rally on the steps of the Colorado State Capitol. He has given up his gig jobs delivering food and painting houses. He is exhausted. But he has no plans to leave.

“This is bigger,” Mr. Patton, 24, said. “I’m not worried about anything else I could be doing. I want to and need to be here. As long as I need.”

As Monday marks two full weeks since the first protest sparked by the killing of George Floyd, the massive gatherings for racial justice across the country and now the world have achieved a scale and level of momentum not seen in decades. And they appear unlikely to run out anytime soon.

Streets and public plazas are filled with people who have scrapped weekend plans, canceled meetings, taken time off from work and hastily called babysitters. Many say the economic devastation of the coronavirus had already cleared their schedules. With jobs lost and colleges shuttered, they have nothing but time.

“This feels like home to me,” said Rebecca Agwu, 19, who lost her campus job in the pandemic. She spent five days at the Denver protests, and spent a recent afternoon chatting in the shade of the boarded-up Capitol building with three other women who had been laid off from their mall jobs.

On Sunday, as protesters continued gathering around the country, their growing influence was apparent as local leaders vowed to curb the power of the police.

Mayor Bill de Blasio pledged to cut the budget for the New York Police Department and spend more on social services in the city. In Minneapolis, nine City Council members — a veto-proof majority — publicly promised to create a new system of public safety in a city where law enforcement has long been accused of racism.

Mr. de Blasio also canceled the nightly curfew that he imposed last week. And President Trump said on Sunday that he had ordered National Guard troops to begin withdrawing from Washington.

Raids and arrests broke up protest encampments over an oil pipeline in North Dakota near the Standing Rock reservation and at the heart of Occupy Wall Street in years past. But protesters now say that aggressive responses by the police are only reinforcing their commitment to return to the streets. After police last week used flash grenades and a chemical spray to clear peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square in front of the White House, even more people began showing up.

One recent afternoon in Washington, D.C., one person among hundreds of demonstrators shouted that they would all be coming back the following day. Another person added, “and the next day.” The phrase caught fire, and the crowd started chanting, “And the next day! And the next day!”

“If I’m the next hashtag, hopefully people will be out here for me too,” said Andrew Jackson, a 25-year-old government contractor who has joined protesters in Washington.

Mr. Jackson said his own experiences of police abuse had compelled him to cut back on his work hours and join the rallies: An officer once pointed a gun at his head, and the son of a neighbor had been shot and killed by the police, he said.

“I’ll come out day after day after day,” Mr. Jackson said.

Because the protests are not only about the death of Mr. Floyd but a broader system of racial inequality, officials cannot simply defuse concerns by pressing charges against police officers, as they did in Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray.

In Minneapolis, activists said they did not believe the movement would lose steam simply because the officer who knelt on Mr. Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds and three others who were at the scene had now been charged.

“I’ve been attending protests as far back as I can remember,” said Raeisha Williams, who brought her toddler son along to a protest she helped organize last week in downtown Minneapolis. “And I plan to keep attending them until the system actually changes.”

People around the world — in Australia, Britain, France, Germany and beyond — have defied cold weather and public health rules against mass gatherings to show solidarity with American protesters, who have now taken to the streets in more than 150 cities.

Activists and scholars who have studied the crest and fall of other upwellings over police killings, school shootings, women’s rights and immigration detentions say that the widespread outrage over economic and racial injustices may give the new movement a greater durability.

“There was a wash, rinse, repeat cycle, a standard script,” said Jody David Armour, a law professor at the University of Southern California who studies racial justice. “Convene a commission, hold some hearings, have community members vent and testify, and here come some policymakers saying, ‘Here’s a fix.’ ”

The result, he said: “Look where we are.”

Nekima Levy Armstrong, another organizer in Minneapolis, changed her life to be able to march on the streets. Ms. Armstrong, a civil rights lawyer and former president of the Minneapolis chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., was a professor of law at the University of St. Thomas in Minneapolis. But she quit in 2016 to be able to fully devote herself to the civil-rights movement and protesting. She even ran unsuccessfully for mayor.

“My entire life has changed since taking to the streets,” she said.

On Wednesday, shortly after charges against the four officers in the Floyd case were announced, she rallied more than 500 people, carrying placards with slogans like “Black Lives Matter More Than Windows” and “4 Killer Cops 4 Convictions.” She said the officers could be tried by an all-white jury; they could be acquitted.

“We have to continue to be vigilant. We can’t rest,” she told the crowd, her voice rising. She added: “We got to keep marching. Keep demonstrating. Keep speaking the truth. Keep protesting.”

The crowd, in front of the TV station where the wife of the head of the police union works as an anchor, erupted in cheers and applause.

Community organizers say that some of the energy now coursing through the street will eventually ebb.

But they say the Floyd protests appear to be creating a new generation of activism out of deep, widespread anger. There is outrage: At police killings of black men and women. At economic inequality when 13 percent of Americans are out of work. At failed political leadership during a pandemic that has killed more than 100,000 Americans.

“You’re watching injustice take place in every sector of our society,” said Wes Moore, who chronicles Freddie Gray’s death and its aftermath in the book, “Five Days.” “Schools have been closed. Students are burdened and under debt. There’s a compounding to the pain.”

In South Florida, activists said they were trying to sustain the energy of this moment by signing up volunteers, holding trainings and making sure people had a ride or gas money to get to the multiple daily protests that are happening.

“In the past we have seen where momentum would have gone away, but now we are seeing people want to know how to plan protests,” said Tifanny Burks, a member of the Black Lives Matter Alliance in Broward County, Fla. “I see a shift.”

Asa Rogers-Shaw, 30, a Black Lives Matter activist in Fort Lauderdale, said he does not protest every day. He is focusing his efforts now on crafting strategies to ensure that the protesters have tools to sustain the protest. Organizers in Broward County held a virtual training Wednesday night to teach protesters to continue their activism through “direct actions.” More than 200 people signed up.

“If you cover the arc of these moments, you know the energy is going to dissipate eventually,” Mr. Rogers-Shaw said. “ It’s how much of that residue can we hold on to.”

Activists across the country say that while the news media may pay attention when buildings burn or another black person is killed, their protests and calls for reforms have never ceased.

In Ferguson, Mo., where Michael Brown, a black 18-year-old, was shot dead by a white police officer in 2014, residents and Black Lives Matter activists have spent nearly six years working to change the city’s courts, police policies and political leadership. Last week, Ferguson elected its first African-American mayor, Ella Jones.

In Baltimore, the family of Tyrone West, who died after a struggle with the police in 2013, has gathered in the street every Wednesday to call for justice in his death and commemorate victims of police brutality.

In Los Angeles, Black Lives Matter activists have demonstrated downtown against police abuses every Wednesday for more than two years, often drawing just a couple of dozen people. But last week, thousands came, underscoring how the outrage at Mr. Floyd’s killing has catalyzed the work that local activists have been carrying out for years.

Valerie Rivera, whose son Eric was killed by police in 2017, said she was glad the others were joining her.

“We have been waiting for these days to come, for these people to stream into these streets,” she said.

"After Protests, Politicians Reconsider Police Budgets and Discipline","MINNEAPOLIS — In an abrupt change of course, the mayor of New York vowed to cut the budget of the nation’s largest police force. In Los Angeles, the mayor called for redirecting millions of dollars from policing after protesters gathered outside his home. And in Minneapolis, City Council members pledged to dismantle their police force and completely reinvent how public safety is handled. As tens of thousands of people have demonstrated against police violence over the past two weeks, calls have emerged in cities across the country for fundamental changes to American policing.

The pleas for change have taken a variety of forms — including measures to restrict police use of military-style equipment and efforts to require officers to face strict discipline in cases of misconduct. Parks, universities and schools have distanced themselves from local police departments, severing contracts. In some places, the calls for change have gone still further, aiming to abolish police departments, shift police funds into social services or defund police departments partly or entirely.

“It is a critical time that we can see concrete change,” said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who last week addressed the crowd gathered for a memorial service for George Floyd, the black man who died after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes in Minneapolis last month. “The legislation and the policy changes will be the ones that determine the victory of this movement.”

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”



Today, several major U.S. cities are now proposing ways to defund and even dismantle their police departments. John Eligon on the thinking behind those plans and what they might look like in practice.

It’s Tuesday, June 9.

(CHANTING) I can’t breathe! I can’t breathe!

In the early days of the protests after George Floyd was killed —

(CHANTING) No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace!

— it was just pure emotions and raw rage.

[EXPLETIVE] these racist [EXPLETIVE] police!

But pretty soon, once the more fiery protests and fiery unrest died down, then we started seeing the organizers come in and talking about what they want. And one thing we quickly saw were these face masks that people were wearing. They were black, and they had yellow writing on them. And they said, “Defund police.”

Hmm.

And from there, you start hearing these calls at protest, at rallies.

(CHANTING) Defund the police! Defund the police!

You start hearing, “Defund the police.”

You start hearing calls to abolish the police. You start seeing people waving signs. And it became clear that this was an opening that a lot of activists saw to take this moment of a very brutal police killing and turn it into something much larger.

Do the right thing!

Defund the police!

So John, what do these concepts — defund, dismantle, abolish the police — what exactly do they mean?

To defund, when activists say that, what they mean is taking money away from the police department’s budget and redirect it toward other things — whether that be social services, agencies, maybe mental health agencies — that can do functions that police are often called on to do.

Mm-hmm.

But if you fully defund it, you can get to a space where the police department is abolished. And so essentially, what that means is that there is no more police department as we know it. You don’t call these men and women in blue shirts to come racing to your door with their guns in hand. It means that they have to figure out some other form of providing that public safety, and the police department would not be that form.

And where did these concepts come from?

Well, at their core, they come from the problems and issues that especially communities of color, especially black communities, have had with policing. They see police coming into their communities to brutalize them, not to protect and serve them. And that has really influenced this desire to keep the police away, to do something else. And we’ve seen, basically, that governments and police forces, they respond with certain reforms. We’ve seen efforts for body cameras. We’ve seen diversifying the police departments. We’ve seen changes to the rules on use of force.

Mm-hmm.

But what became clear to a lot of today’s activists, and what they say explicitly, is that these reforms are not working. If you look at since Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Missouri six years ago, the police have continued to kill people at high rates, and especially black people at disproportionately high rates. And so for them, the only solution is to tear it down and build something new.

So John, what might it actually look like in practice to defund or abolish a police department?

So for instance, if someone is homeless and they’re struggling on the streets, a person can call 9-1-1, and instead of an armed police officer being sent out, perhaps there can be an outreach worker from a homeless services agency. Or if you have someone having a mental health episode, then again, you can call 9-1-1, and instead of a police officer, maybe a health care worker, a mental health worker will come out. And the idea behind it is to really cut down the interactions between armed police officers and civilians. And by doing that, the hope is that it will reduce their conflict and the potential for people getting hurt or killed by police officers.

Right. I mean, that makes a certain sense, especially for a community where there’s not a lot of violent crime. But every community is different, right? And some towns, some cities — I think about New York City, for example — have a significantly higher rate of violent crime that would seem to require having armed police. So how do activists think about that?

For a lot of the activists that I spoke to, the issue was about centering public safety on communities. And one activist that I spoke to, Arianna Nason, she said essentially it’s going to be up to each community to decide what public safety looks like for itself.

It’s going to be up to every community to decide what they need. We can’t decide that.

So maybe that’s armed patrols. Maybe that’s mental health workers. Maybe that’s some sort of mobile units with social workers sitting in it, and people are trained in using force and different things. One of the big ideas is this idea of community policing, community watch. And it’s interesting. I had said isn’t an issue, though, with community policing or community patrols, neighborhood watch, that if I walk into that community, as a black man with dreadlocks, if I walk into one of these communities, we see what happens with neighborhood watch. We see Trayvon Martin. We see Ahmaud Arbery.

Should that be a concern, then? I guess with this community-type based model that certain people who look a certain way might go into the neighborhood, and that community might decide to take it into their own hands and then take it overboard, I guess.

And she took off her sunglasses. She looked at me, and she said —

No, I get that. And I’ll be really real with you. For me, personally, I don’t have all the answers for that. I don’t. And I wish I did. A lot of it is —

Honestly, I don’t really know the answer to that right now.

Huh.

She was not sure exactly what the answer was. And see, this is all to say, it’s still very tricky and very much a work in progress. But what she did say is that the current system also is not working for me either. So it’s a matter of what are they going to do differently? And they believe that something drastically different needs to be done.

Mm-hmm. As best you can tell, would any of the familiar elements of an existing police department — I’m thinking, for the sake of argument, homicide detectives, special victims units that investigate sexual assault or rape — do those remain? Do they take a different form? Do they adopt a different name? Has that been fleshed out?

I would say, no, it’s not been fleshed out. Because again, we go back to the fact that this is not going to be some federal commission, or even state commission or a city commission for anywhere that’s going to come up with, like, these are the rules for public safety now. And these are all things that need to be worked out. And I think what people say with things like homicide investigations, with sex crimes investigations and things like that, they say a couple of things. One, the police are not doing a good job at those anyways. So you have lots of cities where the clearance rate on homicides and other investigations is miserable. You had, even here in Minneapolis, there was a big scandal with all the rape kits that they had untested. So they had a lot of issues with crimes that were not being investigated properly. And then, the second thing that people say is that those jobs can be taken up by specialized, trained people. You can build new institutions to do those things that aren’t necessary policing. I did talk to one council member who said, maybe there’s still police, but for very, very limited role, and many of their responsibilities are farmed out. You know, anything short of some sort of active violence, you don’t need police for. So in some people’s eyes, that would still be a police force. But one thing that the people who are most ardent about abolishing the police or defunding the police, even, they make it clear that they don’t just want a system in which it’s police in another name, police with another uniform on.



And these demands to defund the police, they’ve actually been brewing in Minneapolis for several years now. Ever since a police killing back in 2015, there’s been several local activist groups working on it. And those activist groups came together this past weekend in what was probably the biggest and most clearest demand for defunding the police.

We’ll be right back.

(CHANTING) Abolish the M.P.D.!

So there were hundreds of activists who went and gathered in front of the mayor Jacob Frey’s house.

Abolish the M.P.D.! And they had a megaphone. They were chanting. They were screaming. And sure enough, the mayor came out to talk to the protesters. He kind of made his way through the crowd, walked up to the front, and you had one of the lead organizers for a group called the Black Visions Collective. Kandace Montgomery, she was standing up on a riser there, talking down in a megaphone to the mayor.

Jacob Frey, we have a yes-or-no question for you. Yes or no, will you commit to defunding Minneapolis Police Department?

[INAUDIBLE]

And you could tell, like, there is this hesitation because he knows this is not going to go well, right? You have all these very vocal, very ardent activists around you who want you to defund the police.

Will you defund the Minneapolis Police Department?

[CROWD MURMURING]

All right, be quiet y’all. Be quiet, because it’s important that we actually hear this. It’s important that we hear this, because if y’all don’t know, he’s up for re-election next year.

[CROWD CHEERING]

And then —

I do not support the full abolition of the police department.

All right!

You’re wasting our time! Get the [EXPLETIVE] out of here!

And he gives his answer — he does not support full abolition of the police.

(CHANTING) Go home, Jacob, go home! Go home, Jacob, go home!

And he turns around, and he just kind of walked off into the sea of people.

(CHANTING) Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame!

So after this event, there was already an event planned for the following day by some of these same activists organizations, in which they were going to bring council members who were supportive of their cause onto a stage in a park in the Southern part of the city. And they were going to try to get them to make a commitment to defunding the police.

So a lot like what they had done to the mayor?

Exactly.

Hi, Minneapolis. You look so beautiful today. I’m Lisa Bender. I’m the president of the Minneapolis City Council.

And so we had this gathering where there were hundreds of residents.

Our efforts at incremental reform have failed. Period.

And you had council members.

Our commitment is to do what’s necessary to keep every single member of our community safe, and to tell the truth that the Minneapolis Police are not doing that. [CROWD CHEERS]

And you had nine of them who went up on the stage.

We are here today to begin the process of ending the Minneapolis Police Department. [CROWD CHEERS]

And then all nine of them each read a part pledging to defend the police.

All of us on this stage support this statement, and we stand with the people of Minneapolis in fighting for a safer community. [CROWD CHEERS]

The last council member, he basically said, and we are all committing to this pledge. And at that moment, it was like this emotional eruption.

[INAUDIBLE], get up, y’all. We are transforming our city right now. Get up! get

You had white people, black people, Asian people, all putting their fists in the air, shouting, defund the police, defund police.

(CHANTING) Defund M.P.D.! Defund M.P.D.! Defund M.P.D.!

So just to be clear, this is not a vote, and not necessarily even a pledge to vote, but this is a public commitment to defund the police — to do the very thing that the mayor, when asked, declined to agree to 24 hours before.

Yes, exactly. This is a pledge that they are going to defund the police. It is not a vote. It is not anything set in stone or written. But these are putting them all on record in front of many community members, saying that we are going to do this. And I even asked the activists about that. I said, we’ve heard politicians say things before and not keep those pledges. But this is something that they saw they’ve been working on with them together in tandem. So I think there’s a level of trust there that this pledge has really meant something. And you could see it in the reaction of the people who were there. They were really describing it as their Civil Rights Movement, their Voting Rights Act moment.

Wow. And John, can the members of the City Council who were in that park, making this pledge, do they have the actual authority to take away funding from the police department?

Yes, they absolutely have voting authority to do that. The council actually controls the police department’s budget. And what’s more significant about this moment is that because there were nine of them, those nine seats represents a veto-proof majority. So even if the mayor, Jacob Frey, does not want this to happen, if that coalition sticks together, they can do this on their own. And I think what we’re seeing is this sentiment is growing in traction in certain places. Like we already have in New York and Los Angeles, the mayors in both of those cities have already said that they are going to be redirecting funds that were intended for the police toward other parts of the city, toward other agencies in the city.

I’m curious what the appetite for this kind of change to policing is, beyond the cities where there are largely Democratic city councils and mayors, and where this is now under discussion.

That’s a very key question, right? We’re already seeing conservatives coming out against this and talking about this is as very radical leftist step to be taking. We see Donald Trump already tweeting about it. So certainly, this is something that, for conservative communities, something like this would be a tougher sell. And so again, policing is a very local thing. So what you experience and what the police force does or does not look like in Minneapolis is going to be very different than what it does or does not look like in Edina, which is just outside of Minneapolis, or any other suburb. So it’s going to be, in some ways, a patchwork of public safety, I think, if these things start happening around the country.

And I guess an open question is whether or not this has entered the mainstream, even of the Democratic Party. Just a few hours before you and I began to talk, Joe Biden came out and said he does not support defunding the police.

Yeah, this is certainly not something that is part of the mainstream or moderate Democratic platform. That said, you do get some people who might be in these more moderate spaces, you do get their attention and you do get their ear, is this sense that policing is not working — which is just the basis of what these defund or abolish the police efforts are about, is that the system is not working. And so you will get even the more moderate folks to say that, to buy into that. And that may not result in them supporting a defund or abolishment, but will it support more stringent reforms, more significant reforms to police? So we’ll see what happens.

I wonder how the activists that you’re talking to see the challenge of explaining what these concepts are going to mean. Because in this moment, I think many Americans are really hearing these calls — defund, dismantle, abolish — for the first time. And they may be very wary of them, and they may see them as quite radical.

What the activists will tell you is that while it might sound radical for many Americans, this actually is not all that radical for a large section of this country.

What was your name, sir?

Yaazirah

How do you spell that?

Y-A-H- —

If you go to black and brown communities — like I went up to the North Side of Minneapolis — and you talk to people about their experiences with the police there, it is not the experience of expecting an officer to come and help you. It’s exactly the opposite. And I was speaking with a couple there, Amanda and Yaazirah Brazelton.

It’s about time for a change.

A change, yeah.

Yeah. About time for a change.

And they were telling me that from a young age, essentially, they already had horrific experiences with the police.

[INAUDIBLE] I have police put guns in my face, you know, at seven years old, coming to my house with my mother and my father arguing, just regular argument that happens with a husband and wife.

Yaazirah, he was seven years old when the police came to his house when his parents were having an argument.

And they put guns in my face and put us all on the ground.

And then they stuck a gun in his face.

They traumatized me in childhood, so I was really against white police officers since.

And his wife Amanda, she was 14 when she was in a car with white people, and she’s black.

We were driving in the car. All my white friends got out. And as soon as I got out, they pulled guns, yelled at —

And when they were pulled over, the cops let the white people out, but then they pulled guns on her.

I’m 14 years old, in the backseat of the car, not doing nothing wrong. And that was my first real incident with the police in that interaction.

And so the way they see the police department is not a force where you call and then an Officer Friendly shows up.

Man, I got a houseful of kids that are scared of the police because of what they’ve seen.

It’s one where Amanda recalled her children have already had run-ins with the police that when someone was breaking into their house once, she didn’t call the police, but she called family and friends.

And I called him. I called my brother. I called my uncle. I called my dad, my mom, before called the police.

Why didn’t you call the police?

Because they kill black people. They’ll call me, I’ll get killed in my own home.

So it’s already a lived experience, a lived reality for people in many black communities, that the police are essentially a force that only exists, in their eyes, to harass them, to brutalize them and not to protect them. And what the activists hope is that people who are scared that abolishing police will suddenly lead to a breakdown in their communities and just rampant violence, they’re saying, no, this will create outcomes that will make the community safer and better, not just for affluent white communities, but for all communities across the country. And so what activists are asking is that people who see this as a radical idea, who can’t envision a world without police, they’re asking them to just walk in these people’s shoes, understand what they’re going through.



John, thank you very much.

Thank you.

The nine members of the city council that came from every corner of our city to stand together to make this commitment, we don’t have all the answers.

In an interview on Monday, the president of the Minneapolis City Council, one of the nine members who has pledged to defund the city’s police department, acknowledged that implementing the plan would likely take years.

And if you look back at the last 150 years of our police department, it is becoming increasingly clear that that model of policing isn’t working. I hope it won’t take 150 years to get to that looking forward, that next solution. But we have a lot of wisdom in our community. We have invested in [INAUDIBLE] —



We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today.

Good morning, everyone. The Justice in Policing Act establishes a bold, transformative vision of policing in America.

On Monday, Congressional Democrats introduced the most sweeping federal plan to reform the police in modern memory.

Never again should the world be subjected to witnessing what we saw on the streets in Minneapolis — the slow murder of an individual by a uniformed police officer.

The legislation would reduce the legal protections that now shield police officers accused of misconduct from being prosecuted, and would impose new restrictions to prevent police officers from using deadly force. The measure is expected to quickly pass in the House, where there’s a Democratic majority, but faces an uncertain future in the Republican-controlled Senate. Meanwhile, state-level reforms continue. On Monday, New York’s legislature banned the use of chokeholds by police and repealed a statute that effectively hid the disciplinary records of police officers.

And —

Almost 7 million cases of Covid-19 have now been reported to W.H.O., and almost 400,000 deaths. Although the situation in Europe is improving, globally, it’s worsening.

The World Health Organization said that the number of new daily infections from the coronavirus hit a record high — more than 136,000 on Sunday — and warned that mass protests in places like the U.S. could further spread the virus.

We encourage all those protesting around the world to do so safely. Clean your hands, cover your cough and wear a mask if you attend a protest.

Finally, the National Bureau of Economic Research said that because of the pandemic, the United States economy officially entered a recession in February, ending the longest economic expansion on record. It began in 2009 and lasted 128 months.



That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. My colleague Caitlin Dickerson will host the show tomorrow.

Democrats in Congress on Monday unveiled legislation aimed at ending excessive use of force by the police and making it easier to identify, track and prosecute police misconduct. The measures were seen as the most expansive intervention into policing that federal lawmakers have proposed in recent memory.

The legislation would curtail protections that shield police officers accused of misconduct from being prosecuted and would set restrictions aimed at barring officers from using deadly force except as a last resort. The fate of the measures was far from certain; they were expected to pass swiftly in the Democratic-led House, but President Trump and Republican lawmakers have yet to signal what measures, if any, they would accept. The legislation under consideration does not contemplate defunding police departments and falls short of what many protesters have demanded.

For his part, Mr. Trump on Monday discarded proposals to remove funds from police departments. “We won’t be defunding our police,” he said. “We won’t be dismantling our police.” His attorney general, William P. Barr, said that it would be wrong to reduce police budgets in part because he felt the country needed more policing to preserve public safety, and warned that the nation would see “chaos” and “more killings” should any major city disband its department.



Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, “does not believe that police should be defunded,” a campaign spokesman said on Monday, adding that Mr. Biden “supports the urgent need for reform” as well as financial support for community policing programs.

Around the country, city and state leaders were weighing overhauls of their policing policies, aware of the delicate balance of voters’ concerns about crime versus their repulsion at police brutality.

In Albany, New York State lawmakers on Monday began passing a wide-ranging package of bills targeting police misconduct, overcoming deep-seated opposition from law enforcement unions. The measures, many of which have languished for years, include a ban on the use of chokeholds as well as the repeal of a decades-old statute that has effectively hidden the disciplinary records of police officers from public view.

Last week, a City Council budget meeting in Nashville stretched on for more than eight hours, coming to a close well after midnight as residents organized by a coalition of community groups lined up to demand that the police budget be cut.

The idea of removing money from police forces, once largely put forth for years by academics and advocacy groups, appeared to be shifting into the spotlight, as activists and elected officials in cities like Nashville, Portland, Ore., and Denver weighed the possibility.

“This is totally new,” said Stacie Gilmore, City Council member for a largely Latino and African-American district in Denver who had received 2,500 emails in the past three days demanding the city defund the police. “We’re always scrambling to get enough resources. Our Police Department by default serves as social worker, therapist, family counselor, career counselor. We don’t need the police to do that job anymore. It’s not working for communities of color.”

Late last week, after several days of protests, Mayor Ted Wheeler of Portland announced an end to school resource officers, freeing up $1 million to be used elsewhere with community input, according to Tim Becker, a spokesman for the mayor.

Around the country, the calls from activists and other leaders for defunding police departments have taken on different meanings in different places. Most pleas for defunding the police do not signal a wish to end efforts at public safety. Rather, officials say they want to stop spending millions of dollars on certain items for the police, such as military-style equipment. Some proposals seek to trim the number of officers, a prospect that could force a debate over union contracts.

The end goal, advocates say, is to put an end to horrific scenes like the death of Mr. Floyd in Minneapolis.

In that city, council members took a first major step toward dismantling its police force on Sunday when nine of them, a veto-proof majority, pledged to revamp policing. Specifics were uncertain but council members promised to listen to concerns from community groups and cautioned changes would take time.

“We’re reclaiming the conversation of public safety and we’re saying, ‘It doesn’t have to be fear-based, it doesn’t have to be punishment-based,’” said Alondra Cano, a council member.

Other lawmakers and leaders say defunding police departments could have unintended consequences. Some people worry about safety if fewer armed officers are on patrol, especially in summer months when crime rates tend to spike.

Jim Cooper, a Democratic state legislator in California, urged cities to proceed with caution when they consider cutting police budgets.

“You still have bad people out there who do bad things,” said Mr. Cooper, who spent 30 years in law enforcement. “And most of the crime is in underserved neighborhoods, not in SoHo or Beverly Hills.”

After 10 nights of mass protests and several videos documenting police violence in New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday vowed to cut an unspecified amount from the New York Police Department’s $6 billion budget and redirect it toward youth and other social programs.

Earlier, Mr. de Blasio had expressed substantial skepticism about the wisdom of cutting police funding, even as he acknowledged that all agencies might face cuts should the federal government fail to come through with more coronavirus relief.

In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti last week agreed to redirect $150 million from the Police Department’s nearly $2 billion budget and other city programs to health and education programs among others. The move came after calls from members of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles and the City Council.

Officials from police unions have pushed back against the idea with sharp rebukes in some cases. In Los Angeles, the union issued a statement saying that a crisis response team should be sent to the mayor “because Eric has apparently lost his damn mind.” Union members warned that spending cuts would lead to more crime.

In Minneapolis, police have used force against black people at a rate at least seven times as often as they have against white people over the past five years, according to the city’s data.

That statistic helps explain why the idea of abolishing the police force makes sense to some African-Americans. Some black people say police departments have not served to protect their communities, but rather to harass and brutalize them. Amanda Brazelton, a resident of Minneapolis’s predominantly black North Side, said she supported using money that now goes to the police to instead create community-led safety efforts.

Ms. Brazelton said negative interactions with the police started when she was 14 and riding in a car that was pulled over. The officers did nothing when her white friends got out, she said. But when she stepped out of the car, the officers pulled weapons on her and yelled.

Now, if there is an issue at her home or she feels in danger, Ms. Brazelton, a 30-year-old caterer, said she would call friends or family before the police.

“As crazy as it seems, it could be something for the better,” Ms. Brazelton said of abolishing the police. “They kill black people.”

There is a difference between defunding the police and abolishing the police, said Arianna Nason, a member of the MPD150 Collective, a coalition of community activists in Minneapolis.

She envisions a city where community watch groups or app-based safety groups could respond to crimes.

The prospect that neighborhood watch groups could stereotype and endanger people of color is also a concern among some people. Ms. Nason said she understood that, but that danger already existed in the current system.

“A lot of it is a leap of faith,” she said. “I want to choose to believe in humanity. I want to choose to believe that this moment feels different because it is different.”

The Long History of the ‘Outside Agitator’,"After demonstrations for racial equality in Alabama were inflamed by the killing of Jimmie Lee Jackson, 26, a black activist who was shot by a state trooper, state officials issued a resolution asking people to stay home, citing “continued agitation and demonstrations led and directed by outsiders.”

The resolution was signed by Gov. George Wallace 55 years ago, and the demonstrations it referred to included a series of marches from Selma to Montgomery, one of which ended on March 7, 1965 — now known as Bloody Sunday — with state troopers attacking the marchers with billy clubs and tear gas.

The wording of the resolution, which suggested that the demonstrations did not involve or were not supported by Alabama residents, was typical of the time.

“The notion — or rather fiction — of the ‘outside agitator’ was a persistent trope, especially during the early years of the civil rights movement,” said Thomas C. Holt, 77, a professor of African-American history at the University of Chicago who helped organize demonstrations during the 1960s.

“Part of the motivations for the charge was to sustain the myth that the locals were satisfied with things as they were,” he said, “and if you could just crack down on the outsiders, the protests would cease. As the movement grew and spread, that myth became more difficult to sustain.”

But the concept of “outside agitators” in popular protests has persisted, in part because it is rooted in some truth: Then as now, activists and leaders traveled from city to city to help organize demonstrations or mutual aid programs. Freedom riders took buses across state lines to protest segregation. The civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., who was from Atlanta, traveled frequently and was regularly labeled an outsider by local officials.

Charlene A. Carruthers, 34, an organizer and the author of “Unapologetic: A Black, Queer and Feminist Mandate for Radical Movements,” has worked with demonstrators in Ferguson, Mo.; Baltimore; Chicago; and Charlotte, N.C. She has heard officials evoke the threat of outsider influence multiple times over her 15 years in activism.

But she said it has not deterred demonstrators across the United States — including first-time protesters and people from different backgrounds — from “rising up in grief and anger” over police killings of black people.

Last month, George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man from Minneapolis, died after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes. In many cities, the ensuing peaceful demonstrations against police brutality have sometimes coincided with looting and property damage, typically after dark. Some demonstrators have voiced concerns about protesters — as well as possible infiltrators — who destroy property or distract from peaceful gatherings.

These modern demonstrations differ from past movements because they are more geographically, racially and ideologically diverse, said Robin D.G. Kelley, a historian of social movements at the University of California, Los Angeles, adding that some internal discord is unavoidable.

“There’s hardly a movement in the last 50 years that hasn’t had some tension or antagonism between those whose tactics are perceived as being destructive or aggressive, and those whose tactics are seen as disobedient but peaceful,” he said.

Recently, misinformation and conspiracy theories about the protests have flourished online. President Trump has tweeted about the influence of “the Radical Left, looters and thugs,” and threatened to use the Insurrection Act of 1807 to deploy active-duty troops against protesters.

And while there is some evidence that fringe groups have tried to discredit the movement, there is little evidence behind the suggestions from some federal officials that members of antifa — a contraction of the term “anti-fascist” that is associated with a diffuse movement of protesters who sometimes engage in techniques like vandalism — are driving the looting and violence.

In this confusing landscape, it is worth remembering how officials have used rhetoric about infiltration to justify forceful responses to popular movements, Dr. Holt said.

“There can be little doubt that the Trump administration is using the ‘outsider’ ploy much as segregationists did in the 1960s, to justify extreme measures against all of the protesters under that guise,” he said. “As then, tear gas and rubber bullets don’t distinguish between natives and visitors.”

During the civil rights movement, the term “outside agitator” often implied links to communism, which officials used as a boogeyman to distract from demonstrators’ demands for basic human rights.

There were some black communists in the South, as there had been for decades before the civil rights movement, said Dr. Kelley of U.C.L.A. He added that claims of outside agitation stemmed in part from the racist notion that insurrectionary ideas had to come from somewhere else because black people in the South could not come up with them on their own.

Several officials — including the segregationist Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and Sheriff Jim Clark of Dallas County, Ala. — labeled Dr. King an outsider, a charge he addressed in his “Letter from Birmingham Jail” in 1963.

“Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial ‘outside agitator’ idea,” Dr. King wrote. “Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.”

In 1968, when state troopers in South Carolina shot and killed three black students who were demonstrating for integration, an episode known as the Orangeburg Massacre, Gov. Robert E. McNair blamed “black power” activists for inciting the protest. In 1970, the year members of the Ohio National Guard shot and killed student demonstrators at Kent State University in Ohio, the Nixon administration sought to blame outsiders or rioters for fanning the flames of anti-Vietnam sentiment.

Claims about the influence of “outsiders” have been a common refrain around demonstrations of all types ever since. This has been particularly true of protests against police misconduct.

In 2014, officials warned of outside influence when people protested the police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. In 2015, when demonstrators gathered in Baltimore after Freddie Gray died in police custody, the police described “pockets of people from out of town causing disturbances.” And shortly after protests erupted in Minnesota last month, officials claimed that the people arrested were mostly from out of state — and then walked back those comments.

Ms. Carruthers said that claims of outsider influence have not drowned out the demands of demonstrators. “People are calling for divestment and defunding of the police, and for investments in our communities,” she said.

“Yes, people from other cities and states come in,” she added. “And yes, we also see white supremacists or infiltrators trying to push our message off course. But overwhelmingly the people who are showing up are people who see what is happening in their communities and saying: This is not OK.”"
Barr Says There Is No Systemic Racism in Policing,"WASHINGTON — Attorney General William P. Barr said on Sunday that he did not believe racism was a systemic problem in policing, echoing other top administration officials’ defense of an important part of President Trump’s base as protests against police killings of unarmed black people continued across the nation.

“I don’t think that the law enforcement system is systemically racist,” Mr. Barr said in an interview with the CBS program “Face the Nation.” “I think we have to recognize that for most of our history, our institutions were explicitly racist.”

Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, made similar remarks on Sunday in an interview with “This Week” on ABC, saying that “systemic racism” was not an issue for law enforcement.

Their defense mirrored comments made last week by the national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien, and came as the protests over the killing of George Floyd last month and racial injustice in policing continued to gain momentum. Nearly a decade ago, the killings of unarmed black people — including Trayvon Martin, a teenager in Florida who was shot while walking home from the store — planted the seeds for the Black Lives Matter movement, which protests racial profiling, racial inequality in the nation’s prisons and policing issues, including excessive use of force.

Mr. Barr and Mr. Wolf spoke the day before the president was scheduled to meet with local, state and federal law enforcement officials at the White House.

Mr. Trump, who has declared himself “your president of law and order,” needs the continued support of police officers and sheriffs — especially now that he has weakened in the polls — and evangelical Christians, another crucial part of his base. A handful of top Republicans have also said that they will not support him in the upcoming election.

Both Mr. Barr and Mr. Wolf condemned the death of Mr. Floyd as a tragedy, and the attorney general said he understood why black people in the United States distrusted law enforcement given “the history in this country.”

Mr. Barr reiterated comments he made during a news conference on Thursday, when he said that it was “undeniable that many African-Americans lack confidence in the American criminal justice system” and that “nothing less is acceptable” than equal protection under the law.

But he said that work done since the 1960s to reform racist institutions more broadly “is working and progress has been made.” In his view, he said, police brutality against black people was the work of a few bad apples.

To that end, Mr. Barr told CBS that he did not support reducing the amount of immunity officers have when someone dies in their custody. Such a change, he said, would “result certainly in police pulling back.”

“I frankly think that we have generally the vast, overwhelming majority of police are good people,” Mr. Barr said. “I think that there are instances of bad cops. And I think we have to be careful about automatically assuming that the actions of an individual necessarily mean that their organization is rotten.”

While Mr. Barr flatly denied there was systemic racism in policing, he compared law enforcement to the military, which he said “used to be an explicitly racist institution.”

“Now I think it’s in the vanguard of bringing the races together and providing equal opportunity,” Mr. Barr said. “I think law enforcement has been going through the same process.”

During the Trump administration, the Justice Department has pulled back on the tools it had used in the past to combat police abuses, including consent decrees that impose a rehabilitation program onto police forces. It has also allowed police departments to receive grant money without filling out as much paperwork to show the results of their policing work.

This has made some activists and black community leaders wary of the department’s ability and willingness to curb police abuses. It has also led them to worry about how it will handle the federal civil rights investigation into the officer who knelt for nearly nine minutes on the neck of Mr. Floyd, an unarmed motorist, before he died on May 25.

Since Mr. Floyd’s death, the F.B.I. criminal division has opened 10 investigations into whether law enforcement personnel violated the rights of civilians under color of law, meaning while acting in their capacity as officers of the law, according to an official familiar with the cases who was not authorized to publicly discuss them.

Democrats in Congress have staked out a markedly different position. On Monday, they are expected to announce expansive legislation that makes it easier to prosecute police misconduct. The proposal would also make it easier to recover damages from officers who are found guilty of violating the constitutional rights of civilians and to pressure the Justice Department to address systemic racism in law enforcement.

Falwell’s Blackface Tweet Brings Racial Dissent to Liberty University,"WASHINGTON — The racial strife roiling the country and its politics has reached an unlikely redoubt of social conservatism, Jerry Falwell Jr.’s Liberty University.

Blackface and Ku Klux Klan imagery tweeted by Mr. Falwell, who tolerates little dissent at the evangelical university he leads, has spurred staff resignations, demands for his firing by influential alumni, an incipient boycott and a raucous protest in the university’s home of Lynchburg, Va., over the past week.

So heated was the response that on Monday, Mr. Falwell, the university’s president and a vocal ally of President Trump, did something rare for him in the heat of a controversy: He apologized for a May 27 tweet in which he mocked the social-distancing orders of Virginia’s Democratic governor, Ralph Northam. In that tweet was the image of a mask on which was emblazoned the photo from Mr. Northam’s medical school yearbook of a man in black face and another in Ku Klux Klan robes, one of whom might be Mr. Northam.

“After listening to African-American L.U. leaders and alumni over the past week and hearing their concerns, I understand that by tweeting an image to remind all of the governor’s racist past, I actually refreshed the trauma that image had caused and offended some by using the image to make a political point,” Mr. Falwell said in a statement and on Twitter. “Based on our long relationships, they uniformly understood this was not my intent, but because it was the result, I have deleted the tweet and apologize for any hurt my effort caused, especially within the African-American community.”

It is not clear whether the overture — as much another jab at Mr. Northam as an olive branch to Mr. Falwell’s critics — will defuse the controversy.

“Your actions have shown you really don’t care about the black community, and that’s sad,” Keyvon Scott, an online admissions counselor who had resigned in protest, said upon learning of Mr. Falwell’s apology. “You can’t say this is a Christian university, but then everything that comes out your mouth is about Trump.”

The tweet in question came after months of criticism over Mr. Falwell’s decision to reopen Liberty University after spring break, despite the coronavirus pandemic, and of his mockery of social distancing orders.

“I was adamantly opposed to the mandate from @GovernorVA requiring citizens to wear face masks until I decided to design my own,” Mr. Falwell wrote above the blackface and Klan image. “If I am ordered to wear a mask, I will reluctantly comply, but only if this picture of Governor Blackface himself is on it!”

At least four black faculty and staff members resigned in protest, including Mr. Scott and Quan McLaurin, who was Liberty’s director of diversity retention. Players on Liberty’s popular football and basketball teams have had fraught meetings with coaches and staff to discuss George Floyd, a black man whose death in police custody has roiled the nation, and the Falwell controversy.

Mr. Scott, who graduated from Liberty, said he now faces financial uncertainty because “people take one look at Liberty University on my résumé, and I always get asked the same question: Why would you go there?”

A regional broadcaster owned by an African-American businessman and Liberty alumnus threatened to no longer run Liberty advertising or content. And the larger Liberty alumni world showed a dissident streak unheard-of in the school’s nearly 50-year history.

“It has become obvious to many that your heart is in politics more than Christian academia or ministry, so we would encourage you to leave the position of school president and pursue politics full time,” said an open letter signed by 36 prominent African-American alumni, including several National Football League players. “Your statements hurt the ability of Liberty alumni to obtain jobs and have a voice in the culture. Having the school’s name on a résumé can be a liability to many of our graduates.”

The letter was turned into a petition on change.org, signed by nearly 37,000 people as of Monday.

The tumult has spread into town. Josh Read, owner of Lynchburg restaurant Fifth and Federal, tweeted his appreciation of Mr. Falwell’s face mask idea, saying, “We would offer them to our staff as a mask option!” An ensuing protest May 31 turned violent, when demonstrators threw rocks and debris at the restaurant and neighboring businesses, injuring police officers.

Mr. Read later apologized, saying: “We love all of our neighbors and people in this community. We’re just really saddened to see how badly they were hurt.”

Before Monday, Mr. Falwell had shown no remorse. He promoted the mock face mask again in an interview with the conservative television host Eric Bolling on May 27: “I hope everybody buys one.”

The uproar is more remarkable in light of Mr. Falwell’s tight control over Liberty and his intolerance for dissent. Liberty’s administration controls the content of the school newspaper. Faculty do not have tenure, and renew their contracts from year to year. And Liberty without a Falwell in charge would be a sea change for a school almost synonymous with the name.

The university was founded by Mr. Falwell’s famous father as a bastion of social conservatism, one that was unabashedly combative as it trained what it called “Champions for Christ.” Under the family, the university has grown from a modest Baptist college to a giant with cash investments and endowments of nearly $2 billion, nearly 46,000 undergraduates and a campus that sprawls across Lynchburg and neighboring communities in Virginia. Total enrollment, including online students, exceeds 100,000.

But this time, dissent ran deep. Even Mr. Falwell’s wife, Becki, chastised him. “I’m not wearing that mask, and I don’t approve of Jerry’s tweet,” she said on the Eric Bolling broadcast as Mr. Falwell laughed.

“We’ve extended a lot of grace and looked past a lot of things, but when we saw that tweet with the blackface and the KKK on it, we said enough is enough,” said Eric Carroll, pastor of the Ascension Church RVA in Richmond and a 1991 Liberty graduate.

Updated Dec. 18, 2020

The latest on how the pandemic is reshaping education.

After Mr. Falwell’s apology, Mr. Carroll said: “You can look at this one of a couple of ways. You can say, ‘Wow, he succumbed to the pressure, blah blah.’ I choose to believe he recognized the fact that he hurt some people. It took some time and some nudging, but his heart got right.”

He said there was no word on whether Mr. Falwell would meet with the organizers of the open letter. They reiterated that request by letter late Monday, adding that they would like to see Liberty’s administration “surround yourselves more with ethnically diverse pastors and advisers.”

The anger over the blackface tweet cannot be unraveled from Mr. Falwell’s contentious decision to reopen the campus after spring break, which Mr. Northam responded to by placing further restrictions on in-person instruction. Mr. Falwell reacted to coverage of his decision by lodging trespassing charges against journalists who visited the campus and threatening news media outlets, including The New York Times, with lawsuits.

Liberty students, parents and alumni have posted hundreds of messages on Facebook and Twitter objecting to Mr. Falwell’s recent behavior, some under the hashtag #LUDeservesBetter. Calum Best, a recent Liberty graduate, posted a manifesto on Facebook encouraging the Liberty community to lobby its board of trustees to censure him, and it was shared more than 700 times. Past controversies involving Mr. Falwell have not moved the board, which is composed of Falwell supporters and Mr. Falwell himself.

After talking with players and staff, Hugh Freeze, Liberty’s football coach, issued a statement on Twitter calling for unity. Ritchie McKay, Liberty’s men’s basketball coach, tweeted a statement that said in part: “The Liberty Flames men’s basketball players and staff are united in opposing PREJUDICE, BIGOTRY and RACISM. We’re against all intents associated with those three affronts to human dignity.” Mr. Falwell retweeted the statement.

Mr. McKay, who is black, said in an interview: “I wanted to talk to our guys, the people in our family and our staff, and I wanted to pray as I usually do. I felt like people would hopefully unite in a season like we’re in with Covid, the effect of it on our economy and what happened to George Floyd.”

Of Mr. Falwell, he said: “I feel really good about what he’s done on our campus. Leadership styles are different. This is a great place to work, and our guys are having I think a life-shaping experience.”

Black alumni who signed the open letter were less sanguine.

After the apology, Andre Whitehead, the chief executive of Whitehead Media Ventures, which runs a network of Virginia regional broadcasters, canceled a news conference in Lynchburg on Monday to announce that his company would no longer air Liberty advertisements and content.

In an interview before the apology, Mr. Whitehead, a 1988 Liberty graduate, said he had called Mr. Falwell personally last week asking him to apologize, delete the tweet and meet with the four organizers of the open letter.

“Just because you may have the right to say something does not mean that it’s the right thing to say,” Mr. Whitehead said he told Mr. Falwell. “Any references to a Klan outfit or blackface is offensive to people of color, no matter how you couch the reasons for saying these things.”

What did Mr. Falwell say?

“I’ll just say that he didn’t agree with my view,” Mr. Whitehead said. “I hope he changes his mind, and reconsiders.”

Democrats Unveil Sweeping Bill Targeting Police Misconduct and Racial Bias,"WASHINGTON — Democrats in Congress on Monday unveiled sweeping legislation aimed at combating excessive use of force and racial discrimination by the police and making it easier to identify, track and prosecute misconduct, the most expansive federal intervention into law enforcement that lawmakers have proposed in recent memory.

Introduced as a direct response to the recent killings of unarmed black Americans as protests of police violence and racial discrimination continue across the country, the bill proposes significant changes to the rules that govern how police officers operate and how they can be held accountable for wrongdoing. It comes as tens of thousands of Americans have taken to the streets to call for a nationwide reckoning with systemic racial discrimination, particularly by law enforcement.

The legislation would curtail protections that shield police officers accused of misconduct from being prosecuted and impose a new set of restrictions on law enforcement officers to prevent them from using deadly force except as a last resort. It includes many measures that civil rights activists have been pushing for decades, which have met with strong opposition from police unions and law enforcement groups.

Its prospects are uncertain on Capitol Hill, where Republicans — despite expressing outrage at some recent episodes of police violence toward black Americans and endorsing calls for change — have yet to indicate what steps, if any, they are willing to embrace. And elements of the measure have already drawn resistance from President Trump, who has called for a military crackdown on the protests and offered unqualified praise of law enforcement, including encouraging rough police tactics in the past.

“The Justice in Policing Act establishes a bold, transformative vision of policing in America,” said Representative Karen Bass of California, the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus. “Never again should the world be subjected to witnessing what we saw on the streets in Minneapolis, the slow murder of an individual by a uniformed police officer.”

“The world,” she continued, “is witnessing the birth of a new movement in our country.”

She was joined by Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, and Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California in introducing the measure. Immediately beforehand, they gathered with Democratic leaders to honor George Floyd, the black man whose death last month after a confrontation with Minneapolis police officers has fueled the protests. The lawmakers knelt for 8 minutes and 46 seconds — the exact amount of time that an officer knelt on Mr. Floyd’s neck as he lay pleading to be allowed to breathe.

Whether Democrats can seize the moment and push the changes into law remains unclear. The Democratic-led House, which plans to open hearings on the issue on Wednesday with a hearing featuring Mr. Floyd’s brother, is expected to pass the legislation swiftly. Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers who control the Senate have yet to weigh in on the proposals, but Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, shot down one of the provisions on Monday afternoon.

“He is looking at a number of proposals, but there are some nonstarters in there,” Ms. McEnany told reporters. She singled out a measure to alter the legal doctrine known as qualified immunity, which shields police officers from being held legally liable for damages sought by citizens whose constitutional rights are found to have been violated.

Past attempts at a broad federal overhaul of police practices have failed to bring about lasting change. In 2014, responding to an outpouring of outrage after a white police officer killed Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man in Ferguson, Mo., Democratic lawmakers called for swift legislative action to address the issue of racial bias in policing. But with Republicans in charge of both chambers arguing the matter was one for state and local governments to take up, little was achieved.

Democrats insisted on Monday that their efforts would not be halted again, arguing that the civic unrest that has erupted in small towns and big cities alike has created political momentum for changes.

“This moment of national anguish is being transformed into a movement of national action,” said Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California.

The legislation now proposed by House and Senate Democrats would amend the federal criminal code to make it easier to prosecute police officers for misconduct. Prosecutors now must prove that an officer “willfully” violated an individual’s constitutional rights; the bill would lower that standard, to actions undertaken with “reckless disregard” for the individual’s rights.

It would also create a national registry to track police misconduct and require law enforcement agencies to report data on the use of force.

The legislation closely aligns with reforms proposed by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, who called on Congress last week to ban police chokeholds and pledged that his administration would create a national police oversight commission and a new standard for use of force. Both measures are included in Democrats’ legislation unveiled on Monday, including one requiring law enforcement to use deadly force only as a last resort after employing a series of de-escalation tactics.

Among other reforms, the legislation would also require all uniformed federal officers to wear body cameras and mandate that state and local agencies use federal funds to “ensure” their use. It would also condition some federal grants on the adoption of anti-discrimination training and practices.

The legislation would not defund or otherwise dismantle police departments, a call that many protesters and some of the most progressive Democrats in Congress have taken up in recent days, arguing that police brutality can end only if departments are taken apart and revamped.

Representative Ilhan Omar, whose district includes Minneapolis, marched on Sunday at the front of a “Defund the Police” protest. Recirculating a video of a white police officer choking a black woman on Twitter, Ms. Omar asked, “How are we supposed to reform this?”

But that position has picked up scant support among other Democrats in Congress, even in the Progressive Caucus, whose members have coalesced around measures to increase law enforcement accountability.

That has not stopped Mr. Trump and some Republicans in Congress from falsely seeking to paint all Democrats as supporting the defunding movement and all proposals for change as extreme and dangerous.

The president spent much of Monday morning tweeting about “LAW & ORDER,” including in a post in which he said that “now the Radical Left Democrats want to Defund and Abandon our Police.”

Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader, took to Twitter to thank the police, adding, “Democrats want to defund you, but Republicans will never turn our backs on you.”

In a bid to quash that narrative, a spokesman for Mr. Biden on Monday put out a statement saying that he “does not believe that police should be defunded.”

“He hears and shares the deep grief and frustration of those calling out for change, and is driven to ensure that justice is done and that we put a stop to this terrible pain,” said the spokesman, Andrew Bates.

Ms. Pelosi also distanced herself from the defunding movement on Monday.

“We want to work with our police departments,” she said at the news conference. “There are many who take pride in their work, and we want to be able to make sure that the focus is on them.”

Still, she suggested that some restructuring of the role of law enforcement was in order.

“There are many issues that we call upon our police departments to deal with,” she said, including mental health and school safety. “We could rebalance some of our funding to address those issues more directly.”

Many of the proposals outlined by congressional Democrats are likely to face stiff opposition from police unions and national law enforcement groups who enjoy significant political power, both in local governments and in Congress. Some are also likely to face charges of federal overreach, because most police departments are under state and local control.

Still, the legislation amounts to the most comprehensive reimagining of policing by Congress in years. The proposal would limit the transfer of military weaponry to state and local departments and ban “no knock” warrants in federal drug cases that allow police officers to enter residences without warning.

Democratic leaders also hope the legislation can serve as a final push to designate lynching as a federal crime. Efforts to pass a stand-alone bill to do so have been blocked by Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, who has sought to narrow the bill’s definition of lynching, arguing that the measure’s language is overly broad and could lead to excessive sentencing.

‘Pandemic Within a Pandemic’: Coronavirus and Police Brutality Roil Black Communities,"WASHINGTON — When Mike Griffin, a black community organizer in Minneapolis, took to the streets in protest, he was grieving for two black men taken during the turmoil convulsing the country: George Floyd, who died after gasping for air under the knee of a white police officer, and his own godfather, who succumbed to Covid-19.

“I’m just as likely to die from a cop as I am from Covid,” he said.

In Providence, R.I., graduate students and alumni of color at the Brown University School of Public Health are demanding their professors take a strong stand against police violence — and direct research dollars to study it. And in Baltimore, a city still reckoning with the 2015 death of Freddie Gray in police custody, Rajikh Hayes, an activist, said protesters were acutely aware that they were risking exposure to the coronavirus, which is far likelier to kill black people than white people, and of the suffering Covid-19 had caused in their community.

“It’s really a simple question: ‘Am I going to let a disease kill me or am I going to let the system — the police?” he said. “And if something is going to take me out when I don’t have a job, which one do I prefer? Folks who don’t have much else to lose — they understand that this system isn’t built for black people. And that’s why people are in the streets.”

As protests over police brutality continue to roil cities, this is an extraordinary moment of pain for the nation, especially for black Americans who are bearing the brunt of three crises — police violence, crushing unemployment and the deadliest infectious disease threat in a century — that have laid bare longstanding injustice. Public health experts, activists and lawmakers say the triple threat requires a coordinated response.

“These are interrelated crises — the crisis of racism and inequality that is now converging with the crisis of Covid-19,” said Dr. Leana S. Wen, who was Baltimore’s health commissioner when Mr. Gray died, and who testified before Congress on Thursday about racial disparities in the pandemic. “There is no playbook for what you do for addressing public health impacts of civil unrest.”

The precise toll that the coronavirus has taken on people of color remains unknown; not every state collects data. The Trump administration, under pressure from Congress, announced on Thursday new requirements for states to do so. But an analysis of data from 40 states and the District of Columbia, released last month by the nonpartisan APM Research Lab, found black Americans are more than twice as likely as whites, Latinos or Asian-Americans to die from the coronavirus. In some states, the disparity is much greater.

Devastating job losses are also “hitting black workers and their families especially hard,” according to a recent report by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank. The unemployment rate for black Americans is 16.8 percent, compared with 12.4 percent for white Americans, according to federal data released Friday. And while the economy is showing hints of recovery, African-Americans are being left out; the black unemployment rate rose slightly in May despite a decline of nearly two points for white workers.

On Capitol Hill, lawmakers are trying to respond. Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, introduced legislation last week calling for the creation of a “truth, racial healing and transformation commission” to examine the legacy of slavery and systemic racism. Black Americans, she said, are suffering “a pandemic within a pandemic.”

Mr. Floyd is a case in point. He died with coronavirus antibodies in his blood, surviving infection only to die in police custody. With so many people protesting Mr. Floyd’s death, many of them black and brown, state and local health officials are bracing for a fresh wave of coronavirus infections.

The mass incarceration of black people has only worsened the pandemic’s heavy toll on minorities. Black Americans are incarcerated in state prisons at five times the rate of whites, according to the Sentencing Project, a Washington advocacy group. Prisons are breeding grounds for the coronavirus, and jails pose a particular threat, because people cycle in and out, spreading disease in their neighborhoods.

“The actual incarceration, housing of people, is only part of it,” said Nickolas Zaller, a public health professor at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences who studies the relationship between health and the criminal justice system. “When people are released, what job opportunities do they have? What is their housing situation? All of these other factors relate back to the current pandemic.”

Trevor Noah, the South African-born host of “The Daily Show,” connected the dots from Amy Cooper, a white woman who falsely accused an African-American bird watcher of threatening her, to the death of Mr. Floyd. All are playing out “against the backdrop,” he said, of a public health crisis that has left Americans of all races frustrated, uncertain and stuck inside.

“While everyone is facing the battle against coronavirus, black people in America are still facing the battle against racism and coronavirus,” he said in a recent 18-minute monologue, adding, “Coronavirus exposed all of it.”

For many involved in the protests, the pandemic is deeply personal. Some have lost friends or family members to the coronavirus. Others have lost jobs, or are front-line workers — in grocery stores, hospitals, mass transit systems — putting themselves at risk of infection.

“We’ve had a lot of volunteers come out and just tell us how they’re unable to work right now, and they just can’t sit home and do nothing,” said Jacqueline LaBayne, 23, of Freedom Fighters D.C., which led hundreds in a march to the Capitol in recent days. “Even local businesses, they can’t take customers, and they are donating meals. It’s honestly incredible, the support we’ve gotten in these circumstances, because so many people are affected by Covid.”

In New York, Rashid Shabazz, the chief marketing officer of the online organization Color of Change, displayed symptoms of the coronavirus for several weeks, he said, but was unable to get tested. He said the respiratory illness reminded him of the dying words — “I can’t breathe” — of Mr. Floyd and another victim of police violence, Eric Garner, who was put in an illegal chokehold.

Mr. Shabazz wrote about it in a column for The Root, a black news and opinion site, under the headline “We Can’t Breathe: Covid-19 and Police Injustice are Suffocating Black People.”

At the Brown University School of Public Health, about 20 students and recent graduates in the department of behavioral and social sciences wrote the predominantly white faculty a letter demanding a “response to police brutality and anti-blackness,” citing the coronavirus and the recent killings of three African-Americans: Breonna Taylor, killed by the police in Louisville, Ky., Ahmaud Arbery, shot in South Georgia after being pursued by armed white residents, and Mr. Floyd.

The letter has prompted painful conversations, both students and professors say. Don Operario, a professor, said he convened a meeting of those who wanted to “transform this inner reflection to actual words and action.” School administrators followed up with a statement pledging to “tackle these inequities.”

The students want more than talk. Arjee Restar, who just received her Ph.D., said the group wanted to break “silence and a lack of investment in anti-black police brutality work.” Ashley Gomez, a doctoral student, said professors who were quick to “adapt their research” to study the coronavirus needed to apply for grants to study racism as well.

At Thursday’s virtual hearing before Congress, witnesses told lawmakers that some of the same forces — distrust of institutions — at work in the pandemic were also fueling the protests against police violence. Dr. Uché Blackstock, a doctor in New York whose company, Advancing Health Equity, works to address racial disparities in health, said many of her black patients who had the coronavirus did not get tested out of either a reluctance to see a doctor or a lack of available testing.

One patient, seeing the protective gear that covered Dr. Blackstock’s skin, asked if she was black, she said, because he wanted to make sure his concerns would be taken seriously. She said she worried that Covid-19 would become a disease of marginalized communities, just as AIDS was in the late 1990s, when white Americans had access to new medicines and health care while many black Americans, with fewer economic resources, did not.

“I’m worried about black communities and other communities of color being stigmatized, as those are the people with coronavirus,” she said, adding, “We need to equitably allocate resources to black communities as quickly as possible.”

Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3 House Democrat, who oversees the select committee examining the federal response to the pandemic and led the hearing, said he intended to make sure that the trillions of dollars Congress appropriated for coronavirus relief was spent “efficiently effectively equitably, and I’m particularly interested in the equitable part of it.” But he also said he intended to “nudge my caucus” to pass legislation banning the police tactics used to detain Mr. Floyd.

After the Baltimore unrest in 2015, Dr. Wen, now a public health professor at George Washington University, declared racism a public health issue, which she said “raised a lot of eyebrows at the time.”

More people are thinking that way now. In North Carolina, where African-Americans account for 28 percent of coronavirus cases but only 22 percent of the population, the state health secretary decried “structural racism” last week. In Ohio, where black people account for 18 percent of Covid-19 deaths but 13 percent of the population, officials in Franklin County have declared racism a public health crisis.

Ms. Lee, the congresswoman, said she intended to ask her county to make such a declaration. Despite the turmoil — “It’s an emotional roller coaster right now,” she said — she feels optimistic.

“This is a transformative moment,” she said. “I’m sad, I’m angry, but I have hope.”"
"Minneapolis Will Dismantle Its Police Force, Council Members Pledge","MINNEAPOLIS — Nine members of the Minneapolis City Council — a veto-proof majority — pledged on Sunday to dismantle the Police Department, promising to create a new system of public safety in a city where law enforcement has long been accused of racism.

Saying that the city’s policing system could not be reformed, the council members stood before hundreds of people gathered late in the day on a grassy hill and promised to begin the process of taking apart the Police Department as it now exists.

For activists who have been pushing for years for drastic changes to policing, the move represented a turning point that they hope will lead to a transformation of public safety in the city.

“It shouldn’t have taken so much death to get us here,” Kandace Montgomery, the director of Black Visions Collective, said from the stage at the rally. “We’re safer without armed, unaccountable patrols supported by the state hunting black people.”

The pledge in Minneapolis, where George Floyd died 13 days ago after being pinned to the ground by a white police officer’s knee, reflected calls across America to rethink what policing looks like. Protesters have taken to the streets with demands to shrink or abolish police departments, and “defund the police” has become a frequent rallying cry.

Officials in other cities, including New York, have begun to talk of diverting some money and responsibilities from police forces to social services agencies, but no other major city has gone as far in reaction to the protests as the Minneapolis officials have promised to do.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”



Today, several major U.S. cities are now proposing ways to defund and even dismantle their police departments. John Eligon on the thinking behind those plans and what they might look like in practice.

It’s Tuesday, June 9.

(CHANTING) I can’t breathe! I can’t breathe!

In the early days of the protests after George Floyd was killed —

(CHANTING) No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace!

— it was just pure emotions and raw rage.

[EXPLETIVE] these racist [EXPLETIVE] police!

But pretty soon, once the more fiery protests and fiery unrest died down, then we started seeing the organizers come in and talking about what they want. And one thing we quickly saw were these face masks that people were wearing. They were black, and they had yellow writing on them. And they said, “Defund police.”

Hmm.

And from there, you start hearing these calls at protest, at rallies.

(CHANTING) Defund the police! Defund the police!

You start hearing, “Defund the police.”

You start hearing calls to abolish the police. You start seeing people waving signs. And it became clear that this was an opening that a lot of activists saw to take this moment of a very brutal police killing and turn it into something much larger.

Do the right thing!

Defund the police!

So John, what do these concepts — defund, dismantle, abolish the police — what exactly do they mean?

To defund, when activists say that, what they mean is taking money away from the police department’s budget and redirect it toward other things — whether that be social services, agencies, maybe mental health agencies — that can do functions that police are often called on to do.

Mm-hmm.

But if you fully defund it, you can get to a space where the police department is abolished. And so essentially, what that means is that there is no more police department as we know it. You don’t call these men and women in blue shirts to come racing to your door with their guns in hand. It means that they have to figure out some other form of providing that public safety, and the police department would not be that form.

And where did these concepts come from?

Well, at their core, they come from the problems and issues that especially communities of color, especially black communities, have had with policing. They see police coming into their communities to brutalize them, not to protect and serve them. And that has really influenced this desire to keep the police away, to do something else. And we’ve seen, basically, that governments and police forces, they respond with certain reforms. We’ve seen efforts for body cameras. We’ve seen diversifying the police departments. We’ve seen changes to the rules on use of force.

Mm-hmm.

But what became clear to a lot of today’s activists, and what they say explicitly, is that these reforms are not working. If you look at since Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Missouri six years ago, the police have continued to kill people at high rates, and especially black people at disproportionately high rates. And so for them, the only solution is to tear it down and build something new.

So John, what might it actually look like in practice to defund or abolish a police department?

So for instance, if someone is homeless and they’re struggling on the streets, a person can call 9-1-1, and instead of an armed police officer being sent out, perhaps there can be an outreach worker from a homeless services agency. Or if you have someone having a mental health episode, then again, you can call 9-1-1, and instead of a police officer, maybe a health care worker, a mental health worker will come out. And the idea behind it is to really cut down the interactions between armed police officers and civilians. And by doing that, the hope is that it will reduce their conflict and the potential for people getting hurt or killed by police officers.

Right. I mean, that makes a certain sense, especially for a community where there’s not a lot of violent crime. But every community is different, right? And some towns, some cities — I think about New York City, for example — have a significantly higher rate of violent crime that would seem to require having armed police. So how do activists think about that?

For a lot of the activists that I spoke to, the issue was about centering public safety on communities. And one activist that I spoke to, Arianna Nason, she said essentially it’s going to be up to each community to decide what public safety looks like for itself.

It’s going to be up to every community to decide what they need. We can’t decide that.

So maybe that’s armed patrols. Maybe that’s mental health workers. Maybe that’s some sort of mobile units with social workers sitting in it, and people are trained in using force and different things. One of the big ideas is this idea of community policing, community watch. And it’s interesting. I had said isn’t an issue, though, with community policing or community patrols, neighborhood watch, that if I walk into that community, as a black man with dreadlocks, if I walk into one of these communities, we see what happens with neighborhood watch. We see Trayvon Martin. We see Ahmaud Arbery.

Should that be a concern, then? I guess with this community-type based model that certain people who look a certain way might go into the neighborhood, and that community might decide to take it into their own hands and then take it overboard, I guess.

And she took off her sunglasses. She looked at me, and she said —

No, I get that. And I’ll be really real with you. For me, personally, I don’t have all the answers for that. I don’t. And I wish I did. A lot of it is —

Honestly, I don’t really know the answer to that right now.

Huh.

She was not sure exactly what the answer was. And see, this is all to say, it’s still very tricky and very much a work in progress. But what she did say is that the current system also is not working for me either. So it’s a matter of what are they going to do differently? And they believe that something drastically different needs to be done.

Mm-hmm. As best you can tell, would any of the familiar elements of an existing police department — I’m thinking, for the sake of argument, homicide detectives, special victims units that investigate sexual assault or rape — do those remain? Do they take a different form? Do they adopt a different name? Has that been fleshed out?

I would say, no, it’s not been fleshed out. Because again, we go back to the fact that this is not going to be some federal commission, or even state commission or a city commission for anywhere that’s going to come up with, like, these are the rules for public safety now. And these are all things that need to be worked out. And I think what people say with things like homicide investigations, with sex crimes investigations and things like that, they say a couple of things. One, the police are not doing a good job at those anyways. So you have lots of cities where the clearance rate on homicides and other investigations is miserable. You had, even here in Minneapolis, there was a big scandal with all the rape kits that they had untested. So they had a lot of issues with crimes that were not being investigated properly. And then, the second thing that people say is that those jobs can be taken up by specialized, trained people. You can build new institutions to do those things that aren’t necessary policing. I did talk to one council member who said, maybe there’s still police, but for very, very limited role, and many of their responsibilities are farmed out. You know, anything short of some sort of active violence, you don’t need police for. So in some people’s eyes, that would still be a police force. But one thing that the people who are most ardent about abolishing the police or defunding the police, even, they make it clear that they don’t just want a system in which it’s police in another name, police with another uniform on.



And these demands to defund the police, they’ve actually been brewing in Minneapolis for several years now. Ever since a police killing back in 2015, there’s been several local activist groups working on it. And those activist groups came together this past weekend in what was probably the biggest and most clearest demand for defunding the police.

We’ll be right back.

(CHANTING) Abolish the M.P.D.!

So there were hundreds of activists who went and gathered in front of the mayor Jacob Frey’s house.

Abolish the M.P.D.! And they had a megaphone. They were chanting. They were screaming. And sure enough, the mayor came out to talk to the protesters. He kind of made his way through the crowd, walked up to the front, and you had one of the lead organizers for a group called the Black Visions Collective. Kandace Montgomery, she was standing up on a riser there, talking down in a megaphone to the mayor.

Jacob Frey, we have a yes-or-no question for you. Yes or no, will you commit to defunding Minneapolis Police Department?

[INAUDIBLE]

And you could tell, like, there is this hesitation because he knows this is not going to go well, right? You have all these very vocal, very ardent activists around you who want you to defund the police.

Will you defund the Minneapolis Police Department?

[CROWD MURMURING]

All right, be quiet y’all. Be quiet, because it’s important that we actually hear this. It’s important that we hear this, because if y’all don’t know, he’s up for re-election next year.

[CROWD CHEERING]

And then —

I do not support the full abolition of the police department.

All right!

You’re wasting our time! Get the [EXPLETIVE] out of here!

And he gives his answer — he does not support full abolition of the police.

(CHANTING) Go home, Jacob, go home! Go home, Jacob, go home!

And he turns around, and he just kind of walked off into the sea of people.

(CHANTING) Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame!

So after this event, there was already an event planned for the following day by some of these same activists organizations, in which they were going to bring council members who were supportive of their cause onto a stage in a park in the Southern part of the city. And they were going to try to get them to make a commitment to defunding the police.

So a lot like what they had done to the mayor?

Exactly.

Hi, Minneapolis. You look so beautiful today. I’m Lisa Bender. I’m the president of the Minneapolis City Council.

And so we had this gathering where there were hundreds of residents.

Our efforts at incremental reform have failed. Period.

And you had council members.

Our commitment is to do what’s necessary to keep every single member of our community safe, and to tell the truth that the Minneapolis Police are not doing that. [CROWD CHEERS]

And you had nine of them who went up on the stage.

We are here today to begin the process of ending the Minneapolis Police Department. [CROWD CHEERS]

And then all nine of them each read a part pledging to defend the police.

All of us on this stage support this statement, and we stand with the people of Minneapolis in fighting for a safer community. [CROWD CHEERS]

The last council member, he basically said, and we are all committing to this pledge. And at that moment, it was like this emotional eruption.

[INAUDIBLE], get up, y’all. We are transforming our city right now. Get up! get

You had white people, black people, Asian people, all putting their fists in the air, shouting, defund the police, defund police.

(CHANTING) Defund M.P.D.! Defund M.P.D.! Defund M.P.D.!

So just to be clear, this is not a vote, and not necessarily even a pledge to vote, but this is a public commitment to defund the police — to do the very thing that the mayor, when asked, declined to agree to 24 hours before.

Yes, exactly. This is a pledge that they are going to defund the police. It is not a vote. It is not anything set in stone or written. But these are putting them all on record in front of many community members, saying that we are going to do this. And I even asked the activists about that. I said, we’ve heard politicians say things before and not keep those pledges. But this is something that they saw they’ve been working on with them together in tandem. So I think there’s a level of trust there that this pledge has really meant something. And you could see it in the reaction of the people who were there. They were really describing it as their Civil Rights Movement, their Voting Rights Act moment.

Wow. And John, can the members of the City Council who were in that park, making this pledge, do they have the actual authority to take away funding from the police department?

Yes, they absolutely have voting authority to do that. The council actually controls the police department’s budget. And what’s more significant about this moment is that because there were nine of them, those nine seats represents a veto-proof majority. So even if the mayor, Jacob Frey, does not want this to happen, if that coalition sticks together, they can do this on their own. And I think what we’re seeing is this sentiment is growing in traction in certain places. Like we already have in New York and Los Angeles, the mayors in both of those cities have already said that they are going to be redirecting funds that were intended for the police toward other parts of the city, toward other agencies in the city.

I’m curious what the appetite for this kind of change to policing is, beyond the cities where there are largely Democratic city councils and mayors, and where this is now under discussion.

That’s a very key question, right? We’re already seeing conservatives coming out against this and talking about this is as very radical leftist step to be taking. We see Donald Trump already tweeting about it. So certainly, this is something that, for conservative communities, something like this would be a tougher sell. And so again, policing is a very local thing. So what you experience and what the police force does or does not look like in Minneapolis is going to be very different than what it does or does not look like in Edina, which is just outside of Minneapolis, or any other suburb. So it’s going to be, in some ways, a patchwork of public safety, I think, if these things start happening around the country.

And I guess an open question is whether or not this has entered the mainstream, even of the Democratic Party. Just a few hours before you and I began to talk, Joe Biden came out and said he does not support defunding the police.

Yeah, this is certainly not something that is part of the mainstream or moderate Democratic platform. That said, you do get some people who might be in these more moderate spaces, you do get their attention and you do get their ear, is this sense that policing is not working — which is just the basis of what these defund or abolish the police efforts are about, is that the system is not working. And so you will get even the more moderate folks to say that, to buy into that. And that may not result in them supporting a defund or abolishment, but will it support more stringent reforms, more significant reforms to police? So we’ll see what happens.

I wonder how the activists that you’re talking to see the challenge of explaining what these concepts are going to mean. Because in this moment, I think many Americans are really hearing these calls — defund, dismantle, abolish — for the first time. And they may be very wary of them, and they may see them as quite radical.

What the activists will tell you is that while it might sound radical for many Americans, this actually is not all that radical for a large section of this country.

What was your name, sir?

Yaazirah

How do you spell that?

Y-A-H- —

If you go to black and brown communities — like I went up to the North Side of Minneapolis — and you talk to people about their experiences with the police there, it is not the experience of expecting an officer to come and help you. It’s exactly the opposite. And I was speaking with a couple there, Amanda and Yaazirah Brazelton.

It’s about time for a change.

A change, yeah.

Yeah. About time for a change.

And they were telling me that from a young age, essentially, they already had horrific experiences with the police.

[INAUDIBLE] I have police put guns in my face, you know, at seven years old, coming to my house with my mother and my father arguing, just regular argument that happens with a husband and wife.

Yaazirah, he was seven years old when the police came to his house when his parents were having an argument.

And they put guns in my face and put us all on the ground.

And then they stuck a gun in his face.

They traumatized me in childhood, so I was really against white police officers since.

And his wife Amanda, she was 14 when she was in a car with white people, and she’s black.

We were driving in the car. All my white friends got out. And as soon as I got out, they pulled guns, yelled at —

And when they were pulled over, the cops let the white people out, but then they pulled guns on her.

I’m 14 years old, in the backseat of the car, not doing nothing wrong. And that was my first real incident with the police in that interaction.

And so the way they see the police department is not a force where you call and then an Officer Friendly shows up.

Man, I got a houseful of kids that are scared of the police because of what they’ve seen.

It’s one where Amanda recalled her children have already had run-ins with the police that when someone was breaking into their house once, she didn’t call the police, but she called family and friends.

And I called him. I called my brother. I called my uncle. I called my dad, my mom, before called the police.

Why didn’t you call the police?

Because they kill black people. They’ll call me, I’ll get killed in my own home.

So it’s already a lived experience, a lived reality for people in many black communities, that the police are essentially a force that only exists, in their eyes, to harass them, to brutalize them and not to protect them. And what the activists hope is that people who are scared that abolishing police will suddenly lead to a breakdown in their communities and just rampant violence, they’re saying, no, this will create outcomes that will make the community safer and better, not just for affluent white communities, but for all communities across the country. And so what activists are asking is that people who see this as a radical idea, who can’t envision a world without police, they’re asking them to just walk in these people’s shoes, understand what they’re going through.



John, thank you very much.

Thank you.

The nine members of the city council that came from every corner of our city to stand together to make this commitment, we don’t have all the answers.

In an interview on Monday, the president of the Minneapolis City Council, one of the nine members who has pledged to defund the city’s police department, acknowledged that implementing the plan would likely take years.

And if you look back at the last 150 years of our police department, it is becoming increasingly clear that that model of policing isn’t working. I hope it won’t take 150 years to get to that looking forward, that next solution. But we have a lot of wisdom in our community. We have invested in [INAUDIBLE] —



We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today.

Good morning, everyone. The Justice in Policing Act establishes a bold, transformative vision of policing in America.

On Monday, Congressional Democrats introduced the most sweeping federal plan to reform the police in modern memory.

Never again should the world be subjected to witnessing what we saw on the streets in Minneapolis — the slow murder of an individual by a uniformed police officer.

The legislation would reduce the legal protections that now shield police officers accused of misconduct from being prosecuted, and would impose new restrictions to prevent police officers from using deadly force. The measure is expected to quickly pass in the House, where there’s a Democratic majority, but faces an uncertain future in the Republican-controlled Senate. Meanwhile, state-level reforms continue. On Monday, New York’s legislature banned the use of chokeholds by police and repealed a statute that effectively hid the disciplinary records of police officers.

And —

Almost 7 million cases of Covid-19 have now been reported to W.H.O., and almost 400,000 deaths. Although the situation in Europe is improving, globally, it’s worsening.

The World Health Organization said that the number of new daily infections from the coronavirus hit a record high — more than 136,000 on Sunday — and warned that mass protests in places like the U.S. could further spread the virus.

We encourage all those protesting around the world to do so safely. Clean your hands, cover your cough and wear a mask if you attend a protest.

Finally, the National Bureau of Economic Research said that because of the pandemic, the United States economy officially entered a recession in February, ending the longest economic expansion on record. It began in 2009 and lasted 128 months.



That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. My colleague Caitlin Dickerson will host the show tomorrow.

Council members said in interviews on Sunday that they did not yet have specific plans to announce for what a new public safety system for the city would look like. They promised to develop plans by working with the community, and said they would draw on past studies, consent decrees and reforms to policing across the nation and the world.

Protesters who gathered at the windswept rally, with a view of Powderhorn Lake, said what mattered most was that elected officials had finally committed to a sweeping overhaul of policing, even though they had not offered specifics of how a dismantling would work.

“There needs to be change,” said Paola Lehman, a 23-year-old actor and educator in Minneapolis.

As the council members each read a line of the pledge to the crowd, Wintana Melekin, 32, clasped her hands above her head wrap, her mouth open in stunned silence beneath a sagging mask with the inscription “Defund Police.”

“I knew it was happening, but I didn’t believe it,” she said.

When the final portion was read, a roar went up among the hundreds in the crowd. Many people raised their fists in the air and chanted, “Defund M.P.D.!”

Though the City Council controls the police budget, the department answers to Mayor Jacob Frey, who has a veto over the Council’s actions. Council members said they had enough votes to override a veto by Mr. Frey, who was booed out of a rally by hundreds of people on Saturday after he said he did not believe in abolishing the Police Department. Mr. Frey quietly exited through an angry crowd as many shouted “Go home, Jacob Frey!” and “Shame! Shame!” 

Councilwoman Alondra Cano, who leads the Council’s public safety committee, said that scene made her think about the need to create space for discussions — a truth and reconciliation commission of sorts — to develop solutions to the city’s policing issues.

“Protesting is good and needed, press conferences are good and needed,” she said. “That third space is needed where we are committed to each other, and not the camera.”

Mr. Frey said on Sunday that while he opposed dismantling the Police Department, he would “work relentlessly” with the city’s police chief and the community “toward deep, structural reform and addressing systemic racism in police culture.” He added that he was “ready to dig in and enact more community-led public safety strategies.”

The City Council voted on Friday to accept a civil rights investigation of the police by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights and to amend the Police Department’s use-of-force policy to ban chokeholds, among other measures.

Protesters’ cries to defund or abolish the police are often not meant literally. Rather, they are demands to rethink a law enforcement system from the ground up and to grapple with deeply ingrained issues, including employing officers who do not live in the city they police — as is done in Minneapolis — and sending armed officers to respond to situations that turn out not to be crimes, as when a mentally ill person is in distress.

Some proposals have focused on ending heavy-handed police tactics like no-knock search warrants and military-style raids on the homes of suspects, restricting the flow of military gear to police departments and banning the use of military equipment on protesters.

A common thread has been the tendency of police departments to consume ever larger shares of city budgets.

“We’re really saying we want to grow our community, and we want to invest in the things we actually need,” said Ms. Montgomery, who led the protest on Saturday and grilled Mr. Frey on his views, leading to the chants that prompted him to leave the scene. 

Council members and activists pointed to examples of different styles of policing in places like Austin, Texas, where the operators who answer 911 calls inquire whether a caller needs police, fire or mental health services before dispatching a response, and in Eugene, Ore., where a medic and a crisis worker with mental health training are dispatched to emergency calls.

Many have called for relying more on self-policing by the community, in the way attendees often do at events like music festivals, with the police stepping in only when a true emergency arises. Some cited as an example how, in the days after the killing of Mr. Floyd, teams made up of dozens of members of the American Indian Movement patrolled streets and directed traffic in the Little Earth housing community in Minneapolis.

Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of Black Lives Matter and chair of Reform L.A. Jails, said the move by the Minneapolis City Council members had shifted the movement to rethink policing from the fringe to the mainstream.

“This is massive,” Ms. Cullors said. “This is the first time we are seeing, in our country’s history, a conversation about defunding, and some people having a conversation about abolishing the police and prison state. This must be what it felt like when people were talking about abolishing slavery.”

Many advocates note that city budgets are already strained by the coronavirus pandemic, which shut down business and tourism, sharply reducing tax revenue, and that police budgets may be especially vulnerable.

The city of Minneapolis is looking to cut $200 million from its $1.3 billion overall budget, according to Lisa Bender, the president of the City Council. She said she hoped to reallocate some money from policing, which received $189 million in the 2020 budget, to other areas of need in the city.

Councilman Jeremiah Ellison, who represents North Minneapolis, said he would not frame what the Council was doing as defunding the police, but rather as “funding a different safety strategy.”

He said: “Is the goal to execute some kind of vendetta against M.P.D? No.” 

Lt. Bob Kroll, the president of the Minneapolis Police Union, did not respond to requests for comment.

Andy Skoogman, executive director of the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association, said he supported reforming rather than defunding the police. While he welcomed additional investment in social services for mental health, domestic violence and homelessness, he said, the traditional police force “is an essential service and must still be funded.”

“When someone is in immediate danger, fearing for his or her life, would these victims still have a place to call and a person who is willing and able to help?” he asked. “If so, then we’re open to more discussions.”

Activists have been calling for change in the Minneapolis Police Department for a long time. Outrage over police killings prompted many of the current City Council members to run for office.

“We warned them years ago that this will become the next Ferguson,” Nekima Levy-Armstrong, president of the Racial Justice Network, said of city officials. “They didn’t listen.”

Ms. Levy-Armstrong said she was worried about completely abolishing the Police Department, fearing that city leaders would make decisions without sufficient input from minority communities.

“If they want to disband the police,” she said, “they need to come up with ways and methods to keep our people safe.” 

After the accusations of police brutality through the years, the failed past attempts at reform and then the horrific footage of Mr. Floyd’s killing — as well as the police response to protests that has included rubber bullets and tear gas — major changes to policing in Minneapolis are now inevitable, said Kenza Hadj-Moussa, a spokeswoman for TakeAction Minnesota, an advocacy group.

“No one feels safe calling the police, period,” she said. “They’re not doing their basic function of public safety.”

Birthday for Breonna: A Campaign to Mourn and Honor,"— Cate Young, a Los Angeles based film and culture critic who founded #BirthdayForBreonna

In Her Words is available as a newsletter. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox.

On Friday, Breonna Taylor would have turned 27.

Taylor, an emergency medical technician, was killed by the police on March 13 during a late night drug investigation in Louisville, Ky. Three officers barged into her apartment, using a so-called no-knock search warrant, which allows the police to enter without warning. Her boyfriend, who said he thought someone was breaking into the apartment, shot an officer in the leg. The police ended up shooting Taylor eight times.

To mark her birthday, thousands of demonstrators gathered in downtown Louisville at around 7 p.m. Many had been protesting all day in different parts of the city, but in the evening they gathered specifically for Taylor’s birthday. Her face, as painted by the artist Jaylin Stewart, was projected onto City Hall. The protesters sang “Happy Birthday.” They chanted “Say Her Name!” And they marched around the city for hours. There was anger and pain, but there was also hope and tender love.

Online, a campaign aimed to flood Instagram and Twitter with Taylor’s name using the hashtag #BirthdayForBreonna. The campaign’s other action items included signing an online petition calling for justice, donating to an online fund for Taylor’s family and sending birthday cards to Kentucky’s attorney general, Daniel Cameron, urging him to charge the three officers.

Some celebrities, like Kerry Washington, Busy Philipps and Charlize Theron, joined in by sharing the hashtag and the campaign’s list of action items. By Saturday afternoon, the online fund for Taylor’s family had raised more than $5 million — far exceeding its initial goal of $500,000.

“It has just been growing and growing,” said Cate Young, a Los Angeles-based film and culture critic, who created the campaign. “People really stepped up.”

“I discovered on Instagram that some bakers had even started making cakes for her, and one greeting card company designed cards for her,” she added.

In the weeks immediately after Taylor died, her case didn’t receive much news media and political attention, falling in line with a longstanding pattern in which police brutality against black women is rendered invisible.

“I had just been following the story about police brutality and about George Floyd, and her name stopped coming up,” Young said. “I was really frustrated to see her be erased in real time.”

Because she is immunocompromised, Young wasn’t able to participate in the protests against police brutality that are taking over cities across the United States amid the coronavirus pandemic. So she decided to galvanize people online.

“I just wanted to do something,” Young said. “I was like, I’m going to drive myself insane with worry and panic if I don’t do something.”

We should be showing up for black women “in the same way that we show up for black men,” she added.

Biden Walks a Cautious Line as He Opposes Defunding the Police,"Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. staked out a careful position on Monday in support of a law enforcement overhaul but not defunding police departments, rebutting a new Republican attack line as he tries to harness growing activism against systemic racism while not alienating protesters or more moderate voters.

In the face of continuing protest marches calling to “defund the police” nationwide in the aftermath of George Floyd’s killing, Mr. Biden’s campaign said in a statement that he “hears and shares the deep grief and frustration of those calling out for change” and that he “supports the urgent need for reform.” But a campaign spokesman, Andrew Bates, said flatly that Mr. Biden was opposed to cutting police funding and believed more spending was necessary to help improve law enforcement and community policing.

Mr. Biden’s effort to address the calls of protesters while supporting law enforcement comes after gruesome videos and energetic protests have quickly reshaped public opinion about racial discrimination, seemingly opening a substantial window for new policies that could bring far-reaching change to law-enforcement agencies long accused of racially discriminatory practices. But there are already signs of division between activists who are eager to dismantle police departments and congressional Democrats who favor a less drastic overhaul of law enforcement.

President Trump’s campaign and leading Republicans have sought to drive a wedge between the immediate-but-incremental calls for change among elected Democrats and the more sweeping demands that protesters are calling for in places like Minneapolis, where the death of Mr. Floyd after police officers pinned him down has prompted worldwide calls for racial justice. 

Mr. Trump, for his part, has not endorsed any new changes to policing procedures or funding. On Monday, he met with law enforcement officials at the White House and praised them, saying virtually all police officers were “great, great people” and boasting on Twitter that crime was low nationwide.

The debate within the Democratic Party was on plain display on Monday, as congressional leaders unveiled a broad legislative program on policing, including new limits on the use of lethal force and on the legal protections afforded to officers accused of misconduct. Only hours before, progressives at the municipal level in Minneapolis pledged on Sunday to take apart the city’s long-troubled Police Department and rebuild it altogether.

Asked by the CBS host Norah O’Donnell on Monday if he supported defunding the police, Mr. Biden answered: “No, I don’t support defunding the police. I support conditioning federal aid to police based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness.”

Mr. Biden’s position — a stance on policing that another prominent Democrat, Bill Clinton, might have summed up as “mend it, don’t end it” — aligned him far more closely with lawmakers in Washington than with activists and left-wing lawmakers at the municipal level. His approach drew wide support from Democratic Party officials and a number of civil rights leaders, as well as politicians in the swing states likeliest to decide the general election.

That’s in part because few Democrats have embraced activist demands to make deep cuts to police budgets or to shutter local law-enforcement agencies altogether. Answering those calls, most party leaders have tried to mingle sympathy for the underlying grievances of police critics with Biden-style rejection of ideas like police abolition.

“We need police officers, and we need law enforcement,” said Bob Buckhorn, the former mayor of Tampa, Fla., and a supporter of Mr. Biden’s. “They are oftentimes the only thing between good and evil, and between chaos and calm.”

Mr. Buckhorn said policymakers needed to address legitimate “built-up anger,” but he also cautioned, “Anybody who is suggesting that they defund the police, whatever that means, I think would be making a terrible mistake.”

Even a number of progressive Democrats do not think Mr. Biden should suddenly veer left.

Several young black leaders said Mr. Biden should pursue a criminal justice overhaul, and seek out and elevate activists who are organizing peaceful demonstrations.

“That puts him in front of people he’s not usually in front of and demonstrates what kind of leader he is,” Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II of Michigan said.

Quentin James, who runs an organization dedicated to electing African-American officials, said, “I don’t think we need him to say ‘defund police,’ but he can help lift up groups like Collective PAC that are trying to elect reform-minded prosecutors.”

Mr. Trump’s attempts to mount a soft-on-crime campaign against Mr. Biden may prove difficult. The 2020 presidential election, after all, is not Mr. Biden’s first attempt to balance the public’s appetite for change with deeply rooted conservatism in much of the country.

He channeled the rage of young voters who were furious about Vietnam and Watergate to claim a Senate seat in Delaware in the same year that Richard M. Nixon won a 49-state re-election landslide thanks to the perceived excesses of the Democratic left and its presidential nominee, George McGovern.

Ever since, Mr. Biden, 77, has carefully balanced the passions of activists with the sensibilities of the political center, portraying himself as both a champion for racial equality and a reliable ally of law enforcement.

His statement on Monday and a speech he gave last week in Philadelphia reflected the impulses of someone who, for much of his career, represented a state that was politically competitive and split between a heavily urban northern tier and its so-called “slower lower” rural south.

Mr. Biden’s positioning also owes to his grounding in a Senate where forging consensus was a necessity even if it meant, as he memorably noted last year, working with segregationists.

Such comments infuriated many Democrats during the party’s presidential primary race, especially younger progressives who, at their most charitable, viewed him as a well-meaning if out-of-touch relic from yesteryear.

Yet then as now Mr. Biden has been greatly aided by Mr. Trump, whose divisive message and conduct have only alienated up-for-grabs voters who are craving stability. At this stage in the campaign, voters are comparing Mr. Biden — to borrow a Bidenism — not to the Almighty but to the alternative, and so far Mr. Trump has offered little to Americans seeking a sympathetic and textured response to the crisis.

Mr. Biden is also finding it easier to stake out ground in support of overhauling the police because the polling has shifted considerably on the issue, making it harder for Mr. Trump to gain much leverage from his repeated calls for “law and order.”

A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll indicated that just 27 percent of voters said they were more worried about the protests, some of which have turned violent, than about the death of Mr. Floyd and police conduct. Among white voters, that figure was just 30 percent. 

“With the video footage we are now seeing, even the typical voter who’s all for law and order is not going to be able to ignore the fact that in some police departments, in the department themselves, they lack law and order,” said Representative Anthony G. Brown, Democrat of Maryland.Mr. Brown likened this moment to the violence that law enforcement inflicted on civil rights protesters in the 1960s, which he said was when “decent Americans woke up and said, ‘Hey, that’s wrong, we have to do something.’”

Just as there were divisions in the civil rights movement between older leaders and younger, more radical activists, however, some of the same generational differences exist today.

“I’ve seen this in neighborhood meetings where a young person will come in and say, ‘We have too many police officers here,’ and I’ll see a senior saying, ‘Oh, no, no, that’s not true,’” said Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, a Democrat.

This split has also found its way into the ranks of Democratic lawmakers. On Monday, Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina — who is now the highest-ranking black member of Congress but, in his youth, was jailed during protests — complained on a private conference call with other lawmakers about those trying to “hijack” the swelling movement with calls to defund the police.

Later on the call, however, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, 30, warned against actions that would “demoralize or undercut” protest leaders, according to a House Democratic official familiar with the conversation.

Mr. Biden has sought to avoid inflaming either constituency. In his speech last week, he was blunt that the story of America “isn’t a fairy tale.” Yet he invoked the Civil War, the Great Depression and often bloody civil rights protests to argue that “in some of our darkest moments of despair, we’ve made some of our greatest progress.”

Representative Colin Allred of Texas said that recalling past crises and the progress that emerged from them was a way to assure voters that better days are ahead while also recalling pre-Trump presidential leadership — “a call for change and a call for restoration,” as Mr. Allred, a Democrat, put it.

In the swing state of Nevada, Chris Giunchigliani, a Democratic former member of the Clark County Commission, warned her party that incremental improvements to policing would not be enough. Making a few changes at the federal level and then declaring victory, she said, might “give people false hope that things are fixed,” when an overhaul would require meticulous work at the state and local level.

“To folks who want to defund: You need a police department, I think that’s reasonable,” said Ms. Giunchigliani, a former candidate for governor. “But I think it’s time to take a step back and work on: What should policing in the community be?”

As encouraging as the polling on police issues is for Democrats right now, many in the party are wary of putting too much confidence in the expressions of support from white voters who have historically recoiled from seeing public officials at odds with law enforcement.

Partly for that reason, black leaders are eager to see Democrats press hard in the coming weeks for the moderate slate of policy changes proposed on Monday, in the hope that they could be passed swiftly in an environment that is favorable but could turn out to be fragile.

Marc Morial, the president of the National Urban League, said he believed the country was at a “transformative moment,” in which the killing of Mr. Floyd had shaken white voters from passive sympathy to active support for overhauling law enforcement.

“I think there’s always been support there, but I think it’s been muted,” said Mr. Morial, who served two terms as mayor of New Orleans. Now, he said, there’s a new majority and it’s not at all silent.

Protests Swell Across America as George Floyd Is Mourned Near His Birthplace,"MINNEAPOLIS — Protesters in Philadelphia stood on the steps of an art museum and demanded cuts to the city’s police budget. A crowd gathered outside the Minnesota governor’s mansion stood silently to hear stories from victims of police abuse. At a huge rally in Washington, demonstrators filled the streets, and speakers cried out to ensure that a death like that of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer never happen again.

Demonstrations across America that began as spontaneous eruptions of outrage over police violence appeared to have cohered by Saturday into a national mass protest movement against systemic racism, marked more by organization and determination than by street fury.

Protesters vowed to keep up the momentum toward overhauling what they said was a broken law enforcement system plagued by racial injustice. Some took credit for changes that have already occurred in some cities.

In Minneapolis, which has been convulsed with protests for the past 12 days, city officials announced measures on Friday that are meant to rein in aggressive police tactics, including a ban on chokeholds and strangleholds. And in Denver, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order on Friday to restrict the use by the police of rubber bullets and tear gas on protesters.

“I think we’re all just trying to keep the pressure on and make sure this issue stays at the forefront of the national discourse,” said Mary Levy, 50, a law professor at Temple University who was part of a throng of protesters outside the Philadelphia Museum of Art on Saturday afternoon.

Many of the day’s gatherings appeared larger than previous rallies, especially the one in Washington. At one point, it felt as if the entire city had emptied into downtown as lines of protesters snaked their way through side streets while others converged in nearby parks, eclipsing the turnout at prior protests.

Outside Lafayette Square, where federal law enforcement officers had forcibly evicted peaceful protesters last week, the atmosphere on Saturday was more like that of a street fair or a music festival. Cookies and Cool Ranch Doritos were arrayed on folding tables, and masks emblazoned with “I can’t breathe” were on sale along with Black Lives Matter T-shirts. Even portable toilets were on hand.

Marchers on 16th Street did a coordinated dance, “the wobble,” as the rapper V.I.C. blared through speakers. North of the White House, a Shake Shack handed out water.

For all that, the black chain-link fences forming a perimeter around the White House grounds had been reinforced with concrete Jersey barriers, and security personnel from an alphabet of agencies, including the National Guard, stood by in a kaleidoscope of uniforms, braced for any trouble.

Joelle Mitchell, 17, was unfazed as she made her way toward the White House. She had been working at a dog day care facility outside Annapolis, Md., all week, and this was her first day to join the protests.

She expressed surprise at how peaceful it all was, given the bleak news coverage she had seen about protests across the city and the country.

“It really is our responsibility that this doesn’t happen anymore,” Ms. Mitchell said.

As the protests were getting underway Saturday, mourners at a memorial service in the tiny railroad town of Raeford, N.C., passed by the plush blue coffin of Mr. Floyd, whose body was dressed in a tan suit and a brown tie. He was born in Fayetteville, about 25 miles away, and dozens of his relatives, including a sister, live in the area.

Mr. Floyd’s coffin arrived at the viewing, held at a Free Will Baptist church called Cape Fear Conference B, in a black hearse as a large group of people outside chanted “Black power,” “George Floyd!” and “No justice, no peace.” Some wore T-shirts printed with “I Can’t Breathe,” and a few carried small posters.

At the service, the local sheriff received a standing ovation when he said of the nation’s police officers, “We are part of the problem.”

The sheriff, Hubert A. Peterkin of Hoke County, N.C., told mourners that law enforcement officers must recognize and eliminate racism within their ranks. Looking directly at Mr. Floyd’s relatives in the front rows of the church, Sheriff Peterkin, who is black, said ingrained racism had led to Mr. Floyd’s death.

“If there were four brothers that threw a police officer on the ground and one of them put his knee on that officer’s neck and killed him on a video,” he said, there would have been “a national manhunt — and they would have been charged with murder immediately.”

Mr. Floyd’s body was transported from Minneapolis, where another memorial service was held last week. After the memorial on Saturday, it will be transported to Houston for a third memorial service and burial next week.

Mr. Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man, died May 25 after being handcuffed and pinned to the ground by a white police officer. Video widely shared on social media showed Mr. Floyd crying out for his mother and pleading that he couldn’t breathe. Many demonstrations now include 8 minutes 46 seconds of silence, marking the length of time the police officer’s knee was pressed into Mr. Floyd’s neck.

Demonstrations were continuing in Minneapolis on Saturday, still large but considerably calmer and more organized than last week, though no less passionate. Police officers hung back or did not appear at all at the rallies — a marked difference from the clashes between officers and protesters last weekend.

Outside Mayor Jacob Frey’s house, protesters shouted at him when he would not commit on the spot to abolishing the police department, local news outlets reported. They yelled “Go home, Jacob, go home!” and “Shame! Shame!” as he walked away from the crowd.

Hundreds of demonstrators stood in silence outside the governor’s mansion in neighboring St. Paul to hear relatives of a dozen men who had died in police custody share their experiences.

Amity Dimock spoke about her son Kobe E. Dimock-Heisler, a mentally ill 21-year-old who was fatally shot by police at home last year after reports that he was wielding a hammer and a knife while fighting with his grandparents, according to a local newspaper.

Ms. Dimock said the authorities had recently allowed the family to view video footage of Mr. Dimock-Heisler’s death, only after the new interest in transparency that had come about because of Mr. Floyd’s case. As she spoke, she broke down crying, and someone pulled up a chair for her.

Leigh Finke, 39, stood not far away, waving a Black Lives Matter flag in rainbow colors. She’s been protesting for nine days.

“Every day it feels better,” she said. “Finally things are starting to change a little bit.” Pointing to the ban on chokeholds and the City Council’s talking about reducing police budgets, she said, “That’s real change.”

As she spoke, a white woman drove by, yelling about Black Lives Matter, “It’s a racist movement — white lives matter!” A black protester wearing a veil responded: “That’s just your opinion.”

Rallies took place Saturday in small towns and suburbs, drawing hundreds of people to communities that in many cases had not yet held protests, as well as in major cities where marches with masked demonstrators toting Black Lives Matters signs have quickly become part of the daily fabric of pandemic life. The protests have also spread overseas to Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia.

So many protests sprang up across South Florida on Saturday that demonstrations filled the entire day. In the evening, hundreds of people embarked on a march along Biscayne Boulevard, the main thoroughfare in downtown Miami. The crowd was nearly equal parts black, white and Hispanic and ranged widely in age, with numerous families taking part. Police officers stayed in the background. At one march, students handed out Krispy Kreme doughnuts.

Groups of protesters in Los Angeles clustered in Plummer Park in the West Hollywood section, the scene of daily gatherings, and processions were held downtown, at the Cochran Avenue Baptist Church in the Miracle Mile neighborhood and all over the city. 

Darlene Chan, a book publicist who lives near Fairfax Avenue, which saw huge crowds and unrest a week ago, calls this the new normal: “Random, unexpected protests popping up all the time.”

Thousands of people marched peacefully across the Golden Gate Bridge, briefly bringing traffic to a halt.

“This is the awakening of America,” said one of the marchers, Nate Payne, who was wearing a gold San Francisco 49ers jacket and holding a cardboard cutout of a kneeling Colin Kaepernick, the former 49ers quarterback known for kneeling during the national anthem before games as a quiet protest against social injustice.

In Seattle, a demonstration organized by health care workers drew thousands who walked from Harborview Medical Center to City Hall, with many wearing scrubs and lab coats and carrying signs with slogans like “Black Health Matters” and “Racism Is a Public Health Emergency.” Seattle officials encouraged people who had attended recent protests to take advantage of free coronavirus testing sites that the city was opening.

Thousands of Philadelphians rallied peacefully at the steps of the art museum — famous from the film “Rocky” — calling for cuts of at least 10 percent of the budget for the city’s police department, one of the few city agencies that is set to get more funding in a new budget proposed by Mayor Jim Kenney in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Some participants said the mood was less charged than on earlier days in Philadelphia, when shops were looted and the police fired tear gas to control protesters.

“My sense is that the initial wave of anger has calmed down a little,” said Pat Oelschlager, 23, of Fort Washington, Pa. But the voices “still seem to be pretty loud, and it’s good to hear people making concrete demands.”

In New York City, thousands of people gathered near the northwest corner of Central Park for a demonstration called the March for Stolen Dreams and Looted Lives, and other events and marches in the city also drew sizable crowds.

Constance Malcolm, whose son Ramarley Graham was killed by a New York City police officer in his home in 2012, had to fight back tears before speaking into the megaphone.

“I’m tired of crying,” Ms. Malcolm said. “We need our voices to be heard. That’s happening now and we need to take advantage of it.”

She then had a simple directive: “Vote.”

"For Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis, a Stinging Rebuke","transcript

Jacob Frey, we have a yes or no question for you. Yes or no: Will you commit to defunding Minneapolis Police Department? What did I say? We don’t want no more police. Is that clear? We don’t want people with guns toting around in our community shooting us down. You haven’t answered. It is a yes or a no. It is a yes or a no. Will you defund the Minneapolis Police Department? All right, be quiet, you all. Be quiet. Because it’s important that we actually hear this. It’s important that we hear this because if you all don’t know, he’s up for re-election next year. [cheering] He’s up for re-election next year. And if he says no, guess what the [expletive] we’re going to do next year. What did you say? Louder, one more time. All right! You’re wasting our time. Get the [expletive] out of here. Get the [expletive] out. Go home, Jacob. Go home. Go home, Jacob. Go home. Go home, Jacob. Go home. Shame, shame, shame.

Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis retreated on Saturday through a sea of protesters yelling, “Go home, Jacob, go home!” and “Shame! Shame!” after he refused to commit to defunding the Police Department.

The scene in Minneapolis, which ricocheted across social media, reflected the intense pressure protesters nationwide are putting on elected officials to commit to sweeping changes in the nation’s law enforcement system after the death of George Floyd nearly two weeks ago.

Mr. Frey, a 38-year-old civil rights lawyer, swept into office in 2018 on promises to fix the broken relationship between the community and the police.

Across the country, calls to defund, downsize or abolish police departments have gained new traction since Mr. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man from Minneapolis, died after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes.

On Wednesday, Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles announced that he would cut as much as $150 million from a planned increase in the Police Department’s budget. And in New York, Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, and Daniel Dromm, a council member from Queens, vowed even before the latest protests to cut the Police Department’s $6 billion budget.

In Minneapolis, at least four members of the City Council have called for dismantling the Police Department, where four former officers have been charged in Mr. Floyd’s death.

“And when we’re done, we’re not simply gonna glue it back together,” Jeremiah Ellison, a member of the City Council, said on Twitter this week. “We are going to dramatically rethink how we approach public safety and emergency response.”

On Saturday, Mr. Frey was pressed to state his position on the issue by protesters who had massed outside his house.

Looming above the mayor on a stage, a woman with a microphone asked him if he would commit on the spot to defunding the Minneapolis Police Department.

“It is a yes or no,” she said, instructing the crowd to be quiet and reminding them that the mayor is up for re-election next year. “And if he says no, guess what we’re going to do next year,” she said, adding an expletive for emphasis.

She then handed the microphone to Mr. Frey, who said in a barely audible voice muffled by his face mask, “I do not support the full abolition of the police.”

With that, the protesters began their chants of “Go home, Jacob, go home!” and “Shame! Shame!”

On Sunday, Mr. Frey said in a phone interview that after he walked away from the protesters chanting it at him, he stayed for about 45 minutes answering questions from reporters and others.

He emphasized again that while he doesn’t support abolishing the Police Department, he supported “deep structural reform of a racist system.” Asked what such reforms might include, he mentioned overhauling collective bargaining by the city’s police union."
A Delicate Balance: Weighing Protest Against the Risks of the Coronavirus,"None of the plans for how the nation might safely emerge from the coronavirus lockdown involved thousands of Americans standing shoulder to shoulder in the streets of major cities or coughing uncontrollably when the authorities used tear gas to disperse them. No one planned on protesters being herded into crowded prison buses or left in crowded cells.

Before the eruption of outrage over the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, debates about reopening centered on whether states had adequate systems in place to detect and treat cases of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 110,000 people in the United States since the beginning of the year.

But as the protests against police brutality continue for a second week, public officials are warily watching for signs that an unanticipated end to social distancing on a mass scale has led to new cases of the virus. The question has become part of the politicized debate over the economic repercussions of the lockdown, which some critics have argued went too far.

And on Sunday, infectious disease experts on Twitter debated how to supply a reliable estimate of the impact of the protests on virus transmission — or whether trying to do so may wrongly be seen as discouraging participation in the growing racial justice movement.

In what he called a back-of-the-envelope estimate, Trevor Bedford, an expert on the virus at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, wrote on Twitter that each day of protests would result in about 3,000 new infections. Over several weeks, as each infected person infected just under one other person on average — the current U.S. transmission rate — those infections would in turn lead to 15,000 to 50,000 more, and 50 to 500 eventual deaths. Given the racial disparities so far in the pandemic, he noted, those deaths will be disproportionately among black people. “Societal benefit of continued protests must be weighed against substantial potential impacts to health,” he wrote.

Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard, agreed that those projections were reasonable, and said in an email that Dr. Bedford had done “a service” by making an approximate estimate with explicit assumptions.

But he also noted that if states where the virus was still spreading managed to rein it in, that would “massively overshadow the effects of the protests.” About 20,000 new cases are identified across the country on most days, and about 1,000 new deaths are announced. If all communities were performing enough tests and contact tracing to bring down those numbers, fewer of those acquiring infections at protests would infect others, shortening the transmission chain and reducing the number of eventual deaths. 

Dr. Bedford wrote that his estimates contained a lot of uncertainty. There is no official estimate for how many people are protesting on an average day, for instance. Still, he thought it was important, he said, to provide a framework grounded in epidemiologic principles to counter the offhand assumptions being made by political pundits. But, in response, other scientists voiced concern that Dr. Bedford’s posts would “give fodder to those opposing civil rights.”

Many epidemiologists, including Dr. Bedford, have noted in recent days that America’s entrenched racial inequalities themselves translate into disproportionate early deaths and illness among African-Americans. That has been especially evident in the coronavirus pandemic, in which black Americans are dying at about twice the rate of white Americans. A group of more than 1,000 people working in health and medicine signed a letter recently that said protests were, in fact, vital to public health.

“Racism and police violence are major threats to public health in this country, and protest is one of the only options available to people who have been systematically disenfranchised,” said Eleanor Murray, an epidemiologist at Boston University.

Because it can take up to two weeks for a newly infected person to show symptoms and the protests started shortly after Mr. Floyd’s death, health experts expect that any increase in cases will begin to surface this week. Demonstrators in several places have contracted the virus, including in Lawrence, Kan., where someone who attended a protest last weekend tested positive on Friday. That person did not wear a mask while protesting, local officials said. In Athens, Ga., a county commissioner who attended a protest said that she had tested positive.

In Oklahoma, a college football player who participated in a demonstration revealed that he later tested positive for the virus.

“After attending a protest in Tulsa AND being well protective of myself, I have tested positive for Covid-19,” Amen Ogbongbemiga, a linebacker at Oklahoma State University, wrote on Twitter. “Please, if you are going to protest, take care of yourself and stay safe.”

Many did their best. In Califoria, Jarrion Harris, 32, wore a cloth mask for a march in Hollywood on Sunday. 

“I’m definitely not out here because I think Covid-19 has gone into the shadows,” he said. “It’s worth the risk.”

Politicians and public health officials have urged demonstrators to wear face coverings and to maintain social distancing. In some places, including Atlanta, Illinois, Los Angeles and Minnesota, officials have also urged protesters to seek coronavirus tests to make sure they have not become infected.

The surge of protests throughout American cities and the seeming support of some political leaders have not gone unnoticed on the right. Pundits and commentators have made the point in recent days that mayors and governors who sternly warned against public gatherings are now giving their blessing to the protests.

Dr. Tom Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who was appointed by President Barack Obama, tweeted last week that the threat to controlling the coronavirus was “tiny” compared with the threat “created when governments act in ways that lose community trust.”

That struck Jonah Goldberg, a writer for The Dispatch, an online conservative magazine, as an unfair double standard.

“You know what erodes public trust in people like Frieden?” Mr. Goldberg wrote. “When they say that you’re a fool or monster who will get people killed for wanting to go to church or keep your business open but you’re a hero when you join a protest they approve of.”

As the virus has spread across the country, many conservatives have rebelled against the stringent measures supported by public health experts, and there have been skirmishes over wearing masks in public, allowing in-person religious services and placing a premium on restoring the economy over other concerns.

If the virus surges again, said Christopher F. Rufo, director of the Center on Wealth and Poverty at the Discovery Institute, a conservative think tank, the experts’ standing will have been undermined. “You’re going to have half the country that has lost faith almost completely in the public health establishment,” he said.

But it may be hard to trace infections to other protesters, who are often marching side by side with strangers. And infectious disease experts have said that any increase in cases may well be the result of the continued reopening of restaurants, workplaces and mass transit.

In Las Vegas, casinos are reopening. In New York City, long the center of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, as many as 400,000 workers on Monday can begin returning to construction jobs, manufacturing sites and retail stores as the city enters the first phase of its reopening.

“You cannot pin this on the protests,” said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, whose projections of the virus’s path suggest that U.S. coronavirus deaths will increase in the coming weeks. “The protests are not in and of themselves going to drive the resurgence in cases. This is associated with all the new opportunities that are providing a way for people to get together and pass the virus to one another.”

For their part, activists said the drive to protest in the face of the virus reflected the larger gravity of the moment and the intensity of their passion.

“If I get infected fighting for justice, my soul can sit with that,” said Sara Semi, 27, a protester in Minneapolis who wears a mask with a filter and carries cans of disinfectant spray. “I can’t sit at home protected by my privileges if others aren’t. I can’t sit inside my house safe while my friends and neighbors are not. Yes, corona is happening. It’s real, it’s deadly. But racism kills way more lives.”

Vidal Guzman, 29, a protester in New York, said: “People are more scared of the police than Covid-19. They are willing to do anything.”

 Different conditions and the many remaining unknowns about how the virus is transmitted can make it difficult to predict the spread of the virus at any given protest. Outdoor gatherings are much lower risk than indoor ones. How many people are wearing masks, whether they are shouting or using noisemakers and even the weather may all affect the risk of infection.

Still, expert say it is within the power of law enforcement authorities to minimize or eliminate some of the chief risk factors, like arrests and tear gas. And they add that protesters, if they choose to take to the streets, should do everything they can to stay safe.

“If you attended a protest,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said on Sunday, “assume you may have been exposed to Covid. Get tested.”

D.C.’s Mayor Fights for Control of Her City at Trump’s Front Door,"WASHINGTON — After federal law enforcement agents and military troops lined up for days against protesters outside the White House, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington responded emphatically on Friday: She had city workers paint “Black Lives Matter” in giant yellow letters down a street she has maintained command of that is at the center of the confrontations.

The strong poke to President Trump within sight of his home underscored a larger power struggle between the two leaders over which one — the Democratic head of the District of Columbia or the president headquartered there — should decide who controls the streets that Mr. Trump has promised to dominate during protests over the killing last month of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis.

Ms. Bowser, a Washington native long steeped in city politics, again called on Mr. Trump on Friday to pull back all federal law enforcement officers and National Guard troops patrolling the city, including unidentified agents in riot gear, and said she would stop paying for the hotels for the Utah National Guard that she does not want in the city to begin with.

She renamed as Black Lives Matter Plaza the area in front of Lafayette Square where federal officials used chemical spray and smoke grenades on Monday to clear protesters ahead of Mr. Trump’s photo op at a historic church that faces the road that Ms. Bowser had painted. (The money for the paint job came out of the city’s mural program, city officials said.)

“We’re here peacefully as Americans on American streets,” Ms. Bowser said at the scene, standing near a sign reading, “Support D.C. Statehood.” “On D.C. streets.”

Mr. Trump, who has tried to appeal to his base by proclaiming himself a president of law and order, escalated the fight, calling Ms. Bowser “incompetent” on Twitter.

Ms. Bowser “who’s budget is totally out of control and is constantly coming back to us for ‘handouts,’ is now fighting with the National Guard, who saved her from great embarrassment,” Mr. Trump wrote. “If she doesn’t treat these men and women well, then we’ll bring in a different group of men and women!”

Ms. Bowser met this with her usual cool shrug. Asked about the president calling her incompetent, she said, “You know the thing about the pot and the kettle?”

Still, Trump officials appeared determined to make the standoff personal. Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, further belittled Ms. Bowser on Twitter by comparing her request to reduce the number of federal troops in Washington with the mentally ill wanting less medication.

While Mr. Trump has clashed with governors and mayors in recent months over his administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic and deployment of the National Guard in their streets during nationwide protests of police killings, his face-off with Ms. Bowser pits the president in his current home, the international symbol of the United States, against the city in which it sits, one that lacks the self-governing authorities of other states and cities.

While the city’s mayors have long pushed for statehood — Washington has no voting representation in Congress, a fact denounced on its license plates — Ms. Bowser has been a particularly forceful voice in favor of rights and autonomy for the district as its population and federal tax contributions have swelled.

This week, as the mayor managed the federal takeover and huge protests in the city’s central business district in the middle of a pandemic, she had seen enough.

“Our approach is three-pronged,” John Falcicchio, her chief of staff, said in an interview. “We are going to say what we think is the right thing to happen, we are going to question their tactics, and we are going to show that we are actually in control.”

Mr. Trump and Attorney General William P. Barr have deployed the full arsenal of federal government law enforcement personnel, including officers from the Bureau of Prisons and Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well as Border Patrol agents.

This week, the Trump administration also floated using an obscure provision to take control of Ms. Bowser’s Metropolitan Police Department, but did not follow through.

The federal authorities — which also include officers from Homeland Security Investigations, the Secret Service, the Transportation Security Administration and the Federal Protective Service — are expected to maintain their presence through Saturday, when thousands of demonstrators plan to march to the White House.

Ms. Bowser, with the support of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, has accused the Trump administration of escalating tensions with demonstrators, including by positioning officers without identifying insignia face-to-face with protesters.

“These additional, unidentified units are operating outside of established chains of command,” Ms. Bowser wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump that her office released Friday. “This multiplicity of forces can breed dangerous confusion.”

The mayor also planned to write to governors who had deployed National Guard troops to Washington, asking them to call the units home.

Before Mr. Floyd’s killing, Ms. Bowser and Mr. Trump had engaged in cordial dialogue. The two had at least two phone calls in recent months to discuss coronavirus funding for Washington, according to a person familiar with the conversations, who said the two leaders got along during them.

After one of their calls, Mr. Trump announced on Twitter that Washington’s transit system would be receiving more than $876 million in federal funding, congratulating Ms. Bowser and calling it “a big boost.”

She responded with a tweet thanking the president for the call, but noted her administration would continue seeking an additional $775 million in stimulus funding “to make DC whole.”

But shortly after Mr. Trump lashed out at Ms. Bowser on Friday on Twitter, a lobbyist with close ties to the president announced the termination of a contract with the city government.

The lobbyist, Brian Ballard, a top fund-raiser for Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign, had entered into an agreement on May 15 to press Congress for additional coronavirus relief funding for Washington, according to a filing posted Friday.

While the District of Columbia is often treated like a state for the purposes of federal funding allocation, it was instead treated like a territory in the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill signed by Mr. Trump in March. The classification meant Washington received only about $500 million, compared with a minimum of $1.25 billion allocated to each state, despite Washington’s being harder hit by the virus than most states. Its population of 705,000 is also larger than two states’.

Mr. Ballard’s firm had been pushing for Washington to retroactively receive the $750 million difference and to be treated like a state in any future coronavirus stimulus legislation, according to a person familiar with the effort.

“We are no longer in a position to deliver effective representation,” the firm wrote, “so we have respectfully withdrawn our engagement.”

The federal government has great control of the District of Columbia, an artifact of the Constitution that was updated in the 1970s with a federal law that gave the city partial autonomy, but allowed Congress to have vast powers over its laws and budget. Its National Guard is the only one out of the 54 states and territories that reports to the president.

Congress has invoked its will on the city several times over the years, blocking its needle exchange program at the height of the AIDS crisis, prohibiting the city from using its money to pay for abortions for poor women, pressing a charter school agenda on its education system and trying to block the city from requiring that most residents have health insurance. After Washington’s residents voted in 2014 to legalize the possession of marijuana — the same election that sent Ms. Bowser to the mayor’s office — Congress moved to nullify that.

During Ms. Bowser’s tenure, the city has continued along a rapid path of gentrification and has seen increases in crime and startling inequities in its school system, housing market and employment. The racial disparities in death rates between black and white residents are among the highest in the nation. Critics have accused Ms. Bowser of being too closely aligned with big developers; the city’s government, like the rest of the Democratic Party, is increasingly fractured between newer progressive members and those like Ms. Bowser who remain boosters of the business community.

And on Friday, the Washington chapter of Black Lives Matter tweeted that the mayor’s move to paint the mural in front of the White House was “a performative distraction from real policy changes.”

“We are still a city that is still deeply inequitable,” said Markus Batchelor, a candidate for the City Council who represents one of Washington’s poorest neighborhoods on its State Board of Education. “We invest more on the Police Department and corrections than on programs related to jobs, youth and mental health combined. So those are the things that really don’t translate in these public overtures of Black Lives Matter.”

Why Most Americans Support the Protests,"Welcome to Poll Watch, our weekly look at polling data and survey research on the candidates, voters and issues that will shape the 2020 election.

Beyond the scenes of protest and resistance playing out in cities across the country, a movement of a different sort has taken hold.

The American public’s views on the pervasiveness of racism have taken a hard leftward turn over the past few years. Never before in the history of modern polling have Americans expressed such widespread agreement that racial discrimination plays a role in policing — and in society at large.

Driven by the Black Lives Matter movement, this shift has primed the country for a new groundswell — one that has quickly earned the sympathy of most Americans, polling shows. As a result, in less than two weeks, it has already forced local governments and national politicians to make tangible policy commitments.

In a Monmouth University poll released this week, 76 percent of Americans — including 71 percent of white people — called racism and discrimination “a big problem” in the United States. That’s a 26-percentage-point spike since 2015. In the poll, 57 percent of Americans said demonstrators’ anger was fully justified, and another 21 percent called it somewhat justified.

In the Monmouth poll, and in another released this week by CBS News, exactly 57 percent of Americans said police officers were generally more likely to treat black people unfairly than to mistreat white people. In both surveys, about half of white people said so. This was a drastic change, particularly for white Americans, who have not historically said they believed that black people continued to face pervasive discrimination.

“There’s definitely been a seismic shift in the country,” said Steve Phillips, a civil rights lawyer and political analyst who founded the advocacy group Democracy in Color.

He pointed to what might have sounded like a radical demand just a few years ago — cutting funding for police departments and redirecting it toward social services — and noted that it has now been openly embraced by some mayors and police chiefs, in cities including Los Angeles. “I was interested to see how that would play itself out, and now they’re doing it — it’s actually happening,” Mr. Phillips said.

Also this week, lawmakers in Washington have pushed to end a program that sends military equipment to local police departments, and House Democrats have vowed to unveil a sweeping police-reform bill by next week. On the campaign trail, Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Tuesday said that if elected president, he would immediately set up a national police oversight commission.

In 2009, the year President Barack Obama took office, just 36 percent of white Americans said the country needed to do more to ensure that black people gained equal rights, according to a Pew Research Center poll. By 2017, four years after the start of the Black Lives Matter movement, that number had leapt to 54 percent of white people and roughly three in five Americans over all.

Sixty-one percent of the country in that poll said it supported Black Lives Matter.

While polls can tell us only what people say they believe — and could therefore be affected by a respondent’s desire to sound politically correct — a 2018 study by two social psychologists determined that even people’s implicit attitudes had shifted during the Black Lives Matter movement.

That study asked over one million digital participants to quickly associate a series of faces (some black and some white) with a series of words. The researchers found that during and after the protests, people were less likely to immediately associate black people’s images with negative words, or to quickly tie white people to positive ones.

Anup Gampa, a social psychologist at Harvey Mudd College in California and one of the authors of the study, said the shift in attitudes had occurred among people of all ages, and among conservatives as well as liberals. “Based on our findings, I wouldn’t be surprised if these protests have moved even white conservative attitudes to be more pro-black or anti-racist,” he said in an interview, referring to the recent demonstrations.

Mr. Phillips said the shift in attitudes spearheaded by the Black Lives Matter movement had extended even to the way protesters were operating.

“Much of the road map for how to engage on these issues has been put forward, and so when this happened there was more clarity, I think, around how to respond,” he said. “At some of these protests, they’ve had the white people form the outer ring. So there’s an awareness there that hasn’t been.”

Just before the current round of protests swept the nation, the Princeton professor Omar Wasow published research in which he found that Democratic candidates did better in the wake of nonviolent protest movements organized by black leaders — while Republicans tended to benefit after violent uprisings.

But with a confrontational and sometimes messy gale of protests appearing to gain broad support, there is evidence to suggest that the calculus is not always so straightforward. There were scattered incidents of looting and arson during the peak of the Black Lives Matter movement, most notably in Ferguson, Mo., where Michael Brown was killed, and Baltimore, where Freddie Gray died, yet sentiment swung heavily in favor of the movement.

And a separate study, from a three-person team of political and social scientists, found that the Rodney King riots of 1992 helped to mobilize liberal white voters and African-Americans in Los Angeles, leading to a leftward shift in some city policies.

Douglas McLeod, a journalism professor at the University of Wisconsin who studies the impact of news coverage on social movements, said people consumed a wider variety of information today, pointing in particular to social media. This can help to circumvent what he called “several conventions in media coverage of social protest that work against the protesters” — including a tendency to focus on instances of protester violence, even when they’re relatively rare, and to privilege the accounts of those in uniform.

Dr. McLeod said that as videos showing police brutality against black people have appeared relentlessly on social media, they have helped persuade skeptical Americans that an endemic problem exists. “When these things accumulate over time, and we start to see more and more of these images, the evidence starts to become more incontrovertible,” he said.

The current round of protests is youth-led, and so too, to some degree, is the shift in nationwide sentiment. Millennials and members of Generation Z are far more likely to say they believe the police are prone to racist behavior. And according to a PBS/NPR/Marist College poll last year, members of those generations were more than twice as likely to support reparations for slavery, compared with baby boomers and others in older generations.

A Pew survey in 2018 also found a stark generational divide over whether N.F.L. players were right to kneel in protest of racial inequality. Among millennials and teenagers in Generation Z, more than three in five expressed approval of the protests; among baby boomers and other older Americans, an equally large share said they disapproved.

Similar trends play out specifically among young black people and other people of color, who express a greater desire for sweeping change, and a more unanimous suspicion of the police. In a recent Washington Post/Ipsos poll of African-Americans, among respondents 35 and under, nine out of 10 said they did not trust the police to treat people of all races equally — higher than in any other age group.

In this week’s Monmouth poll, most Americans continued to express at least some level of satisfaction with their local police departments. Still, the poll reflected a new willingness — across generations — to say that the police tend to show racial bias.

A similar trend has occurred over the past few years with regard to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency responsible for enforcing the country’s immigration laws. It has become the least popular federal agency, according to data from the Pew Research Center.

In a March poll, Americans were just as likely to disapprove of the agency as they were to approve. Of the other nine agencies Pew asked about, none had less than 60 percent approval.

Long before he declared himself “your law and order president” this week, essentially positioning himself against the protesters, President Trump had put support for law enforcement at the center of his political identity. In the process, he has often singled out ICE for praise.

In this case, as in so many others, Mr. Trump’s combative brand of politics tends to draw clear dividing lines: Whether you support him will usually coincide fairly cleanly with your stance on any number of issues. Yet throughout his presidency, he has commanded a minority coalition. That’s certainly true now, with his approval rating stuck in the low 40s.

As he embraces harsh tactics against protesters, and seeks to label many of those fighting for racial justice as “domestic terrorists,” he has helped force a commitment one way or the other. And for the moment, a large and growing majority appears to be choosing the other side.

The Public Religion Research Institute was in the midst of a nationwide poll last week when the first protests broke out over George Floyd’s killing. The group’s researchers found that as demonstrations ramped up, Mr. Trump’s favorability rating fell significantly among certain key voting groups.

In the first three days of the poll, May 26 to 28, 40 percent of political independents expressed a positive view of the president; in interviews conducted over the three days that followed — starting on May 29, when Mr. Trump tweeted, “when the looting starts, the shooting starts” — his approval among independents dropped to 30 percent. Among white Christians, the dip was 11 points. Among seniors, his rating fell especially hard: from 58 percent to 41 percent.

"
Democrats to Propose Broad Bill to Target Police Misconduct and Racial Bias,"Democrats in Congress plan to unveil expansive legislation on Monday that would make it easier to prosecute police misconduct and recover damages from officers found to have violated the constitutional rights of civilians, and step up pressure on the Justice Department to address systemic racial discrimination by law enforcement.

The bill, which House and Senate Democrats have named the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, is a direct response to the recent killings of three black Americans by white civilians and officers that have prompted protests across the country, but it includes policies that civil rights activists have been pushing for decades to combat racial bias and excessive use of force by law enforcement. The New York Times obtained a copy of a section-by-section summary of its contents, circulated privately on Capitol Hill late Friday.

It would be the most aggressive intervention into policing by Congress in recent memory, and elements of it are certain to meet with staunch opposition from politically powerful police unions and other law enforcement groups that have fought against such efforts in the past. It is not clear whether President Trump, who often aligns himself with law enforcement and has advocated the use of brutal police tactics, will embrace such measures now.

As currently proposed, it would significantly change federal law and require states and localities to make modifications of their own, such as instituting mandatory bias training, to receive federal funds. It would create a national registry to track police misconduct and require that law enforcement agencies report data on the use of force, as well as ban certain chokeholds and other practices that were used in confrontations with the police that left black Americans dead.

“Persistent, unchecked bias in policing and a history of lack of accountability is wreaking havoc on the black community,” House and Senate Democrats who assembled the package wrote in an email to colleagues on Friday accompanying the summary. “Cities are literally on fire with the pain and anguish wrought by the violence visited upon black and brown bodies.”

The effort is being led by Representative Karen Bass of California, the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, and Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, the only two black Democrats in the Senate. They cited the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky that have inspired protests across the country, as well as other well-known victims of such force in recent years.

“While there is no single policy prescription that will erase the decades of systemic racism and excessive policing — it’s time we create structural change with meaningful reforms,” the lawmakers wrote.

The text of the bill was still being drafted on Saturday and could change before Monday’s unveiling, as could the legislation’s title.

Individual lawmakers in both parties have introduced their own proposals in recent days that the House and Senate could still consider going forward, but the bill by Ms. Bass and the others has the imprimatur of Democratic leadership in the House and Senate, as well as the influential black caucus. Democrats believe they will be able to swiftly pass it in the House, but prospects are less clear in the Senate, where the Republican majority is likely to pursue a narrower set of changes.

Because most police departments are under state and local control, there are limits to the kinds of changes Congress can mandate from Washington. Calls from activists to break up or drastically restructure police departments, for instance, are more likely to be answered at the state and local level.

Still, the changes Democrats are proposing would be significant.

If adopted, the bill would rewrite key elements of the federal criminal code related to police misconduct to make it easier to prosecute law enforcement officers and for individuals who are victims of such practices to recover damages.

The federal police misconduct statute currently makes it a crime for an officer to “willfully” violate an individuals’s constitutional rights, meaning prosecutors must prove an officer acted with the intention of depriving the person of their rights. Democrats plan to propose lowering that standard of criminal intent to “knowingly or with reckless disregard.” The change is likely to face opposition from police unions and their allies.

The legislation would also alter the legal doctrine known as qualified immunity that shields police officers from being held legally liable for damages sought by citizens whose constitutional rights were violated.

In addition, Democrats are proposing to change the federal standard for the use of force by officers from “reasonableness” to only when it is “necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury.” The bill would require that federal officers use de-escalation tactics and use deadly force only as a last resort. Grants to state and local agencies would require them to do the same.

In federal drug cases, lawmakers intend to propose banning “no knock” warrants, which allow police to enter a residence without warning or identifying themselves, and incentivize states to do the same. Ms. Taylor was shot and killed in her home during such a raid.

The legislation would also ban chokeholds or other carotid holds, and condition law enforcement funds on states and other agencies doing the same. The technique led to Mr. Floyd’s death, prosecutors have said, and the high-profile death in 2014 of Eric Garner in New York.

It would also limit the transfer of military weaponry to state and local departments.

It would give new power to Justice Department investigators conducting inquiries into patterns or practices of behavior by police departments that violate the Constitution and incentivize state attorneys general to conduct such investigations on their own.

Lawmakers would require all uniformed federal officers to wear body cameras and use dashboard cameras, which have been crucial tools to holding officers accountable in many cases, and they would mandate that state and local agencies use federal funds to “ensure” their use.

Democrats would also try to prod state and local law enforcement agencies to undertake a new effort to end discrimination in their practices, by conditioning federal funding on the adoption of policies and training to combat racial and other discriminatory profiling.

The bill would also impose new requirements on the Justice Department to assemble and promulgate new policing standards for state and local agencies and collect reams of data on police actions all over the country that could inform more changes in the future, particularly when a Democratic administration controls the department.

The bill would also include a provision, held up in the Senate, that would make lynching a new federal hate crime for the first time in American history."
In Videos: Protests Against Police Violence Rage Across the U.S.,"Some are ground-level recordings, shakily shot by protesters clashing with police officers who are firing pepper spray or charging ahead with riot shields. Others offer an eerily serene bird’s-eye view, shot from a helicopter, of thousands of demonstrators moving through city streets down below.

Whether uploaded, streamed or shown on a seemingly continuous loop on television, video — much of it spreading on social media — has become the central lens through which Americans have viewed the nationwide unrest that has followed the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis.

It was a bystander’s video of a white police officer kneeling on Mr. Floyd’s neck as he gasped for air that helped bring his death to national attention and increased pressure on prosecutors to bring charges against the four officers involved. That video was only the latest in a ghastly compendium of police officers captured on camera brutalizing black people, dating at least to the grainy video of Los Angeles officers beating Rodney King in 1991.

Now, as protests — some destructive, others peaceful — shake up hundreds of American cities, videos continue to define the moment. Filled with screaming voices and flashes of light, the videos can be shocking. Some show violent confrontations between the police and demonstrators. Some capture looters smashing store windows. Still others convey tender moments of solidarity, or outraged speeches, crying for justice.

Carrying umbrellas and waving their hands, protesters in New York sang “Happy Birthday” for Breonna Taylor, an African-American emergency room technician who was fatally shot in March by police officers in Louisville, Ky. She would have turned 27 on Friday. Outside the Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building in Harlem, people also sang, cheered and clapped.

A video taken by WBFO, a local radio station, shows Buffalo police officers shoving a 75-year-old protester, who was hospitalized with a head injury. Prosecutors are investigating the actions of two officers, who were suspended without pay. The protester was in “serious but stable condition” Friday afternoon.

The New York Times analyzed videos of the fatal shooting of David McAtee, a restaurant owner in Louisville, Ky., by the police and the National Guard on June 1 to show how the episode unfolded — and how challenged policing tactics played a role.

transcript

[gunshots] Police and National Guardsmen in Kentucky are under investigation after David McAtee, a restaurant owner in Louisville, was shot and killed during a heightened moment in the city, when people were protesting police violence. Crowd: “Breonna Taylor!” Kentucky’s governor released videos of the incident, and says police were responding to gunfire when McAtee was shot. But that doesn’t tell the whole story. The Times analyzed those videos, police scanner audio and a livestream filmed by a bystander. We synchronized the videos precisely by lining up key moments, allowing us to see — and most critically, hear — what happened from four different angles. We’ll see how the episode started, and how questionable policing tactics resulted in a fatal outcome. It’s just after midnight on Monday, June 1, when police and National Guardsmen arrive at a busy intersection in West Louisville. They’ve been sent to enforce a dusk-to-dawn curfew imposed by Louisville’s mayor. David McAtee, also known as Yaya, is in his barbecue stand, smoking food for customers. Across the street at Dino’s Food Mart, a local resident, Chris Smith, is livestreaming to Facebook as he hangs out with friends. “We out here. We out here.” His video will provide us with audio of critical moments. “Hold on.” “Police just came.” “Go. In the car and leave, just go.” “I‘m gone, soon as I get my keys.” As the area by Dino’s is cleared, a police officer and guardsman cross the street toward Yaya’s. One police officer readies a weapon as they approach the area. It appears to be a modified paintball gun which the Louisville police used to fire pepper balls, like you see in this footage from a previous incident. “… at us, like, directly at us.” While crossing the street, the officer aims it at the bystanders near Yaya’s, and fires a pepper ball into the curb. Immediately, diners to the front of Yaya’s hurry back along the alleyway, and take shelter inside the building through a side door. McAtee, who hasn’t seen what happened, approaches the doorway from inside. He appears to have a gun holstered on his right hip. McAtee and his niece stand by the door and peer outside. There appears to be no immediate threat to the officers at this moment, but one of them immediately fires at least two pepper balls at them. Let’s watch this back, side by side. McAtee and his niece are by the door. A police officer is aiming the pepper-ball gun at the door. As they peer out, one pepper ball pierces a soda bottle, which falls from the table. Another strikes the doorway, and just misses the head of McAtee’s niece. She ducks and falls back inside. In response, McAtee appears to fire his handgun out the side door. It’s unclear where he’s aiming. [gunshot] “Front door.” We’ll replay this moment from different camera angles to show what happens. The livestream from Dino’s picks up this gunshot. “Where you going? I saw you at the site.” [shouting] The police and guardsmen nearest the restaurant immediately retreat. The officer who fired pepper balls now draws a handgun. “Shots fired, shots fired.” Another officer radios into dispatch, and others take cover in the area. “Shots fired northwest side.” Eight seconds later, McAtee peers out again, and again raises his arm. [gunshots] The same police officer, two guardsmen and another officer fire 18 rounds at McAtee. He stumbles inside, drops a handgun and collapses to the ground. One bullet hit his chest. Louisville police guidelines say officers must avoid the use of force when trying to disperse nonviolent crowds. They must also ID themselves, issue a dispersal order and give people reasonable time to disperse. None of that appears to have happened here. A day after the shooting, the assistant police chief described how officers use pepper balls. “It is police policy when we use pepper-ball spray to actually shoot at the ground.” That also did not happen. Pepper balls were fired into the doorway where people were standing. Kentucky governor, Andy Beshear, said the investigation will continue, and urged the public to examine the video footage frame by frame. “And people can see with their own eyes, and make determinations with their own eyes.” “What do we want?” “Justice.” “When do we want it?” “Now.” “What do we want?” “Justice.” “When do we want it?” “Now.”

“I’m just trying to grab my phone out of my pocket.” “The other hand.” “OK, OK, my neck is being pressed against my helmet.

Please let this video show that I’m not resisting in the slightest. They just keep jerking me around. I don’t understand this. I don’t understand this. God bless you all for recording, make sure their badge numbers are being recorded. That’s my property.” “Can you fix my mask?” “You are in violation of the curfew.” “Can you please fix my mask?” “You are in violation of the curfew.” “I’m a member of the press.”

Pounding on a chain-link fence and chanting, “Black lives matter,” protesters rallied outside the White House. The crowd also chanted: “What’s his name? George Floyd!”

Protesters booed Mayor Bill de Blasio during his remarks at a memorial for George Floyd in Brooklyn. People turned their backs on the mayor and chanted “Resign” and “I can’t breathe,” drowning out his roughly 90-second speech.

George Floyd!” [crowd chanting] “I thank you for being here … … let me tell you something: All of us who have not walked a mile in the shoes of the black community, communities of color, for all of us who know white privilege, we need do more because we don’t even fully recognize —” [crowd boos] Crowd: “George Floyd! George Floyd! George Floyd! George Floyd!”

In his first on-camera remarks since the protests began, former President Barack Obama told young people of color, “I want you to know that you matter.”

transcript

I want to speak directly to the young men and women of color in this country, who as Playon just so eloquently described have witnessed too much violence and too much death. And too often some of that violence has come from folks who we’re supposed to be serving and protecting you. I want you to know that you matter. I want you to know that your lives matter, that your dreams matter. And when I go home and I look at the faces of my daughters, Sasha and Malia, and I look at my nephews and nieces, I see limitless potential that deserves to flourish and thrive. And you should be able to learn and make mistakes, and live a life of joy without having to worry about what’s going to happen when you walk to the store, or go for a jog, or driving down the street, or looking at some birds in a park. And so I hope that you also feel hopeful, even as you may feel angry, because you have the power to make things better. And you have helped to make the entire country feel as if this is something that’s got to change. You’ve communicated a sense of urgency that is as powerful and as transformative as anything that I’ve seen in recent years.

Hundreds of protesters sat silently in front of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s home on Wednesday, the eighth day of demonstrations around the country. Protests on Wednesday were largely peaceful, with demonstrators sitting quietly, dancing and singing, or marching.

As a citywide curfew fell on New York Wednesday for a third night, large numbers of protesters flouted the requirement that they clear the streets by 8 p.m., and the police responded with dozens of arrests.

Riot police officers confronted a crowd of protesters in Brooklyn on Wednesday night after curfew. Protesters numbered in the hundreds and stood peacefully, their hands up, chanting, “Don’t shoot.” Organizers tried to turn protesters around to leave, but they were surrounded by officers holding shields and batons who moved in from all sides.

Why Aren’t We All Talking About Breonna Taylor?,"— Andrea Ritchie, author of “Invisible No More: Police Violence Against Black Women and Women of Color”

[Follow our live Breonna Taylor decision and Louisville protests updates.]

Last week, Andrea Ritchie, a researcher at Barnard Center for Research on Women, joined thousands of others across the U.S. to take part in a protest demanding justice for George Floyd. She proudly chanted his name outside the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.

“But I was shocked that I didn’t hear anyone say Breonna Taylor’s name at any point,” Ritchie said, referring to the black emergency medical technician in Louisville, Ky., who was killed by the police in March, just weeks before Floyd’s death. Officers burst into Taylor’s apartment while she was asleep during a late night drug investigation using a so-called “no-knock warrant.” Her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, who has said he was worried someone was breaking into the apartment, shot and wounded an officer. The officers have said that they then returned fire and shot Taylor at least eight times in her own home. 

Her mother filed a lawsuit against the Louisville Metro Police Department in late April and people in Louisville started taking to the streets demanding justice in May. None of the officers in her case have been arrested or fired, though the F.B.I. is currently investigating the case.

In an effort to resurface Taylor’s story on social media, users started using the hashtag #SayHerName last week.

But even that, Ritchie noted, has been turned into #SayHisName.

“All black lives matter,” she said, adding that this movement should be striving to address police brutality against black men and women and LGBTQ people, who also face violence by law enforcement.

“We’re not trying to compete with Floyd’s story, we’re trying to complete the story,” said Ritchie, who is also the author of “Invisible No More: Police Violence Against Black Women and Women of Color.”

Senator Kamala Harris echoed that sentiment on Thursday. “We can’t forget about black women in our quest for justice,” she wrote on Twitter. 

Things started to shift on Friday, on what would have been Taylor’s 27th birthday. Protesters marched in her honor, some sang “Happy Birthday,” others brought balloons to protests or sent birthday cards to Kentucky’s attorney general, Daniel Cameron, demanding justice. The hashtag #BirthdayForBreonna was used widely on social media. 

Still, Taylor’s case remains largely disconnected with the broader national conversation that’s happening around George Floyd — no celebrities have offered to pay for her funeral or taken out full-page ads in newspapers across the country dedicated to her and few brands have started campaigns in her name. 

Perhaps it’s because there was no graphic video footage of the scene or because it all happened back in March at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. 

But her exclusion, and that of other black women, is the latest iteration of a longstanding issue: Black women’s experiences of police brutality and their tireless contributions to mass social justice movements have almost always been left out of the picture, receiving far less media or political attention.

For years, black women have faced a double bind of racial and gender discrimination.

According to a 2017 report by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, black women remain underrepresented in the political system, black women are more likely to work jobs that lack crucial benefits and protections, more black women live in poverty than any other group, black women experience higher rates of intimate partner violence, and the gender barriers in access to health care are higher for black women than white women.

The Covid-19 pandemic has deepened all of those fissures. The unemployment rate for black women is now 16.4 percent compared with 15.5 percent for women overall, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, leaving them in increasingly precarious positions.

When it comes to interactions with the police, the same racial biases that apply to black men apply to black women too, Ritchie said. Black women are more likely than white women to be pulled over in traffic stops, according to data from the Prison Policy Initiative. They are also more likely than white women to be incarcerated and currently make up the largest portion of women in local jails compared with other women of color. Black women also face brutal police violence, which frequently takes the form of sexual assault or harassment at the hands of officers, away from cameras and the public eye, Ritchie said. And, she added, alarmingly, it often occurs when officers are responding to calls for help from domestic violence or sexual assault.

It is in large part because of these layers of inequalities that black women have risen up to form the backbone of some of the largest civil rights movements in U.S. history — from abolition and suffrage to #MeToo.

“Some of our loudest voices against oppression have come from black women,” said Dr. Monique Morris, founder and board chair for the National Black Women’s Justice Institute. Young black girls too have been a big part of “the articulation of our democracy” — like 15-year-old Claudette Colvin, who refused to give up her seat on a bus months before Rosa Parks did the same. 

The Black Lives Matter movement was also founded by three women — Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi — who were angered by the acquittal in 2013 of George Zimmerman, the man who fatally shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.

“We did want to start a movement,” Cullors said. “Did we know we were going to be successful? No. But we worked hard, for years, making sure that people saw what was happening and how it was happening.”

Yet, movements tend to latch on to a singular ‘face’ or leader and, for many, that ideal image is predominantly still a straight man, Cullors said.

“It’s easier to be seduced by masculinity and the idea that we’re going to be saved by a black Christian male,” Cullors said, noting the appeal around Dr. Martin Luther King as an example. “That’s a problem. We don’t fully understand how racism and sexism and patriarchy and homophobia impact our community.”

Without that understanding, any proposed changes in police conduct or laws will be limited in scope and women’s concerns will continue to be overlooked, Ritchie said. For example, there currently isn’t any official data collection on police sexual misconduct, nationally or at the local level, Ritchie added, and changing that should be a part of the broader police reforms.

America needs an intersectional lens over what all black communities are experiencing and the strategies to address them, Dr. Morris said.

“We need to understand justice to be expansive,” she said.

Ella Jones Is Elected First Black Mayor of Ferguson,"Ella Jones became the first African-American and first woman elected mayor in Ferguson, Mo., on Tuesday, nearly six years after the city erupted in protests after a white police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, a black teenager, propelling Ferguson into the national spotlight and galvanizing the Black Lives Matter movement.

The victory for Ms. Jones, a Ferguson City Council member, came as another night of protests unfolded throughout the country over the killing of George Floyd and persistent police brutality against black Americans.

Ms. Jones, 65, and her opponent, Heather Robinett, 49, had both vowed to continue changes enacted after the 2014 shooting of Mr. Brown, including a federal consent decree, a legally binding agreement requiring reforms to a police department.

And both had made clear that they supported peaceful protests after the killing of Mr. Floyd in Minneapolis, while condemning the violence that has broken out in several cities.

“My election gives people hope,” Ms. Jones said in an interview Wednesday. “Everybody is looking for a change, everybody wants to have a better way of life. You don’t want to go four blocks and worry about getting shot, nobody wants that. It is starting to get better. We are making changes.”

“I have been living in injustice all my life,” she added. “I didn’t just get exposed to it because I became a City Council member.”

Ms. Jones, who prevailed with 54 percent of the vote, will succeed James Knowles III, who has been the mayor since 2011 and could not run for re-election because of term limits. Ms. Jones lost to Mr. Knowles in the 2017 mayoral election.

A resident of Ferguson for more than 40 years, Ms. Jones is also a pastor in the African Methodist Episcopal Church.

Protests convulsed Ferguson for weeks in 2014, after the white officer, Darren Wilson, shot and killed Mr. Brown, 18. A grand jury and the Department of Justice declined to prosecute Mr. Wilson, who eventually resigned.

In 2015, Ms. Jones became the first black woman elected to the City Council, and though she was critical of the city’s law enforcement system, she did not have enthusiastic backing from protesters at the time.

“I don’t get along to go along,” she said then. “If I see something that needs to be addressed, I will address it.”

After losing her bid for mayor, Ms. Jones said that many black residents told her that they did not believe electing her would change their own fortunes and questioned whether she had accomplished anything in her two years on the City Council.

“If you’ve been oppressed so long, it’s hard for you to break out to a new idea,” Ms. Jones said at the time. “And when you’ve been governed by fear and people telling you that the city is going to decline because an African-American person is going to be in charge, then you tend to listen to the rhetoric and don’t open your mind to new possibilities.”

Ferguson is one of the smallest cities in the country with a federal consent decree, which includes scores of new policies to reform the police department.

Like many other cities throughout the country, Ferguson officials declared a state of emergency and issued a curfew in recent days, as the protests over police brutality have continued."
A Crisis That Began With an Image of Police Violence Keeps Providing More,"SACRAMENTO — A protest movement that was ignited by a horrific video of police violence — a white police officer pressing his knee against the neck of George Floyd, a black man, for nearly nine minutes — has now prompted hundreds of other incidents and videos documenting violent tactics by police.

In Atlanta, a half-dozen officers have been criminally charged after bystanders tweeted footage of an abrupt attack on two college students sitting in a car during protests. In Austin, a 20-year-old protester shot in the head by police officers aiming at someone else with what’s described as nonlethal beanbag ammunition was left with a fractured skull and brain damage. Video shows volunteers being shot, too, as they carry him off.

In California, an officer sitting in a police car in Vallejo shot and killed a 22-year-old man who was on his knees with his hands up. Only later did the police discover that the man, who was suspected of trying to loot a Walgreens, had a hammer in his sweatshirt pocket, not a gun. The family’s lawyer says he has requested the videotape from body cam and store cameras, but police haven’t yet released them.



Cellphone videos show New York City police officers beating unarmed protesters and sideswiping demonstrators with opened squad car doors. Others around the country show the police indiscriminately using pepper spray on protesters or pedestrians. On live television, police officers in Louisville, Ky., fired pepper-spray balls at journalists.

transcript

It’s a Monday evening in Minneapolis. Police respond to a call about a man who allegedly used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. Seventeen minutes later, the man they are there to investigate lies motionless on the ground, and is pronounced dead shortly after. The man was 46-year-old George Floyd, a bouncer originally from Houston who had lost his job at a restaurant when the coronavirus pandemic hit. Crowd: “No justice, no peace.” Floyd’s death triggered major protests in Minneapolis, and sparked rage across the country. One of the officers involved, Derek Chauvin, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder. The other three officers have been charged with aiding and abetting murder. The Times analyzed bystander videos, security camera footage and police scanner audio, spoke to witnesses and experts, and reviewed documents released by the authorities to build as comprehensive a picture as possible and better understand how George Floyd died in police custody. The events of May 25 begin here. Floyd is sitting in the driver’s seat of this blue S.U.V. Across the street is a convenience store called Cup Foods. Footage from this restaurant security camera helps us understand what happens next. Note that the timestamp on the camera is 24 minutes fast. At 7:57 p.m., two employees from Cup Foods confront Floyd and his companions about an alleged counterfeit bill he just used in their store to buy cigarettes. They demand the cigarettes back but walk away empty-handed. Four minutes later, they call the police. According to the 911 transcript, an employee says that Floyd used fake bills to buy cigarettes, and that he is “awfully drunk” and “not in control of himself.” Soon, the first police vehicle arrives on the scene. Officers Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng step out of the car and approach the blue S.U.V. Seconds later, Lane pulls his gun. We don’t know exactly why. He orders Floyd to put his hands on the wheel. Lane reholsters the gun, and after about 90 seconds of back and forth, yanks Floyd out of the S.U.V. A man is filming the confrontation from a car parked behind them. The officers cuff Floyd’s hands behind his back. And Kueng walks him to the restaurant wall. “All right, what’s your name?” From the 911 transcript and the footage, we now know three important facts: First, that the police believed they were responding to a man who was drunk and out of control. But second, even though the police were expecting this situation, we can see that Floyd has not acted violently. And third, that he seems to already be in distress. Six minutes into the arrest, the two officers move Floyd back to their vehicle. As the officers approach their car, we can see Floyd fall to the ground. According to the criminal complaints filed against the officers, Floyd says he is claustrophobic and refuses to enter the police car. During the struggle, Floyd appears to turn his head to address the officers multiple times. According to the complaints, he tells them he can’t breathe. Nine minutes into the arrest, the third and final police car arrives on the scene. It’s carrying officers Tou Thao and Derek Chauvin. Both have previous records of complaints brought against them. Thao was once sued for throwing a man to the ground and hitting him. Chauvin has been involved in three police shootings, one of them fatal. Chauvin becomes involved in the struggle to get Floyd into the car. Security camera footage from Cup Foods shows Kueng struggling with Floyd in the backseat while Thao watches. Chauvin pulls him through the back seat and onto the street. We don’t know why. Floyd is now lying on the pavement, face down. That’s when two witnesses begin filming, almost simultaneously. The footage from the first witness shows us that all four officers are now gathered around Floyd. It’s the first moment when we can clearly see that Floyd is face down on the ground, with three officers applying pressure to his neck, torso and legs. At 8:20 p.m., we hear Floyd’s voice for the first time. The video stops when Lane appears to tell the person filming to walk away. “Get off to the sidewalk, please. One side or the other, please.” The officers radio a Code 2, a call for non-emergency medical assistance, reporting an injury to Floyd’s mouth. In the background, we can hear Floyd struggling. The call is quickly upgraded to a Code 3, a call for emergency medical assistance. By now another bystander, 17-year-old Darnella Frazier, is filming from a different angle. Her footage shows that despite calls for medical help, Chauvin keeps Floyd pinned down for another seven minutes. We can’t see whether Kueng and Lane are still applying pressure. Floyd: [gasping] Officer: “What do you want?” Bystander: “I’ve been —” Floyd: [gasping] In the two videos, Floyd can be heard telling officers that he can’t breathe at least 16 times in less than five minutes. Bystander: “You having fun?” But Chauvin never takes his knee off of Floyd, even as his eyes close and he appears to go unconscious. Bystander: “Bro.” According to medical and policing experts, these four police officers are committing a series of actions that violate policies, and in this case, turn fatal. They’ve kept Floyd lying face down, applying pressure for at least five minutes. This combined action is likely compressing his chest and making it impossible to breathe. Chauvin is pushing his knee into Floyd’s neck, a move banned by most police departments. Minneapolis Police Department policy states an officer can only do this if someone is, quote, “actively resisting.” And even though the officers call for medical assistance, they take no action to treat Floyd on their own while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. Officer: “Get back on the sidewalk.” According to the complaints against the officers, Lane asks him twice if they should roll Floyd onto his side. Chauvin says no. Twenty minutes into the arrest, an ambulance arrives on the scene. Bystander: “Get off of his neck!” Bystander: “He’s still on him?” The E.M.T.s check Floyd’s pulse. Bystander: “Are you serious?” Chauvin keeps his knee on Floyd’s neck for almost another whole minute, even though Floyd appears completely unresponsive. He only gets off once the E.M.T.s tell him to. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for over eight minutes, according to our review of the video evidence. Floyd is loaded into the ambulance. The ambulance leaves the scene, possibly because a crowd is forming. But the E.M.T.s call for additional medical help from the fire department. But when the engine arrives, the officers give them, quote, “no clear info on Floyd or his whereabouts,” according to a fire department incident report. This delays their ability to help the paramedics. Meanwhile, Floyd is going into cardiac arrest. It takes the engine five minutes to reach Floyd in the ambulance. He’s pronounced dead at a nearby hospital around 9:25 p.m. Preliminary autopsies conducted by the state and Floyd’s family both ruled his death a homicide. The widely circulated arrest videos don’t paint the entire picture of what happened to George Floyd. Crowd: “Floyd! Floyd!” Additional video and audio from the body cameras of the key officers would reveal more about why the struggle began and how it escalated. The city quickly fired all four officers. And Chauvin has been charged with second degree murder. Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao were charged with aiding and abetting murder. But outrage over George Floyd’s death has only spread further and further across the United States.



In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Miami Herald reporters filmed officers who were shooting a nonviolent protester in the head with foam rubber bullets, fracturing her eye socket and leaving her screaming and bloody. In Kansas City, Mo., the police walked onto a sidewalk to use pepper spray on protesters yelling at them.

“Move back!” “Hey!” [gasps] “He is bleeding!” “Bleeding out his ears, bleeding out of his ears.” “Call a medic! Call a medic!” “He’s bleeding out of his ear.” “Get a medic.” “What the [expletive] you walking up on me?” [unclear] “Oh [expletive].” “Back up. Back up. Get off the steps, let’s go, get back. Get back!” “Better get an ambulance for him.” “He’s — there — we have EMT on scene.”

In Buffalo, a video from WBFO, the local National Public Radio station, on Thursday showed police officers in riot gear shoving a 75-year-old man to the ground and walking away as he lay unconscious on the sidewalk, blood coming out of his ear.

A compilation of videotaped incidents posted on Twitter by a North Carolina lawyer stood at more than 300 clips by Friday morning.

The episodes have occurred in cities large and small, in the heat of mass protests and in their quiet aftermath. Some have occurred when the police confronted people who were suspected of looting. Experts on policing said that the videos showed, in many cases, examples of abrupt escalation on the part of law enforcement that was difficult to justify.

“It feels like the police are being challenged in ways that they haven’t been challenged in some time,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum. “They are responding. And sometimes, that response is totally inappropriate.”

Ed Obayashi, a California-based expert on the use of force by law enforcement, said the incidents, while often disturbing, were an overall improvement on past police conduct during episodes of unrest.

A lawyer who advises the California Association of Police Training Officers on use of force, Mr. Obayashi said that, considering the level of chaos across the nation, “from my standpoint, there’s been considerable restraint.”

The Los Angeles riots in 1992, he said, left more than 50 people dead and more than 1,000 injured just in that city. These protests have been national, involving thousands of officers and demonstrators in scores of cities, with far fewer deaths or injuries to civilians, and several have resulted in arrests, firings or internal investigations of officers.

“I’m seeing, consistently, a command-and-control system in place in many of these police departments and much better training,” he said. “In years past, you’d have officers going this way and that way with no organization. It was just everyone for himself and ‘Who can I catch?’”

Those improvements, however, have not necessarily changed the culture of rank-and-file law enforcement, said John Burris, a longtime civil rights lawyer in Oakland, Calif., who in 1994 helped represent Rodney King against the Los Angeles Police Department.

“From what I can see, for most of them, this is still just a moment to get through, like Ferguson,” said Mr. Burris, who is now representing the family of the unarmed man shot Tuesday just after midnight in a Vallejo parking lot. That shooting, he noted, was only the most recent for a department that, despite hiring a new chief last year, has had a long history of police abuse accusations.

“We’re seeing a lot of bad conduct by police officers throughout the nation,” Mr. Burris said. “And none of it suggests to me that they appreciate the rage people are feeling as a consequence of longstanding police brutality that has taken place in the African-American and Hispanic communities.”

One difference is that, in a number of cases, police departments are disciplining officers for their actions.

For example, after footage of the Buffalo incident went viral, the department suspended two officers and launched an internal affairs investigation. 

The United States Park Police said two officers were assigned to administrative duties after assaulting an Australian news crew in Lafayette Square in Washington on Monday. In Sacramento, police opened a use-of-force investigation after bystanders videotaped officers using an apparent chokehold to subdue a person suspected of looting after demonstrations late Sunday night.

In Atlanta, where a group of police officers on Saturday yanked two students out of a car and set upon them with a Taser, two officers were immediately fired. Criminal charges were filed this week against all six — the product, the police chief said, of “a tsunami of political jockeying.”

“We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,” said Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. “But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable.”

After a police officer in Houston on a horse ran over a woman who had her back to the officer, knocking her to the ground, the city’s mayor, Sylvester Turner, apologized to the woman. Art Acevedo, the police chief, suggested that the officer could have been distracted by protesters in the crowd throwing rocks and bottles.

Austin’s police chief, Brian Manley, also apologized after injuries to protesters in that city, including to Justin Howell, 20, who was badly hurt by a beanbag round after a person next to him hurled a water bottle at the police. 

Injuring the public “is not what we set out to do as a police department,” Chief Manley said on Monday.

Mr. Howell’s mother, Myra Howell, said on Thursday that her son, who was about to start his junior year in college, was “doing better” from his injuries, but that “it’s day by day.”

The Austin City Council on Thursday opened a two-day review of police handling of protests over the weekend, with several members expressing outrage over the police use of “less-lethal” munitions that injured four demonstrators, including Mr. Howell.

“People shouldn’t be in a hospital for attending a demonstration,” said Greg Casar, a council member, who called for a “transformational” change in policing “from top to bottom.”

Some videos have displayed a more empathetic response, like one that showed officers dancing with protesters in Lincoln, Neb.

But in many cellphone videos that have proliferated on social media, officers often appear to be unapologetic for rough treatment of demonstrators. “Don’t kill ’em, but hit ’em hard,” a state trooper in riot gear exhorts in video posted this week during protests in Seattle. 

Even medical personnel trying to provide care for protesters have reported being targeted by law enforcement. When Geoff Markowitz was working as a medic last weekend at a protest in Denver, he was surprised when rubber bullets were fired in his direction. Mr. Markowitz, a third-year medical student was tending to a protester who had been hit in the temple by a foam bullet fired by the Denver Police Department.

Mr. Markowitz estimated that he was tear-gassed more than a dozen times, even though he was only approaching if someone was seriously injured and needed to be moved.

“I believe that it is wrong to target medical professionals attempting to render aid,” he said.

The American Civil Liberties Union has responded to police tactics with lawsuits: After journalists were attacked by the police during protests in Minneapolis, the organization sued the City of Minneapolis, accusing it of abridging the constitutionally mandated freedom of the press. On Thursday, the A.C.L.U. filed a lawsuit against President Trump and Attorney General William P. Barr on behalf of Black Lives Matter D.C. and protesters who were in Lafayette Park in Washington on Monday, saying that the police firing tear gas at peaceful protesters violated their constitutional rights.

The emergence of videos from demonstrations has brought other episodes to light that might have otherwise been overlooked. In one video taken on Sunday in Chicago, police officers surrounded a car in a parking lot and forcibly pulled out people inside. The women who were in the car told Block Club Chicago they were simply trying to purchase items at a store and realized that it was closed when the police pounced.

Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who ran for office promising to reform the Police Department, said there would be an investigation.

“If any wrongdoing is discovered, officers will be held accountable,” Ms. Lightfoot said in a statement. Kim Foxx, the Cook County state’s attorney, said she would conduct an independent investigation.

Shawn Hubler reported from Sacramento, and Julie Bosman from Chicago. David Montgomery contributed reporting from Austin, Texas, and Wudan Yan from Seattle."

The images of seething unrest are stark: violent clashes between protesters and police officers clad in riot gear; police cars on fire; storefronts defaced, looted; sidewalks littered with shards of glass and the remnants of tear gas canisters and rubber bullets.

In protests against police brutality across the country, scenes of chaos and disruption have unfolded nightly for more than a week, since George Floyd, a black man, died after being handcuffed and pinned down by a white police officer in Minneapolis.

Since then, the demonstrations have spread to more than 150 American cities. There have been hundreds of arrests and several deaths. Mayors have ordered curfews in the wake of looting, National Guard troops have been summoned and the president has threatened the deployment of military police beyond Washington.

Such unrest is not new: Several years ago, crowds rallied in dozens of cities, among them Ferguson, Mo.; Baltimore; Chicago; and Madison, Wis., to protest the deaths of black men at the hands of the police.

But what is often lost in the immediate aftermath of demonstrations, some of which turned violent or destructive, is how they can bring together a community — both to repair what has been physically damaged and to continue the work that started a movement.

Last weekend, as intense demonstrations continued across much of the country, we asked a Minneapolis-based photographer to document her community’s cleanup efforts — both physically and metaphorically.

Volunteers converged on Saturday morning after four nights of chaotic protests. More than 100 businesses had been destroyed, including a bank across the street from a police precinct. They came out with brooms and other supplies and immediately got to work.

That same day, many paused for self-care and took an outdoor yoga class at the Zen Bin, a wellness center in North Minneapolis.

Hundreds showed up with bags of canned vegetables, cereals, and boxes of dry pasta for a food drive in front of the U.S. Bank on Emerson and Broadway Avenues.

Demonstrators continued to peacefully protest as cleanup efforts continued around them.

Throughout the city, memorials and messages of solidarity were created, including a colorful mural at East 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, the intersection where Mr. Floyd, 46, pleaded with an officer that he could not breathe."
Another Man Who Said ‘I Can’t Breathe’ Died in Custody. An Autopsy Calls It Homicide.,"SEATTLE — A black man who called out “I can’t breathe” before dying in police custody in Tacoma, Wash., was killed as a result of oxygen deprivation and the physical restraint that was used on him, according to details of a medical examiner’s report released on Wednesday.

The Pierce County Medical Examiner’s Office concluded that the death of the man, Manuel Ellis, 33, was a homicide. Investigators with the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department were in the process of preparing a report about the March death, which occurred shortly after an arrest by officers from the Tacoma Police Department, said the sheriff’s spokesman, Ed Troyer.

“The information is all being put together,” Detective Troyer said. “We expect to present it to the prosecutor at the end of this week or early next week.”

Mr. Ellis’s sister, Monet Carter-Mixon, called for action to bring accountability in the death and further scrutiny of both the Police Department’s practices and how the investigation into his death has been handled.

“There’s a lot of questions that still need to be answered,” Ms. Carter-Mixon said.

Mr. Ellis died from respiratory arrest, hypoxia and physical restraint, according to the medical examiner’s office. The report listed methamphetamine intoxication and heart disease as contributing factors.

Police officers encountered Mr. Ellis, a musician and father of two from Tacoma, on the night of March 3 as they were stopped at an intersection. They saw him banging on the window of another vehicle, Detective Troyer said.

Mr. Ellis approached the officers, Detective Troyer said, and then threw an officer to the ground when the officer got out of the vehicle. The two officers and two backup officers who joined — two of them white, one black and one Asian — handcuffed him.

“Mr. Ellis was physically restrained as he continued to be combative,” the Tacoma Police Department said in a statement on Wednesday.

Detective Troyer said he did not know all the details of the restraint the officers used — they were not wearing body cameras — but said he did not believe they used a chokehold or a knee on Mr. Ellis’s neck. They rolled him on his side after he called out, “I can’t breathe.”

“The main reason why he was restrained was so he wouldn’t hurt himself or them,” Detective Troyer said. “As soon as he said he couldn’t breathe, they requested medical aid.”

Detective Troyer said the call for aid came four minutes after the officers encountered Mr. Ellis.

Mr. Ellis was still breathing when medical personnel arrived, Detective Troyer said. He was removed from handcuffs while personnel worked on him for about 40 minutes, Detective Troyer said. He was then pronounced dead.

Family members said Mr. Ellis was the father of an 11-year-old son and 18-month-old daughter. He was a talented musician at his church. Ms. Carter-Mixon said Mr. Ellis was like a father figure to her boys, coaching them on things like how handle themselves to keep safe in a world of racial injustices.

“My heart literally hurts,” she said. “It’s painful. My brother was my best friend.”

On Wednesday night, she and others held a vigil in Tacoma.

Brian Giordano, a close friend of Mr. Ellis, said that the two usually spoke several times a day and that Mr. Ellis had video-chatted with him two hours before his death. He had been excited about a church service he had attended and proud of how he had played drums during the service, Mr. Giordano recalled.

He said it would be uncharacteristic of Mr. Ellis to act in the violent way described by the police.

He was living in a clean-and-sober house and was getting his life back together, he said. “He was always uplifting,” Mr. Giordano said. “He was always on the up-and-up about taking care of people.”

The death comes as protests have spread around the nation over the case of George Floyd, a black man who died in the custody of Minneapolis police last week. Minnesota officials have charged all four officers in that case, including Derek Chauvin, who kept his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes during the arrest.

Forensics experts who conducted a private autopsy for Mr. Floyd’s family concluded that another officer’s knees on Mr. Floyd’s back contributed to making it impossible for his lungs to take in sufficient air.

Mayor Victoria Woodards of Tacoma said on Wednesday that she would take appropriate steps based on the findings of the sheriff’s investigation.

“We will learn the results of that investigation even as our country reels from the recent killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and too many others,” Ms. Woodards said.

Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington said the issue was a top priority for him.

“We will be pushing to make sure there is a full and complete investigation of that incident,” Mr. Inslee said."
Witness Who Was in Floyd’s Car Says His Friend Did Not Resist Arrest,"WASHINGTON — A longtime friend of George Floyd’s who was in the passenger seat of Mr. Floyd’s car during his fatal encounter with a Minneapolis police officer said on Wednesday night that Mr. Floyd tried to defuse the tensions with the police and in no way resisted arrest.

“He was, from the beginning, trying in his humblest form to show he was not resisting in no form or way,” said the friend, Maurice Lester Hall, 42, who was tracked down on Monday in Houston, arrested on outstanding warrants and interviewed by Minnesota state investigators. 

“I could hear him pleading, ‘Please, officer, what’s all this for?’” Mr. Hall said in an interview on Wednesday night with The New York Times.

Mr. Hall recounted the last moments with Mr. Floyd on Memorial Day, May 25, after they had spent part of the day together.

“He was just crying out at that time for anyone to help because he was dying,” Mr. Hall said. “I’m going to always remember seeing the fear in Floyd’s face because he’s such a king. That’s what sticks with me, seeing a grown man cry, before seeing a grown man die.”

Mr. Hall is a key witness in the state’s investigation into the four officers who apprehended Mr. Floyd, including Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Mr. Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, even after he became unresponsive.

But Mr. Hall — who had outstanding warrants for his arrest on felony possession of a firearm, felony domestic assault and felony drug possession — provided a false name to officers at the scene of Mr. Floyd’s arrest, according to a Minnesota official.

Mr. Hall left Minneapolis and hitchhiked to Houston two days later, after visiting a memorial at the site of the police encounter.

“When the whole world was finding out that they murdered George Floyd,” he said, “I went and said a prayer where I witnessed him take his last breath, and I left.”

Mr. Hall said he had left dinner with his family late this Monday evening when their car was surrounded by at least a dozen law enforcement officers. After his arrest, he was questioned for hours by a Minnesota state investigator about Mr. Floyd’s death — not about his warrants. Mr. Hall was then transferred to the Harris County Jail in Houston, and on Tuesday, he returned to his home in the city, after his lawyers fought for his release.

“When Mr. Hall’s family found us, he had been isolated in jail for 10 hours after being interrogated until 3 a.m.,” said Ashlee C. McFarlane, a partner at Gerger Khalil Hennessy & McFarlane, who is representing Mr. Hall. “This is not how you treat a key witness, especially one that had just seen his friend murdered by police. Even with outstanding warrants, this should have been done another way.”

“I knew what was happening, that they were coming. It was inevitable,” Mr. Hall said in the interview with The Times. “I’m a key witness to the cops murdering George Floyd, and they want to know my side. Whatever I’ve been through, it’s all over with now. It’s not about me.”

Mr. Hall and Mr. Floyd, both Houston natives, had connected in Minneapolis through a pastor and had been in touch every day since 2016. Mr. Hall said that he considered Mr. Floyd a confidant and a mentor, like many in the community, and that he went back to Houston because the “only ties I had in Minnesota that had me Houston-rooted was George.”

Agents of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which is building the state’s case against Mr. Chauvin and the three other officers involved in the Floyd case, “attempted to contact Mr. Hall numerous times to no avail,” said Bruce Gordon, a spokesman for the bureau.

Mr. Hall said that he was distraught and working through his trauma with his family, and was not taking phone calls in the days immediately after.

The bureau asked law enforcement agents in Texas to arrest Mr. Hall because it believed he was not cooperating with its investigation. Mr. Hall and Ms. McFarlane, his lawyer, said that he cooperated fully with the Minnesota official’s interview.

“They got a testimony, and that’s what they were after,” Mr. Hall added. “They came and saw, and left me to fighting for my freedom.”

Passengers in the car with Mr. Floyd, a man and a woman, had remained unidentified until Mr. Hall spoke with The Times on Wednesday. Mr. Hall said that he did not know the woman’s name.

Minnesota officials said on Wednesday that the state had upgraded the charges against Mr. Chauvin to second-degree murder from third-degree murder and manslaughter. They also charged the other three officers who took part in the fatal arrest — Thomas Lane, 37, J. Alexander Kueng, 26, and Tou Thao, 34 — with aiding and abetting murder.

All four officers were fired the day after Mr. Floyd died and video of his death went viral online.

“I walk with Floyd,” Mr. Hall said. “I know that I’m going to be his voice.”"
"Today’s Activism: Spontaneous, Leaderless, but Not Without Aim","MINNEAPOLIS — In the sea of hundreds of protesters who gathered one evening this week near the intersection where George Floyd was killed, a lone voice rose from the crowd.

“Everybody sit down,” it urgently ordered.

Others chimed in — “Sit down! Sit down!” — scolding those, even journalists, who were slow to comply.

A few minutes later, Tony Clark, wearing a black face mask and an earring with the inscription “Not today Satan,” bounded toward the center of the circle of seated bodies and took the megaphone.

“Everybody stand up,” he commanded, contradicting the earlier speaker’s instructions.

The crowd rose.

“The moment y’all sit down, the moment they’re going to step on y’all,” Mr. Clark, 27, said to rousing applause. But a half-hour later, he reversed his stance and told everyone to sit down again.

“Stop barking orders,” said Davi Young, a Marine veteran, twisting his face. “You’re not the police.”

Welcome to 21st-century activism, where spontaneous and leaderless movements have been defined by their organic births and guided on the fly by people whose preferences, motivations and ideas may not always align.

But the absence of organized leadership does not mean the movements — from the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street to Black Lives Matter — are rudderless.

Leveraging technology that was unavailable to earlier generations, the activists of today have a digital playbook. Often, it begins with an injustice captured on video and posted to social media. Demonstrations are hastily arranged, hashtags are created and before long, thousands have joined the cause.

At the core is an egalitarian spirit, a belief that everyone has a voice, and that everyone’s voice matters.

“This is much more than an organization. This is much more than an individual,” said Nejah Ibrahim, 26, sitting on the pavement at the intersection where Mr. Floyd was arrested, sporadically leading chants or delivering messages from a megaphone.

“This is collective people who came together,” he continued, “to stand against a systematic oppression that we have endured for so long.”

But leaderless movements have their challenges.

It can be difficult to keep protests from spilling out of control, and difficult to maintain a clear and focused message. Disputes over the best strategies can easily emerge.

“I think it is detrimental that we lack that kind of structure, organization,” said Dame Jasmine Hughes, 33, standing at a makeshift memorial for Mr. Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis police officer pinned Mr. Floyd’s neck to the ground with his left knee for nearly nine minutes.

The officer, Derek Chauvin, was fired from the Minneapolis Police Department and charged with second-degree murder. Three other officers at the scene were charged on Wednesday with aiding and abetting the killing.

“Organizations show power,” Ms. Hughes continued. “There’s power in clarity. There’s power in structure, especially when people are hurting.”

Though organized structure might be loose, traditional civil rights groups, churches and newly minted activist organizations have provided guidance and tactical and practical support to activists around the country.

Carmen Means, a pastor who has led a mostly online congregation since 2015 and is the director of the Central Area Neighborhood Development Organization in Minneapolis, said her congregants helped set up a memorial for Mr. Floyd. They have received food donations and they turned a nearby building into a food bank, where there was recently a long line of residents.

And she has led discussions outside Cup Foods — the corner store near where the fatal encounter between Mr. Floyd and the police took place — where people talked about how Mr. Floyd’s death has affected them.

“They were weeping,” she said. “You could see the trauma that was in their eyes.”

More than emotional support, Pastor Means and her fellow activists also try to help strategize the demonstrators’ next moves.

She said she has convened daily meetings for “strategic thinking, planning because we understand that this is not a sprint. This is a marathon, right?”

Part of that strategy is figuring out how to channel the energy of young activists who are not affiliated with official organizations. They may have raw rage, she said, and need guidance in finding productive ways to express it.

“We do tell them that it is their right to protest and be angry. That’s something courageous,” said Shanene Herbert, a member of Pastor Means’s congregation who helps youth in the community.

“But we want them to understand what their rights are,” added Keeya Allen, another congregant. “Understand that they have a life to live. So it’s not about, are you going to die for the cause? Or are you going to live for the cause every day?”

These days, social media is the strongest, most prominent leader. Young activists announce the location of an action or protest on Twitter or Instagram, and within an hour, scores of people are there.

“I think it kind of does make it hard to manage because you don’t know who’s coming,” said Maryan Farasle, a 17-year-old high school senior who lives in the Minneapolis suburbs and is an activist organizer. “You don’t know the people showing up and what their intentions are.”

But at the same time, she added, “I think it is a way to get a lot of people together quickly.”

The young generation of activists also uses social media to police one another and help keep everyone safe. On Thursday night, after protesters set fire to the Third Police Precinct headquarters in Minneapolis, one Twitter user warned people to leave the area.

Tensions on the streets in Minneapolis and elsewhere have simmered in recent days, amid a tough law enforcement crackdown and passionate pleas from Mr. Floyd’s family to keep the peace.

But today’s young activists also avoid singular leaders. “We’ve seen what happens to people in the past when they’re the lead of anything,” Ms. Farasle said, referring to civil rights leaders who have been slain.

Tay Anderson, a 21-year-old organizer in Denver, has found himself facing that danger — and walking a tightrope.

As the protests in Denver tipped into violence and vandalism, he spoke out against looting and rioting while police officers shot projectiles and launched tear gas at the crowd. He once helped negotiate a stand-down with officers to defuse tensions, and some activists accused him of working with the police, he said.

After days of speaking through a megaphone to sign-waving crowds about police killings and systemic racism, Mr. Anderson said that chilling online messages forced him to pull back from the crowds on Monday.

He was doing online searches of his name to fact-check news articles that quoted him when Google’s “related searches” showed a disturbing list: “Tay Anderson shot.” “Tay Anderson shot in head.” “Tay Anderson shot in back of head.”

“They can try to silence me but I’m not going to let anybody put a muzzle on me,” he said.

Despite the dangers, some lean into the prospect of being a leader.

“I am a leader,” Mr. Clark said this week as he stood among scores of people at the vigil site for Mr. Floyd on Minneapolis’s South Side.

Moments later, commotion broke out on the edges of the gathering, an apparent dispute between some of the protesters. Some began to scatter.

“Why are we running?” a man with dreadlocks shouted. “Stand your ground,” a woman with a white cap yelled. Others exhorted: “Stay here! Stay here!”

Things eventually calmed down, until police lights appeared in the distance and protesters rushed toward a makeshift wooden fence they had erected as a barrier to protect their vigil site. “Be peaceful!” protesters shouted. “Don’t instigate!”

Mr. Clark sprang into action and urged everyone to stay disciplined.

It turned out to be a false alarm. The police turned around, but Mr. Clark worked his way back to the center of the crowd and spoke into the megaphone like a general readying his troops for battle.

Is anyone going home tonight, he asked.

“No!”

And when the tear gas and rubber bullets come, he said, they would need to stand pat.

“Our ancestors have been through worse,” said Mr. Clark, a barber who is struggling to find work because of the coronavirus pandemic. “We’re going to beat this by being in peace tonight.”

Historic Wins for Women of Color as Nation Protests Systemic Racism,"WASHINGTON — As the nation remained gripped by widespread protests against police brutality and systemic racism, black and Hispanic women won elections in multiple states on Tuesday while Representative Steve King, a nine-term congressman with a long history of racist remarks, was ousted in a Republican primary in Iowa.

And as the coronavirus pandemic upended the election process, with millions of absentee ballots flooding clerks offices and consolidated polling locations leading to hourslong waits in cities across the country, a determined electorate pushed turnout past 2016 levels in nearly all of the eight states that held primary contests.

In Philadelphia, voters strode past National Guard troops deployed amid the protests to drop off their absentee ballots. In Washington, D.C., voters observing social-distancing measures waited in line for close to five hours, some not returning home until after midnight, long after the curfew that had been set by the city.

The result was a dramatic night for candidates of color up and down the ballot, largely in Democratic primaries for Congress, state legislatures and city halls, at a time when national leaders like former President Barack Obama are encouraging a nation reeling from the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and other black Americans to embrace civic action and vote.

In New Mexico, 17 women won Democratic primaries for the state legislature. In Iowa, 11 women won primaries for the statehouse. In Monroe County, Pa., Claudette Williams, the first black woman to serve as county chair, won her primary to represent a competitive state House district, a seat that state Democrats are hoping to flip. And in Washington, D.C., Janeese Lewis George, a self-described democratic socialist, beat a sitting city councilman whose mailers said Ms. George wanted “to cut police in Ward 4.” She prevailed by 10 percentage points.

The city of Ferguson, Mo., elected its first African-American mayor, six years after protests against the police killing there of Michael Brown, a black teenager, propelled the Black Lives Matter movement to national prominence.

The mayor-elect, Ella Jones, a city councilwoman, said she had received hundreds of messages from throughout the country, including from congressional leaders, senators and Democratic Party officials.

Her favorite, though, was a tweet from Mr. Obama, who called her victory “a reminder of the difference politics and voting can make in changing who has the power to make real change.”

“My election gives people hope,” Ms. Jones said in an interview. “Everybody is looking for a change, everybody wants to have a better way of life. You don’t want to go four blocks and worry about getting shot. Nobody wants that. It is starting to get better. We are making changes.”

“I have been living in injustice all my life,” she said. “I didn’t just get exposed to it because I became a City Council member.”

Ms. Jones’s victory represented “poetic justice,” said LaTosha Brown, the co-founder of Black Voters Matter, a nonprofit group that works to increase voter engagement.

“Ferguson set off new energy in this country,” Ms. Brown said. “This is a political turning point. The country is being activated in light of this violence.”

For too long, she said, political power had been concentrated among white men. “We are the face of the future of America,” she added.

Many of the candidates of color who won on Tuesday, most of whom are Democrats, still face difficult battles in November. And Republican women won in five House districts expected to be competitive this November, a significant shift as the party has tried to recruit more women in recent years.

Progressive activists hailed Tuesday’s primary results as evidence that the widespread protests can spur political action, leading to important gains in electing more candidates who focus heavily on issues of race and inequality.

Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, a progressive group focused on black voters, said her polling has found that each political crisis brings a growing intensity among black voters to vote, in whichever election is on the ballot, to reject whichever candidate or policy is more closely associated with President Trump.

“People believe that every vote they cast is a message being sent to Donald Trump, no matter what they’re voting for,” Ms. Shropshire said.

Mayra Macías, the executive director of the Latino Victory Project, which endorsed several candidates who won on Tuesday, said the protests of the last 10 days illustrated the need for more diverse elected officials.

“We are winning with people we need, who can represent the communities that are suffering,” she said.

Democrats see the wins as a prelude to November, when they hope to recapture the White House in part by relying on voters who are enraged by Mr. Trump’s rhetoric and actions.

“The attacks that the president has been consistent about making are against people of color, immigrants and especially women,” said Representative Tony Cárdenas, Democrat of California and the chairman of BOLD Pac, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus’s political action committee. “I think that a lot of women are stepping up and saying, ‘I just can’t leave it to people like him, I need to do my part.’”

States that aggressively promoted mail voting saw large increases in turnout compared with their 2016 primaries — even though four years ago there were competitive presidential races in both parties and Tuesday’s contest featured only a long-decided Democratic race.

Iowa, which mailed absentee ballot request forms to every registered voter, had the largest turnout for a June primary in the state’s history, according to Paul Pate, the secretary of state. In Montana, which mailed ballots to all registered voters, total turnout was up 35 percent compared with the state’s 2016 primary. Turnout was up 14 percent in New Mexico and 12 percent in South Dakota, despite few competitive races there.

The primary results in New Mexico reflected a significant shift. In the Democratic contest for a House seat representing the northern part of the state, Teresa Leger Fernandez, a progressive with deep roots in New Mexico, easily defeated Valerie Plame, the former C.I.A. agent.

Ms. Leger Fernandez is widely expected to prevail in November in her staunchly Democratic district. Her victory would mean New Mexico could have a House delegation that entirely comprises Hispanic and Native American women.

Representative Deb Haaland, a Native American elected to Congress in 2018 to represent the district encompassing Albuquerque, is expected to hold her seat.

And in the southern part of the state, Representative Xochitl Torres Small, a Hispanic first-term Democrat, is running for re-election against Yvette Herrell, who won the Republican primary. Ms. Herrell is an enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation.

The congressional delegation will represent a state where Anglos are in the minority, accounting for 37 percent of the population. Hispanics make up 49 percent of New Mexico’s population while Native Americans account for about 11 percent.

Throughout her campaign, Ms. Leger Fernandez emphasized her family’s long history in the state — her parents helped institute the state’s early bilingual education programs, which she views as a key element of the state’s multicultural identity.

And she drew on her father’s experience as a rancher bringing meat to restaurants with signs on the door that read “No dogs or Mexicans.”

“We bring these voices, we know what it is like to be from a community that has suffered,” Ms. Leger Fernandez said.

While law enforcement in New Mexico is not involved in as much race-based conflict as elsewhere, partly because the police force reflects the demographics of the population, there are other examples of entrenched inequality in the state, Ms. Leger Fernandez said.

“We have the disproportionate impact from Covid-19 and we have failed to invest our communities of color, in our working-class communities,” she said. “Those are groups that are suffering more, but I think what we have at this moment is a coalition that is willing to call it by its name — systemic racism — and a desire to address it.”

In a race certain to be competitive in November, Christina Hale, a Cuban-American state legislator who won a Democratic congressional primary in Indiana on Tuesday, will face Victoria Spartz, a Ukrainian-born Republican state senator who self-funded her primary campaign and overcame 14 primary opponents.

They are seeking to represent the state’s Fifth Congressional District, which covers suburbs north of Indianapolis and several rural counties. Ms. Hale would be the first Latina congresswoman from Indiana.

Ms. Hale, whose suburban and rural district is just 9 percent black and 5 percent Hispanic, said the Trump era, along with the events of recent weeks, had spurred more women to become involved in politics.

“We’ve had traditionally low voter turnout in Indiana,” Ms. Hale said in an interview. People around her were starting to take their role in the democratic process more seriously, she said, “turning out to vote, and stepping up to be candidates themselves.”

In Idaho, Paulette Jordan, a Native American former state representative who previously ran for governor, won a Democratic Senate primary. Though she faces an uphill battle to defeat Senator Jim Risch in her heavily Republican state, Ms. Jordan’s candidacy gives Idaho, with its large Native American population, the chance to elect the first Native American to statewide office since Larry Echo Hawk was elected attorney general in 1990.

In Ferguson, Ms. Jones said she hoped other women of color would see her win as a reason to be persistent — she lost her first bid for mayor in 2017.

As she waited for the election results on Tuesday night, she sat on a bench outside the Ferguson Community Empowerment Center, surrounded by a few supporters wearing face masks.

The site used to be home to a QuikTrip convenience store that was burned down during the 2014 protests. The bench is dedicated to Michael Brown.

Photos and Videos From the California Protests,"Protests have erupted in at least 140 cities across the United States in the days after George Floyd, a black man, died in police custody in Minneapolis.

Some of the protests turned violent, prompting the activation of the National Guard in at least 21 states, including California, where troops were concentrated in the southern region.

On Monday, Gov. Gavin Newsom spoke forcefully about recognizing the outrage, fear and hurt among black Americans who he said have been promised change too many times without results, long before the killing of Mr. Floyd.

“The black community is not responsible for what’s happening in this country — we are,” the governor said. “People have lost patience for a reason.”

As protests swelled throughout the state, several cities and counties began imposing curfews over the weekend and early into the week, including all of Los Angeles and Alameda Counties.

Thousands of demonstrators marched along Third Street in west Los Angeles on Saturday.

Protesters chanted and raised their hands at the corner of Ocean Avenue and Colorado Avenue in Santa Monica on Sunday.

Demonstrators gathered in front of the San Diego Police Department in downtown San Diego on Sunday.

A peaceful protest of thousands marched along the theater district of Hollywood Boulevard on Monday.

Huntington Beach SWAT team members stood ready for protesters on Sunday.

Demonstrators knelt during a protest in Anaheim on Monday.

Thousands of protesters gathered in Oakland before an 8 p.m. curfew on Monday.

Pope Francis Calls Unrest in U.S. ‘Disturbing’,"ROME — Pope Francis said on Wednesday that he was watching the “disturbing social unrest” in the United States with “great concern,” adding his voice to those of other world leaders who have spoken up about the days of unrest across the United States after the death of a black man in Minneapolis.

“We cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life,” the pope said in his weekly general audience.

He said he was praying for “the repose of the soul of George Floyd and of all those others who have lost their lives as a result of the sin of racism.”

The pope was the latest religious or government leader to react to the turmoil in the United States, where, for more than a week, tens of thousands of people have staged daily peaceful protests and impassioned marches across the country. The looting that has followed demonstrations in recent days has somewhat tapered off.

The protests erupted after Mr. Floyd, a 46-year-old black security guard, died after his neck was pinned under a white police officer’s knee for nearly nine minutes in Minneapolis last week. The officer has been fired and charged with second-degree murder, and three other officers were charged with aiding and abetting murder. The killing, captured on video, was the spark for the outpouring of anger and anguish expressed in demonstrations in more than 140 cities. 

The pope’s comments came a day after Christian leaders criticized President Trump for using two religious sites in Washington for what they said were acts of political theater. On Monday, Mr. Trump posed holding a Bible outside the historic St. John’s Episcopal Church, and on Tuesday he and the first lady spent about 10 minutes inside the St. John Paul II National Shrine.

The pope called for “national reconciliation and peace” and said the recent violence on U.S. streets was “self-destructive and self-defeating.” Like his predecessors, Pope Francis has often used his weekly addresses to the faithful — a general audience each Wednesday and a prayer on Sundays — to weigh in on global matters and issues of social justice. He has tackled subjects like human trafficking and migration, climate change and its impact on the poor, and access to universal health care, which have been among the cornerstones of his papacy.

The pope’s condemnation of racism and calls for justice in the aftermath of Mr. Floyd’s death echoed comments from other current and former leaders.

Mr. Carter on Wednesday issued a statement in support of the protests but condemning the violence.

“Rosalynn and I are pained by the tragic racial injustices and consequent backlash across our nation in recent weeks,” he said. “Our hearts are with the victims’ families and all who feel hopeless in the face of pervasive racial discrimination and outright cruelty. We all must shine a spotlight on the immorality of racial discrimination. But violence, whether spontaneous or consciously incited, is not a solution.

“As a white male of the South, I know all too well the impact of segregation and injustice to African Americans. As a politician, I felt a responsibility to bring equity to my state and our country.”

“We need a government as good as its people, he said, “and we are better than this.”

On Tuesday, Mr. Bush praised peaceful protesters and called for empathy for people seeking justice.

“Laura and I are anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country,” he said in a statement. “It remains a shocking failure that many African Americans, especially young African-American men, are harassed and threatened in their own country.”

He said the “doctrine and habits of racial superiority, which once nearly split our country, still threaten our union.”

Mr. Obama has released two statements about the death of Mr. Floyd and in an online town hall on Wednesday praised the protesters and called for police reform. 

“It’s natural to wish for life ‘to just get back to normal’ as a pandemic and economic crisis upend everything around us,” he said on Friday. “But we have to remember that for millions of Americans, being treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly ‘normal’ — whether it’s while dealing with the health care system, or interacting with the criminal justice system, or jogging down the street, or just watching birds in a park.”

Mr. Obama commented again on Monday, in an essay published on Medium, after the weekend’s protests expanded and turned violent in some cases.

“Let’s not excuse violence, or rationalize it, or participate in it,” he said. “If we want our criminal justice system, and American society at large, to operate on a higher ethical code, then we have to model that code ourselves.”



When asked on Tuesday what he thought of Mr. Trump’s call for military action against American protesters and the tear-gassing of peaceful demonstrators to make way for a photo-op, Mr. Trudeau paused at his lectern for 21 uncomfortable, televised seconds.

transcript

Reporter: “You’ve been reluctant to comment on the words and actions of the U.S. president. But we do have Donald Trump now calling for military action against protesters. We saw protesters tear-gassed yesterday to make way for a presidential photo-op. I’d like to ask you what you think about that. And if you don’t want to comment, what message do you think you’re sending?” “We all watch in horror and consternation, what’s going on in the United States. It is a time to pull people together. But it is a time to listen, is a time to learn what injustices continue despite progress over years and decades. But it is a time for us as Canadians to recognize that we too have our challenges, that black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day. There is systemic discrimination in Canada, which means our systems treat Canadians of color, Canadians who are racialized, differently than they do others.”

Finally, he said: “We all watch in horror and consternation what’s going on in the United States.” He then spoke out about racism against black Canadians and other people of color.

“It is a time for us as Canadians to recognize that we too have our challenges,” he said, adding, “There is systemic racism in Canada.”

On May 30, Mr. Clinton said in a statement that Mr. Floyd’s death was “the latest in a long line of tragedy and injustice, and a painful reminder that a person’s race still determines how they will be treated in nearly every aspect of American life.”

“No one deserves to die the way George Floyd did. And the truth is, if you’re white in America, the chances are you won’t,” Mr. Clinton said.

March Peacefully or ‘Take the Streets’? Protesters Debate What Comes Next,"MINNEAPOLIS — The unrest in America’s cities showed no signs of fading on Tuesday as embattled police forces from Atlanta to Los Angeles struggled to reclaim the streets and as protesters debated the future of the week-old uprising.

Police and National Guard troops continued a heavy lockdown in Minneapolis, where the death in police custody of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, ignited the first protests. Gov. Tim Walz announced civil rights charges against the Minneapolis Police Department and said his administration would investigate whether there had been systemic discrimination against people of color over the past 10 years.

An estimated 10,000 people gathered peacefully outside the State Capitol as a Black Hawk helicopter flew behind the freshly gilded dome. National Guard troops applauded, handed out water and sometimes dropped to their knees in a show of support for the protesters.

American troops positioned military vehicles across Washington, and a crowd of protesters at least twice the size of the day before gathered near the White House. It shrank after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew, but more than 1,000 protesters remained, facing police officers across a tall chain-link fence erected overnight.

Thousands more gathered in the heart of Hollywood on Tuesday evening as police officers filed out of trucks and formed a skirmish line.

Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York extended the city’s 8 p.m. curfew — which some groups of protesters again ignored a day after looting in Midtown — through Sunday. He also promised to take action against the “outsiders,” “gang members” and “common criminals” he said were responsible for looting and violence.

“I know we will overcome this. I want to be abundantly clear,” the mayor said, warning: “We will have a tough few days.”

In more than a week of protests, the violence has continued to escalate, and both the police and protesters have been victims.

Officers in New York City and Buffalo were plowed over by cars and injured. After protests in the St. Louis area turned violent, four police officers were shot and a 77-year-old retired police captain was shot and killed by looters at a pawnshop.

And in Las Vegas, a police officer was in critical condition on Tuesday after being shot as the authorities tried to disperse crowds pelting them with bottles and rocks.

But protesters, too, have been caught in the increasingly forceful law enforcement crackdowns. In Atlanta, six police officers were charged with using excessive force after video footage showed them stopping two college students in a car Saturday night, firing Tasers at them and dragging them out of their vehicle.

“The conduct involved in this incident is not indicative of the way that we treat people in the City of Atlanta,” Paul L. Howard, Jr., the district attorney, said in a news conference on Tuesday.

President Trump has pushed on states to crack down even harder on the protests, leaving demonstrators debating how to respond to a growing police and military presence in the streets.

As the demographics of the movement have expanded to include a far more diverse population, the goals have also broadened.

Some demonstrators are demanding that all four officers involved in Mr. Floyd’s death be thrown in jail, not just the single officer charged last week. “All four,” they shouted at protests. Many others are calling for the entire system of inequality that they view as the ultimate cause of Mr. Floyd’s death to be torn down and rebuilt.

Outside the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, a racially diverse crowd of hundreds has gathered nightly, with people chanting against institutions they feel contribute to racial and socioeconomic divides — including law enforcement and capitalism. Those carrying signs cursing Amazon and Jeff Bezos have stood alongside others demanding an end to police brutality.

“What feels different about right now is people are angry for themselves in a way that we did not see outside of black people four years ago,” said Sharhonda Bossier, who began participating in protests affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement in 2013.

In some cities, protesters worried that violence could overshadow their message and have engaged in self-policing to prevent emotions from escalating.

On Monday afternoon, Mr. Floyd’s brother Terrence visited the spot where his brother was killed, near an intersection that has turned into a peaceful gathering spot for protesters. One of the first things Terrence Floyd did was criticize the looting, window-smashing and arson that has accompanied some of the protests.

“If I’m not over here blowing up stuff, if I’m not over here messing up my community, then what are you all doing?” he asked, his voice growing louder. “What are you all doing? You all doing nothing! Because that’s not going to bring my brother back at all.”

Instead, Mr. Floyd, who came to Minneapolis from Brooklyn, urged people to research political candidates and vote for change.

Some particularly uncomfortable conflicts between white and black protesters have reflected the very divide that protesters are hoping to upend.

In Baltimore on Saturday night, Denicia Baker was chanting, “Hands up, don’t shoot!” outside City Hall with a group of about 200 protesters when two young white men wearing black T-shirts and ski masks started kicking and shaking protective fencing put up by the police.

“Stop!” Ms. Baker yelled at the men, recording the episode on her cellphone. “When you do that, they don’t go after you. They come after us.”

During a heated exchange, one of the young men responded: “They’re going to kill you anyway.”

Eventually, other protesters removed the two white men. Ms. Baker said she suspected they only wanted to stir up trouble.

In many of the demonstrations, white protesters say they have tried to hang back and listen or play a supporting role by passing out water, hand sanitizer and snacks. Some have gone as far as to use their bodies to shield black protesters as the police are bearing down on them.

But some escalations led by white protesters have not been welcome.

“If you show up in these spaces across the country, you are a guest,” said Takirra Winfield Dixon, a former Obama administration official and activist based in Baltimore. “You don’t necessarily have the right to pick up a brick and throw it through a window.”

In some cases, conflicts have erupted between local protesters and others who have come in from outside.

In Minneapolis, Michael “Big Texas” Holiday, a community activist from Houston as large as his name, whipped up a crowd on Sunday, telling hundreds of gathered protesters that they needed to stop giving lip service and take action.

When the officers use kicks, chokeholds, punches, takedowns, Mace spray, Tasers and the like, the person subject to that force is black about 60 percent of the time.

“You fired up?” he yelled into a megaphone. People cheered, raising their fists into the air. “Let’s take the streets!”

But then, a local man came forward with a quiet warning. “I’m telling you right now: If you march, they will come full force at you,” he said — people would get hurt.

Mr. Holiday reconsidered. “Word has just got to me that this might not be the safest thing,” he announced.

Across the country, opposing approaches have often been on display simultaneously in the same city.

On Monday night in Los Angeles, peaceful demonstrators in West Hollywood knelt alongside a police officer in a show of mutual good will. But in Van Nuys, a few miles north, a protest splintered. Looters broke into a pharmacy and a Big 5 Sporting Goods store; police chased them on foot.

A number of people peeled off from a peaceful gathering in Hollywood and headed for the Gower Gulch shopping complex, smashing windows of the Kebab Daddy restaurant and ripping plywood off a T-Mobile store and a Rite Aid. Most of the mob fled when officers showed up.

In Washington, D.C., protesters squabbled on Monday over how to respond as law enforcement wielding pepper spray advanced upon them. Some shouted through the cloud of chemicals that the group should stand strong; others pleaded to fall back for safety.

Later in the night, tensions rose again after Army helicopters descended to rooftop level, kicking up dirt and debris and snapping tree branches in a maneuver often used in combat zones to scare away insurgents.

Some young people wearing masks responded by throwing rocks at storefronts, while others appeared intent on continuing to march peacefully.

In some cases, the debate among protesters over how to respond to the police breaks down along generational lines. Just before midnight on Sunday, rumors swirled that the authorities were about to break up protesters near the intersection where Mr. Floyd died. A black woman and two white men, all in their 20s, hatched a plan to set fire to a barrier of garbage containers and wooden palettes to prevent the police from moving in.

“Hey, do you have flammables in the car?” the woman asked the men.

They ran off, returning with plastic bottles filled with liquid, which they poured over the wood and containers. At that point, a group of people hurried over, telling them to stop. One of them was the woman’s father.

“What you’re doing — they understand that violence,” he said angrily. “There ain’t a vehicle that they have that can’t run through fire.”

The woman looked down. “You’re my daughter. I got you,” he said, and she walked away.

Johnetta Elzie, an early participant in the Black Lives Matter movement who co-founded the group Campaign Zero, which advocates against police violence, said she had seen the full spectrum of emotional responses that could bubble up in a protest in recent days, often based on each person’s individual life experience

She said divisions were inherent to protest and should not be seen as necessarily detrimental to the cause. “Who am I to stop them?”

Joe Biden Listens to Anguish at a Black Church in Delaware,"As the nation entered another day of unrest in response to the killing of George Floyd, who was pinned under a police officer’s knee for nearly nine minutes, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. emerged from isolation to meet with community leaders at a black church in Delaware.

The event Monday morning, at Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, was part listening session, part campaign speech and part forum for members of Wilmington’s black community to express their collective anguish.

“Anger just doesn’t come out of nowhere,” Eugene Young, president of the Metropolitan Wilmington Urban League, said of the protests against police brutality that have gripped cities across the country. “This anger comes from the fact that you have people in our community that feel as though the knee has been on their back for a long time.”

Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester, Democrat of Delaware, had to pause to collect herself while recalling an exchange the night before with a 23-year-old protester in Wilmington.

“He used the term ‘I’m standing my ground,’ which broke my heart, and then he said, ‘I’m willing to die,’” Ms. Blunt Rochester said, her voice rising. “And he said, ‘I have so much rage.’ And I said: ‘How old are you? What’s your name? How old are you?’ And I just tried to hold him! Covid or not!”

For around an hour, Mr. Biden sat silently at the front of the church, a surgical mask covering his face, taking notes as speaker after speaker expressed versions of the same message: We support you, but you need to do more.

“Over the eight years you were vice president, there were lots of successes, but the African-American community did not experience the same economic opportunity and upward mobility that they did in the ’90s,” State Senator Darius Brown said, adding, “We’re here not only to love you but to push you.”

If there was one contrast between the people in the streets and the people in the church on Monday, it was age: The protesters are largely young. The people speaking to Mr. Biden were mostly middle-aged or older — and they challenged Mr. Biden to address the disparity.

“What I worry about for our young people is feelings of hopelessness and frustration if they don’t feel that they have a hope for their future,” said Devona Williams, chairwoman of the board of trustees at Delaware State University, which is historically black.

“Education doesn’t mean anything if we can’t go birdwatching, if we can’t jog and if we can’t go to a convenience store,” Dr. Williams said. “And if we can’t do the normal things, the normal daily living things, it creates a feeling of oppression and frustration, and all the things that are the tricks of the enemy to get us angry and then cause us to be violent.”

The Rev. Shanika Perry, the church’s youth pastor, asked Mr. Biden to meet with young black people.

“They want to be at the table,” she said. “It is not enough to have the youth pastor speaking on their behalf. They have brilliant ideas themselves.”

Black women want a seat at the table, too, Ms. Perry said, urging Mr. Biden to choose one as his running mate. Black women are the most reliable voting bloc within the Democratic Party, she noted, adding, “but when it matters, you guys don’t necessarily include us when it comes to positions of power.”

When Mr. Biden finally stood up to speak, he quoted the philosopher Soren Kierkegaard — “‘Faith sees best in the dark,’” he said, “and it’s been pretty dark” — before condemning President Trump for, he said, publicly legitimizing the racism that protesters are fighting against.

Earlier in his career, “I thought we could actually defeat hate,” Mr. Biden said. “What I realized — not just white supremacy, but hate — hate just hides. Hate just hides. It doesn’t go away. And when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen to the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks.”

Mr. Biden added that he did not take black voters for granted and that he was putting together a detailed set of policy proposals to address their concerns. He also said he believed the events of the past few months would force more Americans to confront institutionalized racism. 

It is not just police violence but also the coronavirus pandemic, which has been disproportionately affecting black communities. It is not just Mr. Floyd but also Breonna Taylor, whom the police in Louisville, Ky., killed in her own apartment; Ahmaud Arbery, who was killed by two white men while jogging in Georgia; and Christian Cooper, who asked a white woman in Central Park to leash her dog, only for the woman to call the police and claim he was threatening her life.

“Ordinary folks who don’t think of themselves as having a prejudiced bone in their body, don’t think of themselves as racist, have kind of had the mask pulled off,” Mr. Biden said.

As Mr. Floyd’s death and the resulting unrest convulsed the country last week, Mr. Biden gave the sort of address to a nation in crisis that Americans normally would expect to hear from the Oval Office. In the Friday speech, he sought to paint a contrast with the president, who was mostly stoking the flames, calling protesters “thugs” and suggesting that they could be shot.

The moment fits neatly with one of the biggest messages Mr. Biden’s campaign has sought to convey all year: that he can provide steady leadership instead of chaos. But, occurring as it has during a pandemic that has shut down in-person campaign events, it is a uniquely difficult moment to seize.

In Friday’s speech, which he delivered virtually, Mr. Biden urged Americans to grapple with the fact that the country’s long history of racism was not history at all, but a “deep, open wound.”

“The pain is too immense for one community to bear alone,” he said. “I believe it’s the duty of every American to grapple with it, and to grapple with it now. With our complacency, our silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence.”

Mr. Biden did not criticize the protesters’ tactics in those remarks, but he did in a statement later that night, somewhat shifting the unapologetic tone of his initial speech. Two days later, after a night of unrest in Wilmington, Mr. Biden visited the site of the protests and toured damaged businesses with Ms. Blunt Rochester, who is a national co-chairwoman of his campaign.

Former President Barack Obama, who has endorsed Mr. Biden, expressed support for peaceful protesters in a Medium post on Monday, and urged those protesters to vote — not only in the presidential race, but also in state and local races. He expressed hope that the current anger could lead to substantive change in a way that past protests over police killings and systemic racism did not.

It was that hope that the leaders who addressed Mr. Biden were loudly searching for.

“Right before this all happened, somebody gave me a gift,” Ms. Blunt Rochester said, a bright red face mask pulled down around her chin, her arm raised to display the bracelet she was wearing.

“It says ‘breathe.’ Breathe. Because many times we come in rooms where we just can’t breathe, and then to see George Floyd — he is a representation that people feel our breath has been taken away. And we’ve got to get it back.”

‘He Could Have Been My Brother’: Women’s Voices in the Protests,"— Sade Roberts, 27, handing out pizza at a protest near the Barclays Center in Brooklyn

In Her Words is available as a newsletter. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox.

For days now, New York, like so many cities across the country, has erupted in protest. Thousands circled the Barclays Center in Brooklyn chanting, “I can’t breathe.” Hundreds knelt outside police precincts, urging officers to “take a knee” in solidarity. They shut down traffic on the Manhattan Bridge. Others smashed shop windows in SoHo and Midtown Manhattan, the commercial heart of the city.

The protests against police brutality, fueled by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week, have roiled a city and a nation already aching from the double trauma of pandemic and economic crisis.

Some of the scenes from New York’s days of protest were chaotic — cars ablaze, trash flying through the air. Others were peaceful: Protesters handed one another bandages and masks, and wept as they shouted the names of black women and men killed by the police.

The crowds across New York were strikingly young, many in their teens and 20s. Some young black women carried signs memorializing lives taken by police violence: “He’s my dad, brother, uncle, cousin,” one sign read. “His life matters.”

A city that lay quiet for two months is now pulsing. Who are the people filling the streets?

Tehilah LeBlanc, Barclays Center, Brooklyn

On Friday night Tehilah LeBlanc, 17, walked with her boyfriend down Atlantic Avenue in a sea of protesters. The two chanted: “No justice, no peace!” As they passed a line of police, LeBlanc felt a wave of fear: “One cop put his hand on his side with his gun,” she said. “My heart starts pounding.”

LeBlanc decided to join the protests because she wanted to channel her emotions into action. She pushed herself to watch the video of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis last week. “People said that it’s too gruesome for someone my age to watch,” she said. “But I felt like I had to see it. And my heart started getting heavy.”

She carried that grief with her as she shouted George Floyd’s name with people marching past the Barclays Center. “I get more angry every time I shout their names,” LeBlanc said. “He could have been my brother, or father. He was somebody’s father and son and brother.”

As the night wore on, LeBlanc saw conditions get “more chaotic.” She watched people throwing garbage in the street, and saw a car engulfed in flames. But she also witnessed moments of unity, as protesters stepped up to protect one another.

LeBlanc was walking past the 79th police precinct, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, when she saw a police car driving forward toward a group of protesters. “A bunch of women stood up and formed a line in front of the car,” she said. “I saw Italians, black women, white women. It made me feel like I could do anything and what I say matters, because I have people behind me. I felt empowered.”

Asked what inspired him to come out to protest, her boyfriend, Xavier Bell, pointed at LeBlanc: “She inspired me.”

Ronni H., Williamsburg, Brooklyn

On Sunday afternoon in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Ronni H., 21, urged the dozens of people sunbathing and picnicking in McCarren Park to join the protest. “The ability to choose to stand by and applaud is performative and doesn’t do anything for the movement,” she said.

Seeing people sitting and watching the protesters without joining in was especially frustrating in a “gentrified neighborhood,” she added. “Many white people transplanted to Williamsburg and disrupted the lives of black people living here.”

She ran past the park calling: “Join us! March with us!”

One woman enjoying the sunshine in the park decided to get up and march. “There’s no way I could see this and not join in,” said Jackie Rodriguez, 56.

*Ronni prefers not to use her full name because of safety concerns.

Sade Roberts, Barclays Center, Brooklyn

Sade Roberts, 27, was supposed to go biking with a friend Sunday, but he had a different suggestion: Hand out pizza to protesters in Downtown Brooklyn.

Roberts and her seven friends ordered 15 pies and set up a table by the Barclays Center. Soon other protesters began donating cases of water bottles, Band-Aids, masks and granola bars. The group called itself “Peaceful Pizza.” As they distributed snacks to the protesters, they joined in the chanting, “No justice, no peace,” and blasted “Waiting On the World to Change” by John Mayer through a speaker.

“I’m a black woman, so I can relate to the injustices and discrimination people are facing,” Roberts said.

Roberts has spent the last two months social distancing, but she said the protests felt more important to her than staying home to prevent any possible exposure to the virus. “I know the pandemic is still happening, but it’s not my focus. The brutality we’re seeing is scarier to me than Covid. Especially the brutality you’re seeing in these protests, where people can be pepper sprayed or attacked just for being in the vicinity.”

The positive response Roberts saw to her pizza distribution gave her some hope. “People wanted to give money and water and help out,” she said. “That’s the moment I was like, ‘OK there’s still good in the world.’ Positivity is contagious.”

Shoshana, St. Mary’s Park, Bronx

Shoshana, 35, is a middle school teacher in the Bronx. She has spent the last few months fearing for the well-being of her students and community. “Many of the students I work with have been arrested,” she said. “We can’t even protect ourselves from the coronavirus because we’re being targeted. I’m marching for our freedom and liberation to live in a world where we’re not being targeted and murdered.”

She spent five hours on Saturday marching through the Bronx to St. Mary’s Park. On 142nd Street, a police officer stepped in front of Shoshana and tried to grab her arm. Other protesters intervened, stepping in between them and urging the officer to leave her alone.

As she walked, Shoshana chanted a song written by The Peace Poets, a protest group that composed these lyrics after Eric Garner’s death in 2014: “I still hear my brother crying ‘I can’t breathe,’” she sang. “Now I’m in the struggle singing ‘I can’t leave’.”

*Shoshana prefers not to use her full name because of safety concerns.

Chloe Wallace, Williamsburg, Brooklyn

Chloe Wallace, 26, lives near the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway in Williamsburg. On Sunday afternoon she heard helicopters overhead in the neighborhood and realized there must be protesters coming. She ran downstairs and joined the march on Bedford Avenue.

Wallace was worried, for a moment, about exposure to the coronavirus. Although she wore a mask, she also knew that she and her boyfriend would soon be visiting their aging parents. But she felt that as a white person it was important for her to show up in protest. She was reminded of this especially last week, when she watched the viral video of a white woman, Amy Cooper, calling the police on a black man bird-watching in Central Park.

“I want to recognize my role in the unequal society and systems we’ve created,” Wallace said. “Listening to what black people are saying and showing up is the only way forward.”

Protests Draw Shoulder-to-Shoulder Crowds After Months of Virus Isolation,"CHICAGO — For days, Kate Dixon has been watching the videos of demonstrations from her home in a Denver suburb: the images of young people packed shoulder to shoulder, the crowds shouting in unison on downtown streets, the occasional détente between protester and police officer that ends in a hug.

“You want that to be a wonderful moment,” said Ms. Dixon, a stay-at-home mother who has been sewing face masks in her spare time. “But your heart just hurts at all the illness this could be causing.”

In the last week, the United States has abruptly shifted from one crippling crisis to the next. Most Americans had been under stay-at-home orders for months to slow the coronavirus pandemic, restrictions that were gradually eased throughout May, freeing people in many states to begin venturing back into shops and restaurants.

Then came Memorial Day in Minneapolis, when George Floyd, a black man, died after pleading that he could not breathe as a white police officer pressed his knee into Mr. Floyd’s neck. His death has prompted cascading protests in hundreds of cities, where demonstrators have called for an end to police brutality and racist institutions.

Suddenly America no longer looks like a nation cooped up at home.

The demonstrations have spurred fears that they could cause a deadly resurgence of the coronavirus. And for those sympathetic to a growing movement, deciding whether to attend protests has been complicated: Some people have avoided them entirely, reasoning that the chance of contracting the coronavirus in a crowd is too high. Others have joined despite the risks.

“The police violence against black people — that’s a pandemic, too,” said Kelli Ann Thomas, a community organizer who joined protests in Miami. “People are willing to risk their lives, to risk their health, to show solidarity with black people.”

No one has studied the precise dynamics of how the virus may be transmitted under the mix of conditions that prevail at mass protests. And because of delays between exposure to the virus and the start of symptoms, and then hospitalizations and deaths, the impact of the protests on virus spread will not be known for several weeks.

Health experts know that the virus is far less likely to be spread outdoors than indoors. And masks reduce the chance of infected people transmitting the respiratory droplets that contain the virus.

But many uncertainties remain. Yelling, shouting and singing can increase how far those droplets are projected. Crowds and the length of time an uninfected person is near someone who is infected also increase the risk of transmission.

Protests have revealed a range of precautions, from people wearing tightly secured masks to others with no face covering. On Monday, a nurse’s assistant who works at a nursing home was among the protesters at the site where Mr. Floyd died in Minneapolis, showing up in a mask and scrubs.

Contagion was weighing on the mind of Jamie Schwesnedl in the first days of protests. Mr. Schwesnedl owns Moon Palace Books, down the street from a police station that was set on fire last weekend after demonstrators clashed with the police.

Black people were already suffering from a disproportionate number of coronavirus infections; now many members of their communities are protesting the death of Mr. Floyd.

“The idea of getting a whole lot of people together to yell, which we know is one of the most effective ways to transmit the virus, and having that happen around a lot of people of color and neighborhoods and communities of color, is very stressful,” said Mr. Schwesnedl, who is white. “It just adds this whole stress of how this is going to impact the infection rates.”

In Denver, Tay Anderson, a protest leader and school board member, has been worried about the disparate impact of the coronavirus on black Colorado residents like himself. Thousands of people marched through Denver and laid down, shoulder to shoulder, on the lawn of the Capitol in silent demonstrations.

He put out a call on social media for all protesters to join him in getting tested for the coronavirus on Saturday morning at the Pepsi Center, a sports and concert arena where Denver has been running free, large-scale testing.

“WE ARE STILL IN A PANDEMIC,” he wrote on Twitter.

In Los Angeles, city leaders have expressed alarm that the protests could fuel the spread of the coronavirus, while at the same time voicing support for the rights of demonstrators to gather and saying that they shared in the outrage over the death of Mr. Floyd.

Mayor Eric Garcetti warned that the gatherings could become “superspreader events” — not unlike during the 1918 flu pandemic when, after the first wave of infections, some cities began holding parades and large gatherings that led to a second, more deadly wave.

Some of the city’s virus testing sites have had to be shut down briefly, and while jail populations had been reduced over concerns about the spread of the virus in tightly controlled institutions, they now are filling again after mass arrests.

Though the pandemic has slowed somewhat in recent weeks, the virus continues to infect thousands and kill hundreds every day. Many of the country’s big cities have been adding several hundred new cases every day. On Monday, nearly 1,000 new cases were identified in Los Angeles County, Calif., more than 500 in Cook County, Ill., and more than 400 in New York City. In the county that includes Minneapolis, more than 1,000 new cases have been identified over the past week and officials have urged protesters to seek coronavirus testing.

Epidemiologists said the protests would almost certainly lead to more cases of the virus. Large gatherings of people are known to have led to chains of transmission in other settings. And police tactics such as spraying tear gas, which causes people to cough; herding protesters into smaller areas for crowd control; and placing arrested individuals in buses, vans and holding cells also increase the risk of infection.

An aggregate model assembled by researchers at the University of Massachusetts projects that the nation will see between 5,000 to 7,000 deaths from Covid-19 each week over the next month.

But public health experts emphasized that police violence against black people in America also represents a public health crisis. The anger over economic, social and health disparities fueling the protests, health experts said, are reflected in sharply higher rates of coronavirus-related death and illness among black Americans. Several counseled a “harm reduction” approach that would allow people to join the demonstrations as safely as possible.

“Last week, all the news was about Covid; this week, all the news is about the protests,” said Eleanor Murray, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Boston University School of Public Health. “But really, these are two pieces of the same conversation.’’

Yolanda Williams, the host of the podcast “Parenting Decolonized,"" which focuses on parenting black children, said she has not attended protests in Little Rock, Ark., where she lives. She is a single mother of a toddler, and her area has seen a spike in Covid-19 cases.

But she had a message on her Facebook page for those among her followers who are white: You should be showing up.

“I know it’s scary, but if you are committed to dismantling white supremacy, it’s you that needs to be out there, en masse, protesting as loud for civil rights as you did for the Women’s March,” she said in the post.

In an interview on Tuesday, Ms. Williams said she was trying to drive home the point that it is far riskier for black people to attend protests than it is for white people.

“The problem is, we are having to choose from either dying from Covid or dying from cops,” she said. “Put yourself on the line like we are doing every day. Put your body on the line.”

For many public health experts who have spent weeks advising policymakers and the public on how to reduce their risk of getting or inadvertently spreading the coronavirus, the mass demonstrations have forced a shift in perspective.

Tiffany Rodriguez, an epidemiologist who has rarely left her home since mid-March, said it was often impossible to maintain the recommended six feet of distance at the protest she attended in Boston on Sunday. But “understanding that police brutality is a public health epidemic,” she said she felt compelled to go.

Birmingham Mayor Orders Removal of Confederate Monument in Public Park,"As the sun set on an extraordinary day of civil unrest across America, the mayor of Birmingham, Ala., ordered the removal of a contentious Confederate statue from a public park.

One day after dozens of protesters targeted the statue, the 115-year-old Confederate Soldiers & Sailors Monument in Linn Park, defacing and chipping away at its base, the mayor said it would be removed. A large crane arrived shortly before 8 p.m., in the final hours of Jefferson Davis Day, the state holiday in Alabama honoring the Confederate leader.

The statue has been at the center of a legal fight between the city and the state’s attorney general’s office, with the city wanting it removed but ultimately losing the battle. Still, Randall Woodfin, the mayor of the majority black city, approved the removal on Monday in defiance of the Alabama Monuments Preservation Act, setting the stage for another showdown.

On Sunday night, demonstrators gathered at the park, in downtown Birmingham, to protest the death last week of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer in Minneapolis pressed his left knee into Mr. Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes.

Protests have since spread across the country, and the officer, Derek Chauvin, has since been fired and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.

In Linn Park on Sunday, the demonstration turned violent. Some of the protesters targeted the statue’s 52-foot-tall sandstone obelisk, spray-painting and chipping at its base. They also tried to topple it using a rope and a truck, according to news media reports.

On Monday, Mr. Woodfin vowed to take it down. He said its very presence would cause more unrest and division and would pose continued threats to public safety, outweighing any legal implications.

“In order to prevent more civil unrest, it is very imperative that we remove this statue,” Mr. Woodfin told AL.com, the website for The Birmingham News. “I understand the A.G.’s office can bring a civil suit against the city, and if there’s a judgment rendered from a judge then we should be held accountable, and I am willing to accept that because that is a lower cost than civil unrest in our city.”

By about 8 p.m. Monday, heavy equipment arrived at the park, including a crane, a forklift and a flatbed trailer. Once the statue is removed, it will be taken to an undisclosed location.

The monument had been covered with a tarp while the lawsuit between the state attorney general and the city played out. Last year, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that the city had to pay a $25,000 fine for its obstruction of the monument, according to Mike Lewis, a spokesman for the attorney general’s office.

The attorney general, Steve Marshall, vowed to file a new civil complaint against the city if the monument was removed.

Across the country, in at least six states, anger over Mr. Floyd’s death has given way to the damaging or defacing of more than a dozen symbols of the Confederacy.

“In the same way people may view the police as the front face of the state, Confederate symbols are seen as the front face of a white supremacist ideology,” said Susan Glisson, who owns a Mississippi consulting firm specializing in racial dialogue and healing. “So it’s no surprise they were targeted.”

Last year, Mr. Woodfin offered to give the statue away free. The pitch was just another chapter in a long heritage-versus-hate discussion about what to do with Confederate symbols.

“Any Confederate museum that wants this thing can have it,” Mr. Woodfin said in a 2019 interview. “I’ll give it to them right now. Hell, I’m even willing to give them whatever they need to get it to them.”"
Was That a Firecracker or a Gunshot? Unpredictability on America’s Streets,"If one element binds the demonstrations that have roiled the cities and towns of America for the last week — beyond the full-throated cry for an end to racial and social injustice — it is the nerve-jangling unpredictability: the uneasy sense that everything could change in an instant.

All that has been required is the firing of one rubber bullet. The spraying of one can of mace. The tossing of one lighted firecracker. One precipitating action.

Take Sunday, for example, the last day of a difficult May. Hundreds of fraught confrontations played out across the country between protesters and police officers, some devolving into violence in a finger snap.

In Atlanta, a mostly peaceful protest march turned into a hailstorm of tear-gas canisters after demonstrators toppled a fence. In Denver, a bearded young man in a sea of protesters crumpled to the ground when a projectile fired by the police struck him in the face. And in Washington, a tense standoff quickly became a conflagration that included a fire in the basement of a historic church that President Trump would briefly stand in front of for a photo op — presumably to convey order — the next day.

Unpredictability infuses the air.

And what does unpredictability smell like? It is the commingling of street sweat and fire smoke and tear gas. The smoke smacks of destruction, while the tear gas seems to set your face aflame, burning your throat and causing your eyes to tear so badly that it seems you may never stop crying.

In this protracted state of unrest not seen in this country in a half-century, any certainty was absent, with the anger, fear and opportunism of demonstrations filling the void. Was that a firecracker or a gunshot?

Nights in America are now when the fever burns the hottest — a fever that set in on Memorial Day, when Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, pressed his knee to the neck of George Floyd, a black man lying facedown on a Minneapolis street, for nearly nine minutes. The tactic was employed against a man accused of fobbing off a counterfeit $20 bill, and whose death was captured in a widely disseminated video.

Mr. Chauvin was ultimately charged with third-degree murder, but the demonstrations of fury triggered by the encounter have shown no signs of abating, with some protesters demanding the arrests of three other Minneapolis officers at the scene.

The horrific death of Mr. Floyd followed an all-too-familiar pattern of black boys and men being killed by the police; the names of others — Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Michael Brown among them — are embedded in the American consciousness.

What’s more, the demonstrations are taking place in the midst of another unsettling American reality. In little more than three months, the coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 100,000 Americans, pushed another 40 million into unemployment, and upended much of everyday life.

These realities now run like an undercurrent through hundreds of protests in small towns and large cities. Some were heated but peaceful. Some seemed relatively calm, only to explode into personal injury and property damage. And some devolved into chaos, causing the kind of damage that volunteers with brooms could not sweep away in the morning.

At a Sunday evening protest in Oakland, Calif., a 5-year-old boy named Chase Butler hung out the back window of his family’s white minivan, his right hand raised in a fist, his left holding a cardboard sign that said: “Mama! I can’t breath. Don’t shoot.”

His father, Donovan Butler, 33, said he had had a talk — the talk — with his son. “The world we live in is not equal,” Mr. Butler said he explained. “People look at us different.”

More often, though, the talk on Sunday came in the form of chants and shouts and police orders barked through loudspeakers. More often, the dynamic was too fluid and uncertain to guarantee the safety of a 5-year-old boy, or even that of a family in a minivan.

In Atlanta, hundreds of protesters marched for miles in peace, chanting out their cries for justice. Then, at the edge of Centennial Olympic Park, an organizer warned them to veer away because demonstrators ahead of them were clashing with the police. Few listened, even as others warned them of tear gas and conflict.

“Oh, y’all going the wrong way,” one man said. He received a few insults in return for his concern.

Then somebody tipped over a portable toilet at a construction site. Then people started chanting. Then a group of young, masked white men began tearing apart a blue-tarped fence that was blocking the street, ignoring a black woman’s cries to stop because “They’re going to blame it on us.”

The fence came down, and hell broke loose. Firecrackers. Running. A plume of tear gas, its canisters clattering on the pavement. The burning of faces and eyes, the streams of tears and mucus, the only relief coming from a man squirting a milky solution from a bottle.

In Minneapolis, where Mr. Floyd was killed and where the protests began nearly a week earlier, a similar confrontation unfolded shortly after the 8 p.m. curfew — and, thus, with an air of inevitability.

As a beautiful sunset took shape, hundreds of vociferous protesters clustered near a gas station and Bobby & Steve’s Auto World downtown, all but boxed in by walls of police officers wearing body armor and holding batons.

“We’re just sitting ducks,” a man said.

A committed group sat and knelt in the street and continued to chant. “We’re saying we’re sick of this!” a woman shouted into a megaphone, to which the crowd responded, “No justice, no peace.”

A helicopter buzzed overhead, as the numbers of police officers and members of the National Guard multiplied.

Then, suddenly, at 8:43 p.m., the police fired tear gas into the crowd, a plume arcing across the sky. Stumbling and coughing, some demonstrators took cover behind gas pumps. Some held up their hands and chanted, “Hands up! Don’t shoot!” And some took another form of action, filming it all on their cellphones.

With the warm air charged with the acrid smell of tear gas, the walls of the police began to close in. A few protesters tried to run, but soon realized there was no use; they were surrounded.

A young man with a skateboard ran across the gas station lot in a vain attempt to escape. He pleaded with a guardsman that he simply wanted to go home.

“You were supposed to go home an hour ago,” the guardsman answered.

Then came a voice booming from the loudspeaker of an armored vehicle. “This is the Minnesota State Patrol,” the voice said. “Lay down. You’re under arrest. Get down on the ground.”

Among those arrested was Kevin Trinh. He said that he had been hit in the thigh with a projectile, and that he had only come to the protests to take photographs.

“My mom is probably worried,” Mr. Trinh said, his voice quavering. “I want my mom.”

The police lined up the demonstrators, bound with flex cuffs, and led them to waiting vans. The process was strangely cordial; people who seemed like enemy combatants moments earlier were now just people talking.

But a peaceful resolution to an anxious standoff was not uniformly realized. At about the same time the confrontation in Minneapolis ended, a woman was shot in the arm in Walnut Creek, Calif., in the midst of the widespread looting of dozens of stores. The city, about 25 miles east of San Francisco, immediately imposed a curfew, with police officers sealing a freeway exit with flares and traffic cones.

In Washington, an ugly push-and-pull between protesters and the police continued. Demonstrators poured accelerants on a wooden pole supporting a “ROAD WORK AHEAD” sign and set it on fire in the middle of H Street, adding further fuel with branches wrenched from nearby trees. A small fire was also set in the basement nursery of the 204-year-old St. John’s Church — known as the “church of presidents” — causing relatively minor damage.

The dull clunk of projectiles against the raised shields of police officers echoed through Lafayette Square, across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. It was just one of the many jarring sounds of violence and vandalism unfolding a few hundred yards from where the President of the United States and his family were protected this night by a phalanx of National Guard troops.

Across the country and into the night, the unpredictability continued, now peaceful, now not.

In Seattle, demonstrators knelt before police blockades to convey their peaceful intent, and were rewarded with the invitation to continue their march of protest.

In Los Angeles, troops holding M4 rifles stood on the steps of City Hall, while protesters taunted soldiers and police officers in the streets. One moment a woman was offering her hand to a soldier who accepted it — leading to a hug. The next, another woman was taunting a black officer, yelling, “Do you get bonuses to shoot black people?”

In Denver, hundreds marched through streets thick with the cough-inducing remnants of tear gas. Protesters wore ski goggles and scuba masks to protect their eyes. Fireworks exploded overhead, emitting a sound that could easily be mistaken for gunfire.

And in New York, well into Monday morning, people walked the streets of the SoHo neighborhood with armloads of goods just stolen from smashed-in luxury stores, as two New York Police Department vans drove down Houston Street. The officers inside those vans could be seen with their heads bowed.

Over all, the night of uncertainty carried a strange feeling of anonymity. Many police officers were concealed behind riot-gear armor, with many protesters wearing masks and scarves, and not only because of the highly contagious coronavirus.

It was as though the country could not quite recognize itself.

Trump Deploys the Full Might of Federal Law Enforcement to Crush Protests,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s vow to “dominate” demonstrators protesting police brutality has mobilized the full might of federal law enforcement, from border agencies and the Drug Enforcement Administration to F.B.I. hostage rescue teams, working alongside local law enforcement, the military police and the National Guard.

The extraordinary deployments have reached the streets of San Diego, Buffalo and Las Vegas.

But nowhere is the show of force as strong as in Washington, where Mr. Trump is seeking to demonstrate his might by flooding the city’s downtown with agents from the F.B.I., the Bureau of Prisons, the U.S. Marshals, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Homeland Security Investigations, Customs and Border Protection and the Defense Department, turning the nation’s capital into a heavily armed federal fortress. Even Transportation Security Administration officers have been called out of the airports to help protect federal property in the “national capital region.”

“D.H.S. and its partners will not allow anarchists, disrupters and opportunists to exploit the ongoing civil unrest to loot and destroy our communities,” said Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “While the department respects every American’s right to protest peacefully, violence and civil unrest will not be tolerated. We will control the situation and protect the American people and the homeland at any cost.”

In all, nearly a dozen federal agencies and components have joined in Mr. Trump’s effort to quell protests incited by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and ostensibly to put an end to rioting and looting — and determine whether anarchists and other extremist groups had infiltrated the protests.

But local officials say the federal response has gone beyond acceptable, verging on overkill. The mayor of the District of Columbia called it “shameful.” A Virginia county pulled its officers out of Washington rather than deploy alongside federal agents. The governor of Illinois said the federal presence had actually undercut efforts to restore law and order, while Texas said it needed no help from the U.S. military.

Regardless, Attorney General William P. Barr promised to deploy “even greater law enforcement resources” in Washington on Tuesday evening.

“I can’t remember the last time this number of federal agencies were brought together to try and deal with a large number of demonstrators,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a police research and policy organization. He said the rush of multiple federal forces into the city could be a recipe for “chaos.”

The tension is more evidence of a schism that has opened between federal and local governments — first over the pandemic and now over how to respond to protests provoked by a spate of killings of black people. Neither side has coordinated clearly with the other, and neither has been willing to take responsibility for some of the ugliest episodes between protesters and officers.

While mayors and governors express sympathy for the demonstrations, the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. have monitored the protests for domestic terrorist activity. The department said in a bulletin to law enforcement agencies that militia extremists and anarchists could use the protests to cause violence and mayhem, according to an official in possession of the document, who asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the memo.

The Justice Department said that it would deploy all of its forces, including hostage rescue teams and riots squads, and that it had given agents at the Drug Enforcement Administration the power to make arrests.

Customs and Border Protection said agents had arrest authority, including those on elite tactical teams that are preparing to deploy to cities and states.

Overnight Sunday, after protesters defaced the Treasury Department building and a part of St. John’s Church had caught on fire, administration officials decided it was essential to clear Lafayette Square and expand the amount of territory near the White House that was controlled by officers.

“President Trump directed Attorney General Barr to lead federal law enforcement efforts to assist in the restoration of order to the District of Columbia,” Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said on Monday.

To maintain control of a protest, the local police typically employ lines of officers to separate crowds and encourage uniformed officers to use discretion to de-escalate encounters with tense crowds, law enforcement experts said. But in Mr. Trump’s rush to assert dominance over the demonstrations, the local police on Monday night were joined by federal authorities who donned ballistic gear and carried riot shields. Military helicopters flew overhead.

At the request of the Justice Department, Customs and Border Protection dispatched border agents and tactical officers to cities throughout the country to assist the local police with the protests. The border agency’s air and marine operations branch, which uses aircrafts and drones, was directed to provide surveillance of the protests, including demonstrations in Detroit.

Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said in a tweet on Tuesday that the aircraft specialists were used in Buffalo to track people who hit officers with a vehicle.

Around 600 homeland security officials were deployed to the Washington area, including agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement who found out about the assignment from an alert shortly before noon telling them to prepare to aid the local police.

The agency responsible for arresting and deporting undocumented immigrants deployed “specialized teams” to major cities to help contract security officers in the Federal Protective Service, another homeland security agency, provide security at federal buildings.

The Secret Service was also directed to bolster protective shifts of uniformed officers at the White House.

But communication issues between the state and federal authorities seemed to come as quickly as each deployment. Washington’s mayor, Muriel E. Bowser, learned from neighboring local leaders that National Guard support was headed for Washington, and she resisted.

Hours after protesters in Lafayette Square were pepper-sprayed and rammed by federal authorities armed with riot shields, the Arlington County Board in suburban Northern Virginia ordered its police force — which had been helping to patrol the protests in Washington — to return, saying their mutual aid agreement had been “abused.”

When multiple federal agencies are rushed out to assist local law enforcement, “you can have chaos,” Mr. Wexler said. Each agency has different use-of-force policies and different de-escalation training.

Eugene O’Donnell, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, agreed. “It’s like sending the firefighters in for a police call,” he said. “A lot of them are investigators. They’re not urban street cops.”

On Monday, video footage captured U.S. Park Police officers in riot gear delivering multiple blows to a news camera crew in Lafayette Square. Federal officials were shown pushing demonstrators over to make way for Mr. Trump’s photo opportunity in front of St. John’s.

For the next few hours, the protest remained largely peaceful as the local police allowed the demonstrators to march through the streets. Teams from the F.B.I. and the D.E.A. lined side streets. But shortly before 10 p.m., military helicopters lowered to rooftop level in the Chinatown area of Washington. Around the same time, some storefronts were shattered by protesters.

The helicopters sent gusts of dust into the air, causing one tree to split and nearly hit bystanders. Demonstrators fled a couple of blocks where they were met by authorities who began to toss what appeared to be smoke canisters.

Community “police like to go out with a soft approach,” Mr. Wexler said.

“They wear a regular uniform. They don’t put on the heavy gear, the riot gear. They keep that in reserve,” he continued. “What they recognized is if you bring out people in riot gear to begin with, you’re basically sending this message.”

That message, he said, is: “We expect trouble or we don’t trust you.”

That was not the approach of federal law enforcement officers who surrounded dozens of protesters late Monday on a residential street and fired chemicals at them, a moment that was photographed and shared by residents. A stranger who heard their cries for help let them shelter in his home until the city’s curfew lifted, while law enforcement waited outside to arrest them.

To Mr. Trump and Mr. Barr, the raucous night was a success.

Mr. Barr called Monday evening “a more peaceful night in the District of Columbia.”

Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, sent a letter to the Secret Service director, James Murray, criticizing the agency for using what he described as tear gas.

“I write to you stunned, disturbed and furious at the sight of federal authorities tear-gassing peaceful protesters in Lafayette Park, outside the White House, last night, in order to clear the way for the president to walk over and hold a Bible in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church,” Mr. Thompson wrote. “It is shameful.”

When asked who decided to use rubber bullets and chemicals to clear clergy members from the patio of St. John’s and peaceful protesters from the park, all of the federal agencies contacted declined to answer."
Protesters Dispersed With Tear Gas So Trump Could Pose at Church,"WASHINGTON — People who gathered outside the White House to protest police brutality spent Monday waving signs and screaming for justice. They watched as police officers and National Guard units flooded Lafayette Square, delivering on a threat made by President Trump. And just before the city’s 7 p.m. curfew went into effect, they were hit with flash-bang explosions and doused with tear gas.

It was because the president, who spent part of the weekend in a secure bunker as protests roiled, wanted to have his picture taken holding a Bible at a battered church just beyond the gates.

That church, St. John’s — the so-called Church of the Presidents because every one since James Madison has attended — had been briefly set ablaze as the protests devolved on Sunday evening. After Mr. Trump’s aides spent much of Monday expressing outrage over the burning of a place of worship, Hope Hicks, a presidential adviser, eventually hatched a plan with others at the White House to have the president walk over to the building, according to an official familiar with the events.

As Mr. Trump delivered a speech in the Rose Garden vowing to send the military to states where governors could not bring rioting under control but calling himself “an ally of all peaceful protesters,” the sound of explosions and the yells of demonstrators could be heard. After receiving repeated warnings to disperse before the city’s curfew, the crowd was tear-gassed.

Mr. Trump began his walk to the church at 7:01 p.m. for a photo session that lasted about 17 minutes. On his way over, after protesters had been driven from the park, he was trailed by a group of aides, including Attorney General William P. Barr. Mr. Barr had strolled to the edge of the police line to observe the crowd in the minutes before the tear-gassing began.

He walked alongside Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, and Ivanka Trump, his eldest daughter and senior adviser. Ms. Trump was wearing a mask, one of the few visible reminders on Monday that the administration was in the middle of battling a public health crisis. Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, Ms. Hicks and Mark Meadows, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, were also among the cadre of aides.

As police sirens blared in the background, Mr. Trump, his lips set in a thin line, stood with his back to the boarded-up, graffiti-laden facade of the buttermilk yellow church.

He cradled a Bible, bouncing it in his hands as if testing its weight.

“Is that your Bible?” a reporter yelled.

“It’s a Bible,” Mr. Trump responded, and hoisted up the book so reporters could see.

The bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, who watched the scene unfold while away from the church visiting with her mother, said church officials were not told of the plan and expressed outrage at the White House’s use of riot-control tactics on a generally peaceful crowd to clear a path for the president.

“He did not pray,” the bishop, Mariann E. Budde, said in an interview. Referring to the death of the black man in police custody that set off the protests, she added: “He did not mention George Floyd, he did not mention the agony of people who have been subjected to this kind of horrific expression of racism and white supremacy for hundreds of years. We need a president who can unify and heal. He has done the opposite of that, and we are left to pick up the pieces.”

In Lafayette Square, one of the visiting priests attending to St. John’s was sprayed with tear gas as she tried to help scared demonstrators leave the area, said Bishop Budde, who was not at the church when Mr. Trump visited.

Bishop Budde denounced the way the president held up a Bible during his visit, a move she interpreted as a political prop.

“The Bible is not an American document,” she said. “It’s not an expression of our country. It’s an expression of the human struggle to serve and love and know God.”

The president has been an infrequent visitor to St. John’s, but attended a church service there on the day of his inauguration. Since his election, the church has been dragged into the backdrop of some of Mr. Trump’s most partisan fights. Last spring, Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who led the investigation surrounding the Trump campaign’s ties to Russian interference in the 2016 election, drew a gawking crowd outside St. John’s before his report was released.

‘Everybody Will Second-Guess’: Liberal Mayors Navigate Protesters and Police,"LOS ANGELES — It’s a moment that mayors can still describe, months or years later. The first time they get the call: A police officer has killed someone, often that person is black or Latino, and a neighborhood is enraged.

What happens next is often one of the most consequential political balancing acts in American governance. The mayors of America’s larger cities, nearly all members of the Democratic Party and some of whom are black or Latino themselves, must reckon with political priorities that appear in conflict — living up to their rhetoric as champions of marginalized communities while maintaining a close working relationship with police departments often accused of inflicting harm.

“It’s a challenge,” said Mayor Michael Tubbs of Stockton, Calif., a Democrat who is the city’s first black mayor and, at 29, its youngest. “You’re part of the group that has been historically oppressed by government, and then you’re in charge of trying to make the government work.”

He described the challenge in biblical terms: “For some folks, they expect me to be Moses and, with my hands up, say ‘Peace’ and everyone goes quiet.”

As dozens of mayors nationwide now confront nightly protests and huge police deployments in their streets, even Democrats who ran on a platform of police reform and community engagement are trying to balance support for law enforcement with their continuing commitment to change. Last week, after destructive protests erupted across the country in response to the death of George Floyd, a black man who was killed in police custody in Minneapolis, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City said the police there had showed “a lot of restraint.” In Los Angeles, where a peaceful protest turned to mayhem on Saturday night, Mayor Eric Garcetti angered some progressives when he called in the National Guard, just hours after he said doing so was unnecessary.

“Everybody will second-guess,” Mr. Garcetti said on Monday, referring not just to the decision to call in the Guard, but also to the police tactics that included using tear gas and arresting peaceful protesters who refused to move. He said that complaints of police misconduct during the protests would be investigated. “We’ve all read the history books,” he said.

In interviews with more than a dozen Democrats who currently or have previously served as local leaders in high-populated areas, they describe a complex web of political incentives that shape the relationship between mayor and law enforcement, and can turn the candidate with the most liberal reform promises into a conservative champion of law and order once in office.

For some, police autonomy was a necessary cost of maintaining public safety, and of pleasing rank-and-file officers and more moderate voters. Others described a network of shared political consequences that make it hard for a mayor to upset key groups — the police, police unions, local prosecutors and others — particularly if City Hall is seen as a step to higher office.

Larry Krasner, the district attorney in Philadelphia who ran on a reform platform, said local leaders are generally afraid to cross police unions, because of the political clout the unions hold.

“Being close to the leadership of the police union means, ‘Do you have our back?’” he said. “Which really means, ‘Do you have our back more than you have the back of your citizens?’”

Julián Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio who made police misconduct a centerpiece of his presidential campaign last year, said city officials should be doing more on police reform.

In his view, many local Democrats are more focused on supporting police unions than considering possible harm done to black and Latino residents.

“There’s a detachment from this issue that needs to change,” he said.

Since the emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2013, perhaps no issue has caused more friction between Democratic elected officials and the party’s activist base than criminal justice and policing. During her 2016 presidential bid, Hillary Clinton was prodded to embrace systemic reforms to policing, and so has former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the party’s presumptive 2020 nominee. Candidates in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary race, which represented a historically diverse field, were repeatedly pushed on the issue, often by younger black and Latino activists. The fights between progressive insurgents and Democratic incumbents in the House have used criminal justice reform as a wedge.

But in the past week, as a wave of unrest has consumed cities across the United States, Democratic mayors are increasingly in the spotlight. President Trump on Monday night threatened to deploy the military if mayors do not “establish an overwhelming presence until the violence is quelled.” The careful calibration of liberal leaders, between projecting empathy for the protesters and denouncing property destruction and theft, shows their progressive ideals being put to a high-stakes practical test. Some of the mayors navigating this turbulence came of age well after the tumult of the 1960s and are fluent in the language of social activism, seeking a way to stand out from their predecessors.

Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta announced on Sunday that two officers were fired and three others were demoted after a video captured by local news media showed them pulling a woman from her car and using a stun gun on another man. Mayor Greg Fischer of Louisville fired the city’s police chief on Monday, after learning that police officers did not record body camera footage during the fatal shooting of a black business owner, David McAtee, that took place that day.

Though mayors have repeatedly condemned vandalism, fewer have spoken critically of the police officers’ conduct, despite public outcry.

“The concerns are legitimate and deserve attention, and the majority of people who are protesting are doing so peacefully,” said Mayor Kate Gallego of Phoenix. “But as a mayor I feel like I have to say we cannot stand for violence, that setting trees on fire and burning cars is not the answer.”

In Los Angeles, where people have marched downtown and in the Fairfax neighborhood in recent days, the events of 1992 are never far from memory. In the decades since the uprising that followed the acquittal of the four officers who beat Rodney King, the Los Angeles Police Department has instituted many reforms, earning support from activists who were once vocal critics. But the department has faced several protests after officer-involved shootings in recent years. Still, Mr. Garcetti said in an interview that most large cities lag behind in adopting similar changes.

“We have to figure out a way to humanize both sides of the barricades right now,” he said. “First and foremost, to humanize black people in this country who have disproportionately been dehumanized. But it can’t ever be a one-way street to dehumanize a person who wears a badge. We need them to hear us, but we need to hear them or else we’re going to isolate them into islands that results in the sort of policing we don’t want to see.”

Jane Castor, the mayor of Tampa, Fla., spent more than two decades in the Police department there, eventually rising to become chief — a key part of her appeal as a political leader.

“I don’t know that there is any one person or any one group that despises police brutality more than police officers,” Ms. Castor said in an interview. “As a community we need to acknowledge that George Floyd was murdered, that those actions constituted homicide and then to also recognize and try to understand the pain that is being felt in the black and brown communities.”

On Monday afternoon, Mr. Biden held a virtual round table with Mr. Garcetti, Ms. Bottoms, Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago and Mayor Melvin Carter of St. Paul, Minn. The former vice president said he sympathized with protesters’ concerns but also denounced “violence that endangers lives and guts local businesses is no way forward.”

Ms. Lightfoot, who faced some criticism during her 2018 mayoral run about her record of police accountability as leader of the Chicago Police Board, said mayors supported peaceful expression of dissent but were focused on rooting out bad officers. 

“Look, we’ve had our fair share of dark days in Chicago around police violence and shooting,” she said. “But I do think it’s important for us to not allow forces of darkness to conflate people’s righteous anger and need to express themselves in their protected First Amendment rights.”

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba of Jackson, Miss., said it was time for the party to embrace not just police reform, but “deconstructing the criminal justice system.” Mr. Lumumba, 37, said even if this moment seemed like a flash point, the inequities, racism and despair that create the tension run much deeper.

“There’s an economic reliance on the system of policing,” Mr. Lumumba said. “You have more police today than you ever had. You have city police, county police, state police, federal police, secret police, secret police that watch the secret police. You have probation and parole officers, prison guards, companies that contract out with the prison.”

“We rely on the overincarceration of our society,” he said.

Crime control bills helmed by Mr. Biden in the late 1980s and early 1990s helped transform the relationship between local, state, and federal justice systems. In Monday’s round table with mayors, Mr. Biden said public officials needed to reckon with police brutality, citing the “incredible pain and legitimate anger that is the root of these protests.”

This was not always his position. In a 1994 speech on the Senate floor, Mr. Biden was unequivocal — more police officers made people safer.

“Anybody who does not want cops, then do not ask for them; send them my way,” he said at the time. “Send them to Philadelphia, Wilmington, Trenton, the area I live in. And my daughter will be safer, my wife will be safer, my mother will be safer, and I will be safer. And I will be happy.”

How George Floyd Was Killed in Police Custody,"On May 25, Minneapolis police officers arrested George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, after a convenience store employee called 911 and told the police that Mr. Floyd had bought cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill. Seventeen minutes after the first squad car arrived at the scene, Mr. Floyd was unconscious and pinned beneath three police officers, showing no signs of life.

By combining videos from bystanders and security cameras, reviewing official documents and consulting experts, The New York Times reconstructed in detail the minutes leading to Mr. Floyd’s death. Our video shows officers taking a series of actions that violated the policies of the Minneapolis Police Department and turned fatal, leaving Mr. Floyd unable to breathe, even as he and onlookers called out for help.

The day after Mr. Floyd’s death, the Police Department fired all four of the officers involved in the episode. On May 29, the Hennepin County attorney, Mike Freeman, announced third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges against Derek Chauvin, the officer seen most clearly in witness videos pinning Mr. Floyd to the ground. Mr. Chauvin, who is white, kept his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for at least eight minutes and 15 seconds, according to a Times analysis of timestamped video. Our video investigation shows that Mr. Chauvin did not remove his knee even after Mr. Floyd lost consciousness and for a full minute and 20 seconds after paramedics arrived at the scene.

On June 3, Hennepin County prosecutors added a more serious second-degree murder charge against Mr. Chauvin and also charged each of the three other former officers — Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao — with aiding and abetting second-degree murder.

On June 18, the Hennepin County attorney’s office said that its criminal complaint misstated the amount of time Mr. Chauvin kept his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck. The complaint originally said that Mr. Chauvin had done so for eight minutes and 46 seconds, a length of time that became a symbol and rallying cry for protesters. Responding to inquiries from journalists who noted a discrepancy with the durations listed in the complaint, the office said the actual time was seven minutes and 46 seconds. But The Times’s own analysis of the video shows that this revised time is also incorrect.

“It makes no difference,” said Jamar Nelson, who works with the families of crime victims in Minneapolis. “The bottom line is, it was long enough to kill him, long enough to execute him.”

"The Nation Seethes, and Trump’s Response Follows a Pattern","Good morning and welcome to On Politics, a daily political analysis of the 2020 elections based on reporting by New York Times journalists.

With protesters expressing a new level of outrage, President Trump blasts back — and Democrats seek to embrace a rising movement. It’s Monday, and this is your politics tip sheet.

Protests spread rapidly throughout the country over the weekend, beginning with calls for justice for George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned down his neck. They blossomed into a nationwide weekend of forceful demands for racial justice, as well as for a decrease in funding for police departments. In cities from New York to Los Angeles, paramilitary-attired police officers squared off with demonstrators by the thousands in some of the most bellicose mass protests of the past half-century.

President Trump’s response to the upheaval has followed a familiar pattern: He issued a statement that seemed to condone violence (“when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he tweeted, suggesting that the police could be justified in shooting protesters, and invoking a segregationist police chief from the 1960s); it was immediately met by a backlash. Only after a disquieting delay did he try to walk back the statement. It’s roughly the arc of countless similar incidents throughout his presidency, in which he has invariably sought to push the boundary to the right on what is considered acceptable discourse from a commander in chief — or from any major American politician.

Trump claimed later on Friday that he had been misinterpreted, and he said at a round-table discussion that he understood “the pain” behind the protests. But the president has made his position clear: He stands largely against the demonstrations, and in favor (as he has tweeted repeatedly since Friday) of “law and order.” His most pointed symbolic move of the weekend came on Sunday, when he said on Twitter that he would designate antifa — a loose collection of left-wing activists whose name stands for “anti-fascist” — as a terrorist organization. It remains unclear whether the president has the legal authority to make such a designation, but the strategic value was obvious: He was pointing attention toward one of today’s most belligerent leftist movements, while seeking to divert the spotlight away from the grievances of community-led protests in Minneapolis and other cities around the country. The growing death toll and economic devastation caused by the coronavirus went virtually unmentioned on Trump’s Twitter feed over the weekend.

But what about Joe Biden? For any presumptive Democratic nominee seeking to walk a moderate line, the specter of radical protests from the left in an election year would be grounds for concern. Studies show that since the 1960s, white voters in particular have been irked by the most aggressive forms of black activism. Democrats tend to fare poorly in elections held soon after urban uprisings and protests led by black people that include attacks on property. Democrats do better, the research suggests, in the wake of nonviolent black protest movements. But a rising tide of white racial awareness — driven partly by the circulation of videos showing police killings of black people, and partly by the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement — has coincided with an increasingly radical turn among millennials and Generation Z, changing the calculus of the Democratic Party.

Rather than simply urging protesters to stop damaging property and lighting structures ablaze, Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, sounded acutely aware of the delicate balance he needed to strike on Friday morning. “The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said. “Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching.” Just moments after Walz addressed Minnesotans, Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck even after he had become unresponsive, was arrested and charged with third-degree murder.

The protests have led many black leaders to amplify their demands for tangible commitments from Biden on pursuing racial justice. Those leaders mostly agree that at the very least, Biden should pick a black woman as his running mate. Meanwhile, the past week’s events have turned an unflattering spotlight on Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who is seen as a top contender to be Biden’s vice-presidential choice. She has been dogged by complaints about her work as the Hennepin County attorney in the early to mid-2000s; in that position, she declined to prosecute multiple cases against police officers who had been involved in shootings. One such case of alleged police violence involved Chauvin, though it was dismissed only after Klobuchar had left her post to join the Senate.

Twitter took a first-time step on Friday to rein in Trump’s onslaughts, attaching a warning to his tweet condoning violence against looters. It was the latest in an ongoing saga between the president and what is still his most-used social media platform (if perhaps no longer his favorite). Unlike the warnings Twitter pasted on two other Trump tweets last week, this one prevented the message from being seen on his feed unless users clicked to view it. Last week, angered that Twitter was putting limits on what he could get away with saying, Trump threatened to cut social media companies’ legal protections in lawsuits over defamatory speech, and he sicced his followers on an individual Twitter employee who he (falsely) said had censored him.

Demonstrators walked down an avenue in Brooklyn on Saturday. All weekend, they gathered across New York City, with peaceful protests interspersed with outbreaks of violence.

For months, national Republicans had hoped that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would return to Kansas and run for the Senate, confident that he could unite the party and keep the seat in Republican hands, as it has been since the 1930s.

But with Pompeo resistant to a run (not to mention mired in a congressional investigation into his use of State Department funds), and the June 1 filing deadline now at hand, Republicans are bracing for a messy intraparty brawl. And they’re increasingly anxious that a race in this deep-red state could be competitive in the fall.

Their biggest source of worry: the former Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach, a hard-line Trump supporter who lost the governor’s race to Laura Kelly, a Democrat, in 2018. Kobach is a well-known, if polarizing, figure in the state, and some Republicans worry that he could win the primary but lose the general election to State Senator Barbara Bollier, a moderate Democrat from suburban Kansas City.

Anti-Kobach Republicans appear increasingly inclined to unite around Representative Roger Marshall, a deeply conservative congressman from the rural western part of the state. Any Democrat running statewide in Kansas faces a major uphill battle — but both Republicans would test whether there are limits to the success of a message rooted in fealty to President Trump even in Republican territory.

"‘In Every City, There’s a George Floyd’: Portraits of Protest","For a week, cities across America have been theaters of dissent. The protesters are in the torched neighborhoods of Minneapolis. They are banging the barricades outside the White House, surging through New York’s Union Square, smashing shop windows in Beverly Hills.

The people giving voice to their anger are individual pieces of a movement, like drops of water to a wave. Their strength is in cohesiveness. Yet they are strangers, divided by geography, age, color and experience.

A 65-year-old black woman in Boston. The teenage daughter of undocumented immigrants in Los Angeles. A white stay-at-home mother from Austin, Texas.

They have all had enough.

“I can’t breathe,” read the signs carried by many protesters, echoing some of the last words of George Floyd, whose death in the custody of the Minneapolis police — his neck rammed under an officer’s knee — ignited a sudden, collective fury.

“It was a powder keg,” said Michael Sampson II, who was on the streets over the weekend in Jacksonville, Fla. “George Floyd was the last straw.”

“I am heartbroken and outraged every day,” said Candice Elder, who was marching in Oakland, Calif. “I’m tired of being sick and tired.”

Maybe at another time, in another year, Mr. Floyd’s death would have ended in a vigil, a few local marches, promises of reform.

But America was not prepared to accept the usual responses to this death, at this time. Not in the middle of a pandemic that has taken more than 100,000 lives, many of them black. Not in a country where unemployment, which has also hit African-Americans with disproportionate effect, is at its highest point in a century.

Fear. Anxiety. Anger. Desperation.

These are the moods of the moment. They have driven people to the streets, bound into a movement, draped in hopelessness.

Or is it hope?

A protest is an act of desperation and defiance. But why do it if not for the belief, however modest, that the voices in the street will be heard?

“People are tired of being harassed and murdered by the police, especially black folks. So now you take it across the country, and this is what you get. Anarchy.”

Don Hubbard, 44, Minneapolis

Don Hubbard said he had no choice but to come to Cup Foods, the store where a store clerk reported that Mr. Floyd had tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill, leading to the call to the police.

A Minneapolis native, Mr. Hubbard said 90 percent of his interactions with the police were negative, even though he has been a local government employee for years.

About 10 years ago, Mr. Hubbard said, the police stopped him as he came out of a store, saying that he “fit the description” of a man accused in a domestic dispute.

“I fit the description because I was black,” he said.

Mr. Hubbard said his co-worker, who was white, sat in the truck and looked the other way instead of vouching for him.

“I haven’t talked to that man since this day,” Mr. Hubbard said. “I think he’s a coward.”

Now working for the county, Mr. Hubbard said he was the only black construction employee in a staff of about 90. He drives a BMW and owns a house with a pool in suburban Brooklyn Park. But he still feels like the police define him by the color of his skin, and worries about his two sons and two daughters, ages 4 to 24.

“I come out here today on a nice day like this because I feel like if I don’t come out here, and we don’t all show up, then what are we doing?” Mr. Hubbard said. “We’re letting this man die in vain.”

At Hollywood High, Beatriz Lopez was one of two nonblack students performing with the hip-hop majorette dance team.

“Every single year there was an African-American assembly for students organized by the black student union,” Ms. Lopez said. “It was very emotional. They would read poems about police brutality. They would make slide shows remembering people who had passed away from police brutality that year. That resonated with me.”

The daughter of Mexican immigrants, Ms. Lopez identified with the way black people were treated by the police because she grew up worrying about how officers might interact with her parents.

“We always had something to be scared of because my parents are undocumented,” she said. “Every time I would see police, even now, I get some kind of anxiety. I feel like they will always have the upper hand. I feel that with a uniform and badge, they are in control of everyone around them. That infuriates me.”

The death of Mr. Floyd opened the doors.

“When my friend sent me that flyer about the protest, I felt I had to go,” she said. “I had been asking, ‘What can I do?’ ”

Ms. Lopez marched down Third Street with her three friends and thousands more people chanting for George Floyd and justice. When they arrived at the intersection of Third and La Cienega, they knelt.

“We felt the ground so hot and rough, and how he must have felt in that moment.”

“On one hand, it’s very scary, because I know a lot of really messed up stuff is happening, people are being hurt, property is being destroyed. But at the same time, something else is on the horizon.”

Chad Bennett and his father, wearing matching face masks, stood back in a parking lot as they watched protesters march past the Police Department in Ferguson, Mo., the site of numerous protests since Michael Brown, a black teenager, was killed by a white police officer there in 2014.

“When Ferguson happened, the whole world descended on us,” said Mr. Bennett, a graduate of Columbia College Chicago who works as an animator. “This time, it was like bam, bam, bam, city after city. I knew I had to be a part of it.”

Seeing the video of what happened to Mr. Floyd left him “numb,” he said. “It’s a silent rage, I guess,” he said. “I don’t know if I’m sad anymore. I’m just angry.”

JACKSONVILLE, FLA.

Michael Sampson is a community organizer who works with families whose sons were killed by the police.

“In every city, there’s a George Floyd,” he said.

Mr. Sampson is half Filipino and half African-American. His mother works two jobs, at a convenience store and as a housekeeper.

“Police brutality and Covid was the gasoline,” Mr. Sampson said of the protests. “Those videos sparked the fire. That’s why the country is on fire at this point. People are already suspicious of the criminal justice system, of white supremacy and how it affects people.”

Beth Muffett is a white stay-at-home mother and massage therapist. When officers outside City Hall used their bicycles to push back a crowd of protesters, she screamed and noted their badge numbers.

She ended up bruised, pepper-sprayed and outraged.

“I think there’s a real turn right now among moms who want to educate their kids to be post-racial,” said Ms. Muffett, whose daughter is nearly 4. “And so that’s led to a lot of moms on Facebook being like, ‘Your white silence is deafening.’”

“If you’re not standing up for George Floyd,” she said, “who’s going to stand up for you? It’s just a level of wrongness, that I couldn’t say no to going out to try to do something.”

For most of her life, Ms. Muffett had positive interactions with law enforcement — until Sunday.

After she and her friends left the protest, Ms. Muffett had bruises on her stomach and knee from where one officer struck her with his bicycle, and another bruise on her arm after she fell back onto another protester.

“I’m sorry, this is the first time as a white lady I’ve gone through this,” Ms. Muffett said. “There’s a lot of privileged white women, and I’m one of them,” she said. “I’ve never had a cop treat me like that.”

“I’d never been affected by another one like this. I watched a man die, that’s why. I watched a man die.”

Erika Zdon, 48, Minneapolis

Minneapolis

“George Floyd, George Floyd,” rang the staccato chant from protesters ringing a memorial of flowers at the spot where Mr. Floyd died.

Erika Zdon had never joined a protest, but on Sunday, she drove her five children from Isanti, Minn., an hour away, so they could witness this moment.

“I said this could be in the history books and this could be something that changes the world,” Ms. Zdon said, “and you should smell it, and see it and hear it and feel what’s happening in our community.”

Ms. Zdon knew the violence of Mr. Floyd’s death was a difficult thing to share with her children, but their day-to-day life is full of white people. Before she and her family stood at the site where Mr. Floyd lost his life, she took them to a looted Target.

“I talked to the kids a lot about this is what hate is,” Ms. Zdon said. “This is what bound-up feelings look like.”

Kennetta Hollivay stood outside her store, the Dollar & Up market, a block-and-a-half from the spot where Mr. Floyd died.

She and her husband bought the store in September. It has been a rough few months. The store remained open through the pandemic but business was slow.

Ms. Hollivay has lived in the neighborhood her whole life, and said she felt compelled to join the protests, at first at least.

“When I first heard about it, I was like, ‘Oh, wow, the police have killed somebody else,’” Ms. Hollivay said. “And I was hurt. But once I saw video, it was like — that man died right before our eyes. I’ve never seen nothing like that before. Ever. Ever. I told my husband yesterday I’ve been having these dreams every night of this. Nightmares.”

Oakland, Calif.

Candice Elder runs an organization that has been trying to protect the homeless from the coronavirus. On Sunday, she pivoted to protecting protesters from clashes with the police. She distributed goggles, masks, first-aid supplies and milk of magnesia, which is diluted with water to ease the sting of tear gas.

Ms. Elder said she saw the death of Mr. Floyd in the context of the constant sting of racism in her work with homeless people. One quarter of Oakland’s population is black. Yet 70 percent of the homeless people are African-American.

An episode in April shook her up to the point of needing counseling. Two volunteers, both of them black, were on their way to meet with her when they were pulled from their car by police officers. The arrest, which took place in the parking lot of Ms. Elder’s nonprofit group, was captured on video. One of the workers was pinned to the ground next to his car, a scene that resembled the later arrest of Mr. Floyd.

The worker was taken to jail but released the next day. The police apologized, Ms. Elder said, saying it had been a case of mistaken identity.

“I’m tired of being sick and tired.”

Ben Willis grew up in a part of the city where he learned from a young age that African-Americans routinely experienced police harassment.

“I know what the police can do,” Mr. Willis said.

Those episodes helped propel him to the front lines of demonstrations in his hometown, where he has played a role in keeping protesters calm, focused and supported.

There are guidelines that Mr. Willis encourages fellow demonstrators to follow. Keep peaceful. Take steps not to hurt one another.

As a child, Sydney Driver’s family warned him to avoid white neighborhoods and the police. His aunt would tell him not to ride his bike over there because he and his friends would be beaten up — if not by residents, then by officers.

“We always had these restrictions since I was a little boy,” Mr. Driver said. “And now I’m married with four kids, and I don’t want to leave them in this world like it is when I go.”

On Sunday afternoon outside Barclays Center, he cheered and raised his fist in solidarity with the messages being yelled over a megaphone.

Mr. Driver said he felt the destruction of property and looting had been given outsized attention by people who refused to acknowledge that previous generations’ efforts to march peacefully against racism had never come close to succeeding.

“The police had dogs at your great-grandfather’s legs when he was trying to do it peacefully,” he said. “He got spit on.”

Mr. Driver said he and his wife had cried together watching the video of Mr. Floyd’s fatal encounter with the police. “If I have to die out here,” he said, he did not care. “I don’t. I just don’t.”

Liz Culley and her wife joined neighbors who protested at Pan Pacific Park.

“It was beautiful,” she said. “Some young kids gave me an extra sign because I didn’t have one.”

It was after she got home that much more chaotic protests moved onto her street. She coughed on the tear gas that reached her home as protesters sought refuge.

“I grabbed whatever I could — bottles of water and paper towels — and ran downstairs,” Ms. Culley said. “Other neighbors came out, it was all of us, the whole building as a unit. I was spraying people’s eyes, wiping their eyes, we had a little station set up.”

The street became a hot zone for several hours.

“People grabbed metal trash bins and barricaded the street so cops couldn’t drive through,” Ms. Culley said. “A girl came up with blood all over her face. We cleaned her up and told her she had to go to the hospital. ”

As the confrontations dissipated, other kinds of protesters moved in. “Opportunists,” she called them.

She felt disappointed. “There were people who wanted to be a part of a political statement, a movement, a march,” she said. “But burning the city, I don’t think that has anything to do with the people we interacted with yesterday. It’s just sad.”

Rashaad Dinkins, 18, Minneapolis

Rashaad Dinkins was 12 when unrest broke out in Ferguson. He remembers watching the news, knowing that black people were being killed.

“I just understood that my skin could get me in trouble, and I need to be careful about how I represent myself and how I act around certain groups,” Mr. Dinkins said.

When he worked at the Mall of America, a security guard followed him while he was on break. Mr. Dinkins became an actor and would become deflated when he sometimes was passed up for roles.

“Going into auditions and being told you weren’t good enough from a panel of white people, it was kind of demeaning and challenging,” Mr. Dinkins said. “That’s when I realized I have a voice and I have to speak up because I can’t feel like this anymore.”

When Mr. Floyd was killed just a few blocks from where Mr. Dinkins lives, he knew he had to be a part of the moment.

“I think it was the realization that it could have been me because I go to that store, and I grew up going to that store all the time,” Mr. Dinkins said. “It could have easily been my body under that police officer.”

Oakland, Calif.

Qiana Walker and her two daughters were finishing breakfast on Sunday morning when they decided they would scrap their plans for a hike, the beach and baby back ribs and instead join their first protest together.

To Ms. Walker, an out-of-work saleswoman who is having trouble paying her bills, the decision was not easy. She had not attended a protest in more than a decade, and never with her daughters, ages 16 and 22, largely because of the fear of what could happen if things turned violent.

“I can’t teach them fear,” she said through a black scarf, held over her mouth by a black hood pulled tight. “I have to teach them to fight, to stand up for yourself, to know to protect yourself.”

“What hit me about this in particular is how incredibly blatant it was, like how clear and how incredibly unnecessary and completely undefendable it was.”

Damarra Atkins, 31, Minneapolis

Minneapolis

Damarra Atkins, who is part black but was raised by her white mother in a predominantly white culture, said that the protests made her aware of her black identity more than ever.

“I think what hit me about this in particular is how incredibly blatant it was.”

She had been sitting alone, on the ground, on Sunday in front of the Fifth Police Precinct, waiting to speak to an official. Ms. Atkins, who works as an administrative assistant in a hospital and is trained in C.P.R., had helped set up a pop-up medical tent for injured protesters at a vacant parking lot. She was looking to negotiate with the police so that they could agree on who not to target during protests, including medical volunteers.

As National Guard troops and state patrols stormed the area, she said, the medical volunteers put their hands up and had visible signs identifying themselves.

Still, she said, they were pelted with flash grenades and rubber bullets.

“I suppose it could have been coincidental,” she said, “but it felt very coordinated and very tactical.”

She waited for an hour to speak to a police official about keeping medical volunteers safe. No one came. She eventually left.

Like the protesters, she had waited long enough.

How Did George Floyd Die? Here’s What We Know,"George Floyd, 46, died after being handcuffed on the street in the custody of the Minneapolis police on Memorial Day. An officer responding to a report that Mr. Floyd had tried to pass a fake $20 bill helped hold him down by lodging a knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes.

He died shortly after lapsing into unconsciousness.

But as protests continue to rage across the country demanding justice for Mr. Floyd, dueling narratives have emerged about the precise cause of his death. The criminal complaint supporting a murder charge for the officer, which referred to the Hennepin County medical examiner’s preliminary findings, said the autopsy had discounted traumatic asphyxia or strangulation as the cause of Mr. Floyd’s death.

But on Monday afternoon, the lawyers representing his family presented a very different version of how Mr. Floyd died. In their telling, three officers on the scene killed Mr. Floyd and should be held criminally responsible.

The private autopsy by doctors hired by Mr. Floyd’s family determined that he died not just because of the knee on his neck — held there by the officer, Derek Chauvin — but also because of two other officers who helped pin him down by applying pressure on his back. All three officers were fired last week, as was a fourth officer at the scene.

The cause of death, according to the private autopsy, was mechanical asphyxia and the manner of death was homicide.

Shortly after the family’s autopsy findings were announced, the Hennepin County medical examiner released its own findings, also concluding that the manner of death was homicide. The county attributed the cause of death to “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.”

In other words, Mr. Floyd’s heart stopped beating and his lungs stopped taking in air while he was being restrained by law enforcement. The one-page summary also noted that Mr. Floyd was intoxicated with fentanyl and had recently used methamphetamines.

The criminal complaint said that the autopsy “revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.” Mr. Floyd, the complaint said, had underlying health conditions, including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease.

A 10-minute cellphone video of the encounter showed Mr. Chauvin holding his knee on the back of Mr. Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. Mr. Floyd was unresponsive for nearly three minutes of the encounter after he repeatedly gasped, “I can’t breathe.”

The findings by the family’s private medical examiners directly contradict the report that there was no asphyxia, said Dr. Allecia M. Wilson, of the University of Michigan, one of the doctors who examined his body. The physical evidence showed that the pressure applied led to his death, she said. In an interview, Dr. Michael Baden, who also participated in the private autopsy, said there was also some hemorrhaging around the right carotid area.

Although she has not had access to the full medical examiner’s report, Dr. Wilson said: “We have seen accounts from the complaint and based on that, yes our findings do differ. Some of the information I read from that complaint states that there was no evidence of traumatic asphyxia. This is the point in which we do disagree. There is evidence in this case of mechanical or traumatic asphyxia.”

 She noted that she did not have access to toxicology results, tissue samples or some organs. Those items are not likely to change the results, she said.

The private doctors also said that any underlying conditions Mr. Floyd had did not kill him or contribute to his death.

“He was in good health,” Dr. Baden said.

The private autopsy concluded that even without evidence of “traumatic” asphyxia, such as broken bones, the compression caused by the officers still led to Mr. Floyd’s death by depriving his brain of blood and oxygen and his lungs of air.

But Dr. Baden acknowledged that the pressure was not necessarily visible in the autopsy because by the time any doctors reviewed the body, the pressure had been released. He added that abrasions on the left side of Mr. Floyd’s face and shoulder showed how hard he was pressed against the pavement.

“The video is real,” Dr. Baden said.

The doctors said the determination of cause and the manner of death were based on reviewing the circumstances, including the video, but also additional findings determined in their autopsy.

“We do have physical evidence that supports that there was pressure applied to his neck,” Dr. Wilson said.w

Dr. Baden added, “The main thing is that we both say it’s a homicide due to the way he was being subdued.”

Conducting the examination for the family were Dr. Wilson, director of autopsy and forensic services at the University of Michigan, and Dr. Baden, who was the chief medical examiner for New York City in the late 1970s. Dr. Baden is best known as host of the HBO television series “Autopsy.” He also did the private autopsy of Michael Brown, who was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014.

It is not unusual, he said, for autopsy reports to differ. “This is not necessarily science, it’s medicine. Medicine is an art and a science.”

Ben Crump, the lawyer representing the Floyd family, said Mr. Floyd’s death was the result of three officers who came into physical contact with him, compressing his neck and back.

Mr. Crump said Mr. Chauvin should be charged with first-degree murder rather than the lesser charge of third-degree murder he is facing, and that the other officers should face the “fullest extent of the law.”

He said that the family was distrusting of the Minneapolis Police Department based, in part, on the sanitized way it described how Mr. Floyd was detained, and that it was “encouraged” that Attorney General Keith Ellison of Minnesota was taking over the prosecution.

The day after Mr. Floyd’s death, the police statement described him as a suspected forger who “appeared to be under the influence,” who “physically resisted officers” and who appeared to be “suffering medical distress.” It never mentioned any officer’s role in his death.

Hours later, a graphic video emerged that showed a significantly different account.

Michigan Sheriff Took Off His Helmet and Marched With Protesters,"Sheriff Christopher R. Swanson of Genesee County in Michigan stood before a crowd of protesters on Saturday. They were outraged over the death last week of George Floyd in Minneapolis, police brutality and systemic racism.

“We want to be with you all for real,” Sheriff Swanson said, addressing the demonstrators who had gathered in Flint, Mich., according to footage from WEYI-TV.

He said he made it a point to take off his helmet and that officers had put down their batons. “I want to make this a parade, not a protest,” he said.

As the demonstrators applauded, he shook a protester’s hand and high-fived another. He then acknowledged the children in the crowd. Gesturing to the officers behind him, he asked the crowd what he and the other officers needed to do.

The crowd chanted: “Walk with us. Walk with us. Walk with us.”

And so he did.

Several hundred protesters marched from a Target store to the Flint Township Police station and remained peaceful during the protest, which lasted for several hours, the police said in a statement on Sunday.

“We are walking with you because all you’re asking for is a voice and dignity for all, no matter who you are,” Sheriff Swanson said in a speech after the march. “I love you guys. The police love you.”

Sheriff Swanson was among several law enforcement officials who in the past few days have engaged with marchers and shown solidarity either by marching, kneeling or publicly denouncing the death of Mr. Floyd.

Confrontations have escalated and cities, including Chicago, New York and Philadelphia, have seen violence and vandalism targeting the police in recent nights. Videos have shown police officers using batons, tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets on protesters, bystanders and journalists, often without warning.

At least five people have been killed so far in violence connected to the protests that started after Mr. Floyd died in police custody.

“I believe we saved lives last night,” Sheriff Swanson said at a news conference on Sunday. He could not be immediately reached for comment.

Quajuan Adams, one of the protesters, also spoke at the news conference. He said the protest was not just about the George Floyds and the Eric Garners of the world — it was about everyone.

“All the police forces need to make sure they are doing things the right way,” he said. “They need to focus on the training, policies, what is considered being combative, what is not being combative and what forces need to be taken in certain situations.”

Sheriff Swanson said people of all ages and backgrounds came from as far as Detroit and Indiana to voice their frustrations about what happened in Minneapolis. But that episode, he said, was not a reflection on all of the 800,000 police officers in the country.

“We became the beacon of light last night, and so we are calling for a national night of peace,” he said. “It starts from law enforcement: Lay down your swords.”

Over 1,000 people have been fatally shot by the police in the past year, according to The Washington Post.

Around the country, law enforcement officials have joined demonstrators protesting police brutality and the death of Mr. Floyd.

In Camden, N.J., a police chief carried a banner and led a peaceful march. In Schenectady, N.Y., police officers marched with protesters through the city’s downtown area. And in Santa Cruz, Calif., police officers knelt with hundreds of protesters to honor Mr. Floyd and bring attention to police violence against black people.

In New York City, officers took a knee in Queens and in Times Square as crowds cheered.

And in Houston, where Mr. Floyd grew up, the police chief denounced police brutality in an emotional speech.

The chief, Art Acevedo, has marched with demonstrators and has called for charges to be filed against the four officers in Minneapolis who were involved in taking Mr. Floyd into custody.

Chief Acevedo took off his mask at one point on Sunday during a Pull Up and Praise event, an outdoor religious service where people worship from their cars. He pumped his arm as those assembled in their vehicles honked their horns in support.

“We have a man, a son, a brother, an uncle, a cousin, a Houstonian, a child of God that was killed by servants that are supposed to be servants of God, and they showed no mercy when they put their knee on his neck,” he said of Mr. Floyd.

Protests Near White House Spiral Out of Control Again,"WASHINGTON — Despite an 11 p.m. curfew imposed by Mayor Muriel E. Bowser and the activation of the National Guard, protests near the White House fueled by anger over the police killing of George Floyd spiraled out of control again on Sunday night.

Demonstrators were hit in the head with canisters of tear gas. Some protesters broke into offices. Others started fires, one of which may have spread to the basement of St. John’s, the Episcopal church that has been attended at least once by every chief executive going back to James Madison. Firefighters soon put out the flames.

Hundreds of people surged in front of the White House for a third straight night. At 8 p.m., troops could be seen marching across the South Lawn as President Trump sat inside, tweeting about law and order.

The protesters reclaimed a slice of Lafayette Square that had been the dividing line with the police on Saturday night. As they got closer to the White House, teenagers covered a park bathroom structure in graffiti like “AMERIKKKA” and climbed atop for a better view. The police periodically lobbed tear gas into the crowd and announced over a megaphone their intent to push the protesters back. But as night fell, they had yet to succeed.

But as the evening continued, the demonstrations turned into a repeat of the previous night. The police reclaimed ground in the park, and the crowds retreated to H Street. There, they started a giant bonfire in front of St. John’s Church. The bathroom structure in the park was also set ablaze. On I Street, a car burned.

Sunday began with workers scrambling to secure businesses in the heart of the nation’s capital, ahead of what many feared may be another night of fury over Mr. Floyd’s killing.

“I was called at two o’clock in the morning and again this morning,” said Bryant Woltz, a glass contractor boarding up the Bombay Club, ordinarily the scene of power lunches between politicians and the media elite. “They said we need all hands on deck; this is an emergency.”

Across from the Bombay Club, another restaurant, the Oval Room, was graffitied with “THE RICH AREN’T SAFE ANYMORE!” Nearby at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce building, which had been set on fire and had its windows smashed, Bill Voge, 35, was hastily slapping gray paint over more graffiti. “We’re trying to recover as best we can from what transpired last night and then tonight it’s supposed to be the same thing, so we’ll probably be back tomorrow, doing the same thing,” he said, paint roller in hand.

The Saturday protests had begun peacefully at 2 p.m., opposite the Justice Department. “We want charges,” an organizer shouted into a megaphone. “We want convictions. No more acquittals. We want these people to be held accountable.” Protesters marched down to the National Mall, snaked around the Reflecting Pool and came to a stop at the statue of Ulysses S. Grant on horseback. There, with the Capitol building in the background, they chanted “George Floyd!” and the names of other victims of police brutality, including Breonna Taylor and Philando Castile.

“We built this country, and it’s time for people to respect us,” said Pamela Alston, 31, an insurance underwriter from Southeast Washington. Jarrell Slade, 26, a school counselor and Washington native, said: “I’m fed up. I’m tired of going on social media, talking to my friends and family, and having everything be centered on black death.”

Malik Harris, 23, a global studies major at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, rented a house in Washington with friends for the weekend to join the protest. “I’m supposed to be doing my homework right now for the summer semester,” he said. “But I definitely want to be present for everything.”

Later in the afternoon, crowds swelled on H Street near the White House and then took off through the streets. They marched past the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, blaring N.W.A. They enveloped traffic on Constitution Avenue. Every car honked in solidarity. Marco Silva, 28, was driving a “College Hunks” moving service truck when he was swarmed. But he was not bothered. Hopping out to light a cigarette and pump his fist in the air, he said: “I think this is beautiful. What everybody is doing right now is a beautiful thing.”

A significant portion of the demonstrators were white, and they joined with the largely African-American crowd to protest police aggression. Cameron McCall, 23, a self-described social media influencer, helped organize the protest, with an emphasis on peace, and said: “We’ve seen that we have a strong voice on social media with our generation, and look at us now, united, walking, and off our phones. Beyond shoes and clothes and celebrities, we are doing it for a purpose.”

As the day progressed, marchers knelt near the National Museum of African American History and Culture for nine minutes of silence, around the time that Officer Derek Chauvin’s knee was on Mr. Floyd’s neck in Minneapolis. As they moved on past the World War II Memorial, they urged tourists to join them. The sun began to dip as they rested at the Lincoln Memorial.

Mr. Trump, who returned to the White House on Saturday evening after a day at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, had suggested in a tweet that Saturday would be “MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE” and that his supporters might turn out in their red “Make America Great Again” caps. But there were no red caps to be seen among a sea of hundreds flooding H Street.

By 9 p.m., tensions between the police and a growing crowd of protesters broke out, with demonstrators wresting the barricades from the police, who in turn volleyed canisters of tear gas into the crowd.

“Water with baking soda helps,” said Azzah Davis, 19, who was kneeling in a nearby alley trying to recover from the gas. “We were protesting, I don’t want to say peacefully, because things were getting out of control, and the cops were shooting people with rubber bullets. They started throwing mace and people picked it up and threw it back.” She added: “It’s very long overdue. We have been peaceful long enough.”

A flaming dumpster illuminated the police as some demonstrators hurled bricks and other projectiles their way. Despite the pandemic, many people in the crowd had no choice but to discard their masks to cough and sneeze as the acrid tang of tear gas whipped up and down the block.

Sarah Cooper, a 27-year-old accountant, was holding a sign that mentioned Covid-19. “It’s a systemic issue. Black people are more likely to die from Covid-19,” she said. After three hours in front of the White House, she added, “it’s kind of disorganized, but I think it’s nice that people are still coming out to push for change.”

By 11 p.m., a Chevy Suburban on I Street was in flames and the crowds fanned out, smashing windows and trying to wreck as much as they could.

By 5 p.m. Sunday, there were already hundreds of people protesting outside the White House."
"Facing Protests Over Use of Force, Police Respond With More Force","[Follow our live updates on the George Floyd protests across the country.]

Demonstrations continued across the United States on Sunday as the nation braced for another grueling night of unrest over police shootings and the death of George Floyd, amid growing concern that aggressive law enforcement tactics intended to impose order were instead inflaming tensions.

Videos showed police officers in recent nights using batons, tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets on protesters, bystanders and journalists, often without warning or seemingly unprovoked. The footage, which has been shared widely online, highlighted the very complaints over police behavior that have drawn protests in at least 75 cities across the United States.

In Salt Lake City, officers in riot gear shoved a man with a cane to the ground.

In Brooklyn, two police S.U.V.s plowed into a crowd of protesters.

In Atlanta, police officers enforcing a curfew stopped two college students in a car, fired Tasers on them and dragged them out of the vehicle.

And in Minneapolis, where there have been six consecutive nights of protests and clashes, a video appeared to show officers yelling at people on their porches to get inside and then firing paint canisters at them. “Light them up,” one officer said.

[See photos from a sixth night of protest in cities across America.]

As crowds began gathering again in cities on Sunday, President Trump resisted calls to address the tensions roiling the country. Instead he used Twitter to criticize local Democratic leaders for not doing more to control the protests.

Mayors and police chiefs spent the day explaining, defending and promising full investigations into the actions of officers seen on the disturbing videos.

“I didn’t like what I saw one bit. I did not want to ever see something like that,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, who also complimented the city’s police officers for generally showing a “tremendous amount of restraint.”

Military vehicles in recent nights have moved down city streets as phalanxes of officers in full riot gear fired clouds of noxious gas. Yet the show of force showed little sign that it would bring calm.

Instead, some people said, it was escalating tensions and serving as a reminder of the regular use of military equipment and tactics by local police forces. 

Mass demonstrations are among the most difficult situations that the police have to manage. They must balance constitutional liberties with the safety of officers and the public. Crowds are unpredictable and, in recent days, sometimes hostile. Too much force can escalate the situation — but so can too little.

Not all protests have erupted in violence, with some police forces showing a more positive relationship with their communities. In Petersburg, Va., Chief Kenneth Miller and a handful of police officers appeared alongside protesters to show solidarity. In Newark, a city where half the population is black, protests were angry but nonviolent.

And in Oklahoma City on Sunday, as a crowd of marchers seemed to grow tense, officers with the sheriff’s department’s tactical team took a knee in a pose popularized by the former N.F.L. quarterback Colin Kaepernick. The protesters cheered.

In other places, there was open hostility, with chaotic scenes and constant videotaping among protesters increasing the scrutiny on the tactics used by the police.

In Seattle, a video taken on Friday showed officers detaining someone on the ground and repeatedly punching the person.

Dae Shik Kim Jr., who was in the area and shared the video on behalf of a friend who wanted to remain anonymous, said it was just one in a series of tactics that troubled him during the protests.

“The tone that we felt from the police is: This is their rally,” Mr. Kim said. “They are going to control it from the beginning. They are going to dictate what happens. It’s a very offensive type of approach.”

In one arrest, captured on video after a group of people had gone into a damaged retail store, one officer put a knee on the back of the arrestee’s neck. Mr. Floyd, the man whose death on May 25 inspired protests in Minneapolis that have spread across the country, died after an officer kept his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for close to nine minutes.

As onlookers in Seattle shouted at the officer to remove his knee, his partner reached over and pulled it away.

The Seattle Police Department has said that officers that day took action after being assaulted with rocks, bottles and other projectiles, and that all uses of force would undergo a high level of scrutiny.

Chief Erika Shields of the Atlanta Police Department condemned the actions of the officers who fired upon the college students with a Taser, saying the episode had only underscored the fear and wariness that people of color have of the police. The officers involved were fired.

“I know that we caused further fear to you in a space that’s already so fearful for so many African-Americans, and I am genuinely sorry,” Chief Shields said in a news conference on Sunday. “This is not who we are. This is not what we’re about.”

In Minneapolis, businesses have been burned and looted and the National Guard has been called in to help restore order. But a member of the City Council, Jeremiah Ellison, summed up the situation this way: The police started it.

“No one was looting anything in the first night of this protest, no one was lighting anything on fire on the first night of this protest, and yet the response from the police was incredibly brutal,” he said. “The original provocation to street violence was from our officers.”

On the day after Mr. Floyd died, Mr. Ellison gathered with others at the site where Mr. Floyd was detained and walked with them to a nearby police precinct, he said. The crowd was relatively peaceful, he said, but the officers sprayed tear gas. Once the marchers reached the precinct, tensions grew, but in Mr. Ellison’s view the police overreacted.

“One of the city’s employees has just murdered someone in the most brutal fashion,” he said, “and for you to then pretend like you’re the victim and you’re under siege, to fire mace and tear gas and rubber bullets in response to water bottles being thrown — you have at that point 100 percent antagonized the situation.”

Mr. Ellison said the decision could have been made at that point to allow the precinct to be vandalized — a practice known as “negotiated management,” allowing some illegal activity like blocking a highway or damaging property in order to prevent worse events like arson or physical attacks.

Instead, when the police abandoned the precinct two days later, allowing protesters to set it afire, it was too late, Mr. Ellison said: “What could have been a strategic containment of destruction on Day 1 became a victory on the battlefield by Day 3.”

Many people complained that police officers across the country treated the crowds protesting racist policing with far less respect than they did the right-wing demonstrations in recent weeks against public health lockdown orders.

Experts agreed, saying research shows that the police are more likely to respond with force when they are the subject of protest, and that they respond more aggressively toward younger crowds and people of color than they do toward white and older people.

“There’s deep resentment on the part of the police that so many people are angry at them, and they’re lashing out,” said Alex Vitale, a sociologist at Brooklyn College who studies the police response to protest and coordinates the Policing and Social Justice Project. “Look at what we saw — people sitting on their own stoops getting hit with pepper balls. Anyone who looks at them funny, they’re attacking them.”

Paul Schnell, the Minnesota Department of Corrections commissioner, who was assisting in the official response, later apologized for that incident, which actually involved paint canisters. “We do not want there to be collateral harm,” he said.

In many places, the police defended their tactics as necessary to deter crime. In Dallas, Chief U. Reneé Hall said pepper spray and tear gas were needed to disperse demonstrators who were vandalizing property. “We will not tolerate tearing up our cities, our communities,” she said, according to The Dallas Morning News.

But critics said the protest was “a simple march” and the response was unwarranted.

The militarization of the nation’s police departments in recent decades has been on full display. But such equipment and training, including armored personnel carriers and SWAT team training, have been heavily criticized for warping the relationship between the police and the communities they serve.

Jennifer Cobbina, a criminal justice professor at Michigan State University, has researched the response to the protests in Ferguson, Mo., after the death of Michael Brown at the hands of the police in 2014, and in Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray in 2015.

In Baltimore, she said, the police gave people more space to protest for longer before cracking down on unrest, resulting in a more favorable view of the police and a better understanding of the challenges they face. But Ferguson, where the unrest refused to die down, was heavily militarized.

“It makes a lot of the residents feel like the police are coming in as an occupying force,” she said. “This only creates a greater divide. The harder the state comes at them, the harder they’ll come back.”

Two Crises Convulse a Nation: A Pandemic and Police Violence,"They are parallel plagues ravaging America: The coronavirus. And police killings of black men and women.

Jimmy Mills’s life has been upended by both. His barbershop in Midtown Minneapolis was one of many small, black-owned businesses that have struggled to survive the pandemic. But Mr. Mills was hopeful because, after two months shut down, he was due to reopen next week.

Then early on Friday, the working-class neighborhood where Mr. Mills has cut hair for 12 years went up in flames as chaotic protests over the death of George Floyd and police killings of African-Americans engulfed Minneapolis and cities across the country.

“To have corona, and then this — it’s like a gut shot,” Mr. Mills, 56, said.

The upheaval sparked by a video capturing Mr. Floyd’s agonizing last minutes as a white police officer kneels on his neck is pulsing through an America already ragged with anger and anxiety. Emotions are raw over the toll of a pandemic that has killed more than 100,000 people across the country and cost millions of jobs. On Sunday, at least another 600 Americans were reported to have died from Covid-19.

Minneapolis residents said outrage and protests in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd were a result of a community being tested repeatedly in recent weeks by both police violence and the virus — and in ways that put America’s deep racial inequalities in stark relief.

The outbreak has inflicted disproportionate economic and health tolls on racial minorities and immigrants in Minneapolis and beyond. Black and Latino workers have been more likely to have lost their jobs. Many others are among the low-paid hourly workers who risk their health by going to work at grocery stores, nursing homes, factories, slaughterhouses and other jobs that cannot be done remotely.

The black community in Minnesota has also been hit hard by cases of the virus, just as African-Americans across the country are being infected and dying at higher rates.

By one estimate, black people accounted for at least 29 percent of known Covid-19 cases in Minnesota, despite making up about 6 percent of the state’s population. African-Americans make up 35 percent of coronavirus cases in Minneapolis, though they are less than 20 percent of the city’s population.

“There are no words to describe what people are going through,” said State Representative Mohamud Noor, who represents a district with many Somalis and other immigrants. His great-uncle died of the coronavirus a few days ago, and Mr. Noor said he is losing track of how many other relatives and constituents are dying.

Scenes from the protests over racism and police violence that have erupted across the country.

Mr. Noor said the school closures had hurt poorer students without laptops or reliable internet access to take classes online, and that waves of job losses had sent local unemployment rates soaring. Now, with more than 200 businesses damaged or destroyed in the unrest, Mr. Noor said he was worried about new waves of foreclosures, job losses and business failures.

“Many people who are poor who didn’t have much, this devastation will really impact them,” Mr. Noor said.

Even before the pandemic, the Midtown neighborhood, where buildings were burned, damaged and looted, had been trying to rebuild itself after years of economic hardship. The area is in a historically segregated part of town where some residents had felt neglected. A railway was repurposed into a bike and walking trail that runs through the neighborhood. The Midtown Global Market had sprung up, attracting diners and shoppers to its Hmong, Indian, Moroccan and other international food and crafts.

But now, next door to Mr. Mills, the barber, a dollar store and beauty-supply shop have been burned to rubble. The front windows of Mr. Mills’s barbershop were smashed, and looters stole his televisions, video equipment and his clippers.

Now, with the power out, water seeping across the floor and phalanxes of police officers and National Guard troops blockading his neighborhood, he does not know when his J-Klips barbershop might reopen.

“Half of the place is condemned,” he said. “Where do we go from here?”

Phillipe Cunningham, a City Council member, represents a poor ward in northern Minneapolis with a large black, Hmong and Native American population. He said had spent the past two months fighting to get a coronavirus testing site opened and fielding calls from laid-off workers falling behind on rent and black business owners unable to navigate the maze of federal relief programs.

On Friday, Mr. Cunningham drove around surveying damaged buildings, helping some of the same business owners board up their storefronts and trying to prevent looters from breaking into stores.

“We were already struggling,” Mr. Cunningham said.

In many pockets of the city where the virus seemed to be more concentrated, residents have not had access to masks and hand sanitizer, even as the mayor ordered masks be worn when inside businesses as of earlier this week, said Jia Starr Brown, pastor of First Covenant Church in downtown Minneapolis.

Even healthy people in Minneapolis were feeling anxious after a long stretch of being holed up in their homes as spring arrived; a limited reopening of businesses was not set to begin until Monday. That loosening of restrictions came with a long list of social-distancing and sanitation rules.

Ms. Brown spoke as she stepped away from a protest outside a county building Friday afternoon, saying she was heartened to see so many people attend rallies calling for justice for Mr. Floyd, even when doing so was a health risk.

“This is about collective widespread grief, and how great must the grief be that people would risk their livelihoods?” she said. “Who we are as a people is greater than the risk to be out there. This is urgent. This isn’t about just our own individual lives as black people, but this is about our futures and children.”

Many young people, especially minorities, were gig-economy workers holding two or three part-time jobs that evaporated when the outbreak hit, said Tyler Sit, pastor of the New City Church, which is blocks away from where Mr. Floyd died and from the Third Precinct that was burned in the protests. They were left jobless and worried about not having benefits should they become ill.

Sitting at home during lockdown, with no work and no prospect of finding work for the foreseeable future, he said, they were more aware than usual of news reports and then had the time to react by taking to the streets.

“I hear messages from community members trying to deliberate whether or not they’re going to show up. They don’t want to catch Covid-19 and spread Covid-19 if they happen to be an asymptomatic carrier,” he said. “But there’s a deep feeling of we have to do something because our city is burning.”

In Atlanta, Denver, New York and beyond, protesters have also emerged despite the pandemic. They have slipped on face masks and bandannas to guard against the coronavirus, as well as tear gas.

Anais Nunez, a 31-year-old community organizer from the Allerton neighborhood of the Bronx, said she braved the risk of coming to a crowded protest to show solidarity with others marching against police violence.

“I’m from the Bronx, the epicenter of the epicenter,” she said about the borough that has the city’s highest rates of cases, hospitalizations and deaths from the coronavirus. “We’re already suffering. Having to do all of this, it makes the terrible even worse.”

Rashawn Ray, a sociologist and fellow at the Brookings Institution, said one crucial difference between the two plagues is that the coronavirus, like past diseases, may one day dissipate with a vaccine or medical breakthrough. “We’ve never gotten to a place where racism is not a significant part of everyone’s life in the United States,” he said.

Cities on Edge as Fires Burn Near White House,"

The police fired tear gas near the White House on Sunday night to dissuade protesters who had smashed the windows of prominent buildings, overturned cars and set fires, with smoke seen rising from near the Washington Monument.

The White House went dark, turning off almost all of its external lights, as protesters seethed in dozens of cities, again defying curfews to demonstrate against police brutality following the death of George Floyd in police custody.

It was the sixth day of nationwide unrest since the death of Mr. Floyd last week in Minneapolis. Mayors imposed curfews and several governors mobilized the National Guard, but that did not quell widespread protests in cities across the country, some of them marked by violence and looting.

Protests have erupted in at least 140 cities across the United States in the days after George Floyd, a black man, died in police custody. Some of the demonstrations have turned violent, prompting the activation of the National Guard in at least 21 states.

Data as of May 31.

In Birmingham, Ala., protesters started to tear down a Confederate monument that the city had previously covered with a tarp amid a lawsuit between the state attorney general and the city.

In Boston, a police S.U.V. was set ablaze near the State House, sending up a column of black smoke after a large group of protesters had mostly dispersed.

In Philadelphia, police officers in riot gear and an armored vehicle used pepper spray to try to repel rioters and looters. A wall of officers blocked an entrance ramp to Interstate 676 in the city, where the mass transit system suspended service starting at 6 p.m. as part of a citywide curfew.

In New York, demonstrators marched across the Brooklyn and Williamsburg Bridges, snarling traffic. The Manhattan Bridge was briefly shut down to car traffic. Chaos erupted in Union Square at around 10 p.m., with flames leaping up two stories from trash cans and piles of street debris. The night before in Union Square, the mayor’s daughter, Chiara de Blasio, 25, was among the protesters arrested, according to a police official.

In Chicago, the police superintendent, David Brown, excoriated the looters on Sunday as Gov. J.B. Pritzker activated the National Guard at the city’s request.

In Louisville, Ky., a tense confrontation in the middle of a crowded street was partially defused when a black woman stepped forward and offered a policeman in riot gear a hug. They embraced for nearly a minute.

Peter Baker in Washington

Tonight the city police widened the perimeter, blocking streets streets as far as a mile away from the White House while police in riot gear confronted protesters in the north section of Lafayette Square.

Hundreds of protesters remained from earlier demonstrations in the day, surging and chanting and pushing against the line of police, then falling back. Some threw water bottles, set off fireworks and torched at least one vehicle.

Soon after St. John’s Church, the so-called “church of presidents” where every chief executive going back to James Madison has worshiped, erupted in flames in the basement.

Businesses nearby boarded up after damage from the night before, including the iconic Hay Adams Hotel and the Oval Room restaurant. Businesses far away from the White House boarded up to protect themselves as well. Helicopters hovered overhead.

Close to downtown, a few hundred protesters peacefully marched through the streets, chanting and carrying signs.

Behind the diverse crowd, Donavon Butler, 33, drove a white minivan with his wife and four children inside. His 5-year-old son, Chase, hung out the back window with his right fist raised and his left hand holding a cardboard sign that said “Mama! I can’t breath. Don’t shoot.”

“The world we live in is not equal. People look at us different,” Mr. Butler said he told his son.

About a two-mile walk from the Third Precinct police station that protesters stormed on Thursday night is Sanford Middle School. The pandemic had closed the school since March, but students were still able to receive school lunches. Now, the unrest has made the building inaccessible and shops and supermarkets shuttered, leaving hundreds of the school’s students potentially without food.

Volunteers and school staff jumped into action to start a food drive. Donations included loaves of bread, apples, carrots, rice and beans.

“It is like viral beyond all comprehension,” said Amy Nelson, the school principal. Donations started at 10 a.m. and within a few hours, she said, there was enough food to fill several trailer trucks.

Richard Fausset in Atlanta

The demonstrators stopped, hundreds of them, black and white, and they sat. A self-appointed leader among them, an entrepreneur named John Wade, praised them for their nonviolence. But he warned them not to keep marching up the hill. The cops were up there fighting it out, he said, with “the non-compliant people.”

The organizers told everyone to turn off Centennial Olympic Park Drive, and veer away from the trouble. A police officer told them not to walk forward.

Then the tear gas started.

People chanted the way they do at Atlanta ball games, riffing on the old song “Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye.”

“We ready, we ready, we ready for y’all,” they sang.

Jack Healy in Denver

Two Atlanta police officers were fired on Sunday, one day after videos emerged showing them using stun guns on two black college students and then dragging them out of their car.

Atlanta’s mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, announced the dismissal of the two officers, whom she did not name, during a news conference on Sunday. She said their actions had constituted “excessive force.”

Ms. Bottoms said three other officers who were involved in the arrests had been reassigned to desk duty while the department reviews their actions.

“It was disturbing on many levels, the least of not which was that there clearly was an excessive use of force,” Ms. Bottoms said. “We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress, but we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable.”

Ms. Bottoms said she had reviewed police body camera footage of the confrontation and that it should be released immediately. The episode was broadcast live on local television on Saturday night, showing a group of officers stopping a man and woman in their car near downtown Atlanta roughly 45 minutes after a curfew went into effect at 9 p.m. It was unclear what prompted the police to stop the car.

The actions of the Atlanta officers came amid intensifying scrutiny of how law enforcement was responding to demonstrators.

Chief Erika Shields of the Atlanta Police Department condemned the actions of the officers, saying that the two students had been “manhandled” and that the episode had only underscored the fear and wariness minorities have of the police.

“I am genuinely sorry,” Chief Shields said. “This is not who we are. This is not what we’re about.”

“We are having peaceful speeches, we have a reverend —” Protesters gathered outside in Minneapolis on Saturday, for the fifth day in a row. This group was demonstrating outside the city’s Fifth Police Precinct. “I can’t stand the fact that some people in our society can’t walk around without feeling scared that a cop is not going to come to them with a death sentence.” Just after 8 p.m., police came out to enforce the city’s curfew. “You are in violation of Minneapolis city curfew ordinance.” They began firing pepper spray and tear gas to disperse the group. [screams] “I swear to God! I swear to [expletive] God —” Protesters here told us why they were out on the streets. “Honestly, the world is watching the United States, and more specifically Minneapolis itself, to see how we’re going to react and get justice for Mr. Floyd. And for me, being out here is a huge thing.” “The Minneapolis Police Department is notorious for their racism here. Black men are about 13 times more likely to be killed by cops than white men in the city. And I think that people just finally had enough.” “They tortured him, right? What else is there to do but get their attention?” Since George Floyd’s death, peaceful protests have mixed with looting and rioting at night. Most protesters we spoke with oppose the violence, but many said they understood the frustration and anger people are feeling. “No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace!” “We are here for justice for George. We’re sick and tired of being abused and oppressed by the police. They’ve been doing that [expletive] for years and years.” “Man, we’ve got to come together as a people, as a one. This racism’s been going on for too long.” “All four hundred years or more.” “Too long.” “All this [expletive] can be replaced. The body cannot be replaced.” “The body can never be replaced.” “I don’t want to see businesses burned down. But, I mean, we’re in kind of a war zone out here. And so, that’s kind of, I think, the least of our worries in a lot of ways.” “Bring him, bring him, bring him one block. Bring him one block to a medic.” “What happened? Someone hit him with a bat?” “You’ve got to calm down. We’re on the same team.” “You’ve got to calm down.” “Calm down — what happened, what happened? We’ve got about 12 medics here. We’re going to do the best we can. We’ve got a combat medic here, OK? But we’ve got to dial it down —” “We’ve got to keep it down.” “— because they’re looking for any reason to kill us.” One protester described the violence that broke out after she confronted a group of rioters in the neighborhood. “There was a group of guys who started screaming at the police, throwing things. I asked them, ‘Who are you? Who are you to come in here and do this?’ They ran up on me with big steel pipes. They got in my face. And one guy came at me, holding the pipe, and he stepped in, and he took it.” “You’re going to be all right —” “What message are we sending by destroying what is ours? How does that, how does that get the message out about how we need change in our city if all we’re doing is destroying it and burning it down?”

The most jolting scenes of violence late Sunday appeared to take place in Manhattan, where chaos erupted in Union Square at around 10 p.m. Flames nearly two stories high leapt from trash cans and piles of street debris in the neighborhood, sending acrid smoke into the air.

Protesters threw bottles and other objects at police officers armed with batons who pushed into crowds on Broadway and nearby side streets. As flames spread across one downtown street, officers ordered protesters to disperse. In SoHo, looters smashed windows and stole merchandise from upscale stores.

Around 11 p.m., hundreds of protesters faced off against the police near the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Overhead, a police helicopter monitored the scene.

Police vehicles raced to the area as water bottles and other objects rained down on officers. Peaceful protesters fled the area as tension rose, but others moved closer to the police, who quickly swept demonstrators out of the area.

A tanker truck barreled through thousands of protesters in Minneapolis on Sunday afternoon, coming to a stop as the crowd parted to avoid getting hit.

The Minnesota Department of Public Safety said that no one had been struck by the truck, although some protesters told local media that they had seen people with injuries. The police said the driver was “inciting” the peaceful protesters, and that he had been arrested and treated at a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries.

As the tanker truck came to a stop, demonstrators who had just sprinted from its path swarmed back toward it and pulled the driver out of the cab, according to videos from the scene. As people ran toward the driver, several protesters shouted for them to not hurt him and tried to create a buffer zone.

The confrontation took place on Interstate 35, which had been partly closed to traffic because of the protest, and the police said they were working with transportation officials to determine how the truck had gotten onto the highway.

“I don’t know the motives of the driver at this time, but at this point in time, to not have tragedy and many deaths is simply an amazing thing,” Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota said at a news conference. He called video of the episode “horrifying.”

The protest had been peaceful and well organized; the Department of Public Safety had tweeted updates about the group’s location and said its officers were working to keep the demonstrators safe.

A combative President Trump on Sunday berated Democrats for not being tough enough on violent protesters and attributed the turmoil roiling the nation to radical leftists.

Spurning advice from some campaign advisers to deliver a nationally televised address, Mr. Trump instead spent Sunday out of sight.

But he kept on tweeting.

“Get tough Democrat Mayors and Governors,” he wrote. Addressing his presumptive Democratic presidential opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., he added: “These people are ANARCHISTS. Call in our National Guard NOW. The World is watching and laughing at you and Sleepy Joe. Is this what America wants? NO!!!”

The president also said his administration “will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,” employing a shorthand for “anti-fascist.” But antifa is a movement of activists who dress in black and call themselves anarchists, not an organization with a clear structure that can be penalized under law. Moreover, American law applies terrorist designations to foreign entities, not domestic groups.

While Mr. Trump has been a focus of anger, particularly in the crowds in Washington, aides repeatedly have tried to explain to him that the protests were not only about him, but about broader, systemic issues related to race. Privately, Mr. Trump’s advisers complained about his tweets, acknowledging that they were pouring fuel on an already incendiary situation.

“Those are not constructive tweets, without any question,” Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the Senate, said in an interview on “Fox News Sunday.”

Mass protests that have brought thousands of people out of their homes and onto the streets in cities across America are raising the specter of new coronavirus outbreaks, prompting political leaders, physicians and public health experts to warn that the crowds could cause a surge in cases.

More than 100,000 Americans have already died of Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. People of color have been particularly hard hit, with rates of hospitalizations and deaths among black Americans far exceeding those of whites.

While many political leaders affirmed the right of protesters to express themselves, they urged the demonstrators to wear face masks and maintain social distancing, both to protect themselves and to prevent further community spread of the virus.

The protests are occurring as many states have warily begun reopening after weeks of stay-at-home orders.

In Los Angeles, where demonstrations led to the closing of virus testing sites on Saturday, Mayor Eric Garcetti warned that the protests could become so-called “super-spreader events” that can lead to an explosion of secondary infections. And Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a Republican, expressed concern that his state would see a spike in cases in about two weeks, which is about how long it takes for symptoms to emerge after someone is infected.

Some infectious disease experts were reassured by the fact that the protests were held outdoors, saying the open-air settings could mitigate the risk of transmission. In addition, many of the demonstrators were wearing masks.

As President Trump painted the National Guard as key to restoring order and taunted Democratic governors and mayors for not calling out the troops, the generals in charge of troops in three states said on Sunday afternoon that they had been only in support roles and had not used any force to put down the civil unrest.

The leaders of the Minnesota, Georgia and Colorado National Guards made clear that while troops had probably had a deterrent effect, the bulk of the credit for containing the violence went to local police officers. National Guard forces have been used mostly to secure buildings, allowing more police officers to move to the front lines, they said.

“Our purpose is to allow our local law enforcement professionals to do their jobs,” said Gen. Jon Jensen, the leader of Minnesota’s National Guard. “We do that by relieving them of items like infrastructure security.”

The forces in Minnesota and Georgia are armed, but the Colorado troops have only nonlethal weaponry. The generals did not describe under what conditions they would use force, only that they would be proportional and used in self-defense.

General Jensen said he had requested additional military police battalions from the National Guard forces of neighboring states, but said he would not recommend that the Minnesota governor request regular Army forces for that job, as Mr. Trump has offered.

Army Maj. Gen. Thomas Carden Jr., the adjutant general of the Georgia National Guard, expressed dismay that his forces had to be called out for a domestic civil unrest mission.

“We in America should not get used to or accept uniformed service members of any variety having to be put in a position where they are having to secure people inside the United States of America,” General Carden said. “While we are honored to do it, this is a sign of the times that we have to do better as a country.”

Say his name! George Floyd! Say his name! George Floyd! Stop killing us! George Floyd! No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace! Black lives matter! Black lives matter! George Floyd! George Floyd! Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter!

Hundreds of protesters gathered in Trafalgar Square in central London on Sunday afternoon and marched toward the United States Embassy, the most visible sign of popular support overseas for the protests across the United States against police killings of black people. Protests also took place in Germany and Denmark.

Holding signs and clapping their hands, the protesters in England gathered in Trafalgar Square in defiance of stay-at-home restrictions in effect across Britain to fight the coronavirus pandemic. They chanted “I can’t breathe,” “Black lives matter” and “No justice, no peace” before crossing the River Thames to march peacefully to the embassy.

The protest march on Sunday echoed one on Saturday in the Peckham district of South London and another one on Sunday outside the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen. Another London march is planned for next Sunday.

Several hundred protesters also rallied outside the U.S. Embassy in Berlin on Sunday, holding up signs saying “Justice for George Floyd” and “Stop killing us,” Reuters reported.

In Germany’s top soccer league, two players — the English forward Jadon Sancho and the French striker Marcus Thuram — made references to the killing of George Floyd as part of goal celebrations during matches on Sunday.

As cities and states brace for more demonstrations in the coming days, the authorities have responded by calling in more resources and readjusting previously held plans.

In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott declared a state of disaster on Sunday, an action that enables him to designate federal agents to serve as Texas peace officers. The Republican governor, who activated the Texas National Guard a day earlier, issued the disaster order after protests in the state’s major cities touched off confrontations between demonstrators and law enforcement.

“As protests have turned violent in various areas across the state, it is crucial that we maintain order, uphold public safety, and protect against property damage or loss,” Mr. Abbott said in announcing the disaster declaration. “Every Texan and every American has the right to protest and I encourage all Texans to exercise their First Amendment rights,” he said. “However, violence against others and the destruction of property is unacceptable and counterproductive.”

And in South Florida, Mayor Carlos Gimenez of Miami-Dade County postponed the planned reopening of beaches following the lockdown because of the pandemic. Miami-Dade beaches had been scheduled to open on Monday.

“The beaches will remain closed until the curfew order is lifted,” Mr. Gimenez said in a statement on Sunday. He cited an emergency order he signed on Saturday imposing a countywide curfew after a small group of protesters set police cars on fire outside the Miami Police Department’s downtown headquarters.

The beach reopenings would have involved a significant police presence. Condominium pools and hotels in the county will be allowed to reopen on Monday as planned.

Three N.C. Officers Fired After Police Find Racist Comments on Video,"Three police officers in Wilmington, N.C., were fired after a supervisor found recorded conversations that included racist remarks, slurs and one officer saying he “can’t wait” to start “slaughtering” black people, the department announced Wednesday.

Chief Donny Williams of the Wilmington Police Department said in a news conference that the officers were fired for misconduct after an internal investigation.

“The conversations included disrespectful language, hate-filled speech and referred to black people as the N-word,” he said. “They also criticized me within this video, several black officers within the agency and made negative comments about individuals outside of the agency. They made negative comments about our Black Lives Matter protests and were critical of our response.”

The firings of the officers came as protests over racism and police mistreatment of black people are resounding across the country, along with calls for greater accountability in law enforcement.

The department identified the officers as James B. Gilmore, 48; Cpl. Jesse E. Moore II, 50; and Michael K. Piner, 44. Chief Williams said the investigation began after a supervisor’s routine inspection found the accidental activation of a patrol car camera, a device fixed in the back of the vehicles to monitor people in custody.

A summary of the internal investigation report on the conversations was released by the department this week. In one conversation, Officers Piner and Gilmore criticize the protests, with Officer Piner saying the Police Department’s only concern was “kneeling down with the black folks,” according to the report.

Officer Gilmore said he saw a video on social media that he described as “white people bowing down on their knees and ‘worshipping blacks,’” the report said.

In another exchange detailed in the report, Corporal Moore called Officer Piner and referred to a black woman he had arrested the day before, using a racial slur and saying she “needed a bullet in her head right then and move on.”

Later in the conversation, Officer Piner told Corporal Moore that he felt a civil war was coming and that he was “ready” and going to buy a new assault rifle. “We are just going to go out and start slaughtering them,” the report quotes Officer Piner, referring to black people with an expletive and racial slur.

“I can’t wait. God, I can’t wait,” he said.

Corporal Moore responded that he would not do that. Officer Piner is quoted as saying that society needed a civil war to “wipe ’em off” the map, to which Corporal Moore responded, “You’re crazy.”

When supervisors confronted the officers with the recordings, each denied being racist and described the pressure that the police were experiencing because of the protests, according to the internal report.

Officer Gilmore told the department that he was unnerved by the video he referred to in conversation because the Bible says not to “bow to any idol,” and that he treats everyone fairly.

Officer Piner said he was under great stress from concern for his and his family’s safety, the report said. He told supervisors that the comments were “uncharacteristic of him, and he was out of control,” according to the report.

Corporal Moore told supervisors that he was off duty, at his home and using his personal phone in the conversation, and that he was extremely stressed and “feeding off of Officer Piner and just venting,” the report said.

The three men could not be reached by telephone on Thursday.

According to their termination letters, the three men were fired for standard of conduct violations, while Officer Piner and Corporal Moore also broke the department’s policy on criticism and inappropriate jokes and slurs with “hate-filled speech.” The department said the three had been police officers since the late 1990s.

Chief Williams said that normally, only a small amount of information is made public, according to personnel laws. “However, in exceptional cases, when it is essential to maintain public confidence in the administration of the city and the Police Department, more information may be released,” he said.

“We must establish new reforms for policing here at home and throughout this country,” he said. The department was taking the rare step of releasing details and records behind the firings because it was “the right thing to do,” he said.

Benjamin David, the district attorney, said in a statement on Wednesday that his office had reviewed and dismissed cases in which the men had been the primary charging officers.

Chief Williams said the department was working with the North Carolina Criminal Justice Training and Standards Commission to determine whether they could maintain their state certification.

“There are certain behaviors that one must have in order to be a police officer, and these three officers have demonstrated that they do not possess it,” he said."
"Tim Scott, Once Quiet on Matters of Race, Embraces Key Role on Police Reform","WASHINGTON — Senator Tim Scott has spent much of his career trying to avoid letting the color of his skin define his political identity, keeping a line at the ready to offer to new acquaintances: “I am a Christian who is a conservative,” he likes to say, “— and you may have noticed, I’m black.”

But when protests for racial justice erupted across the nation this month, thrusting Republicans onto the defensive as the public clamored for action to address systemic racism in policing, it was Mr. Scott who marched up to Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, and asked to write his party’s legislative response. The two men agreed that there was no one better for the job.

The offer, which set in motion the hasty drafting of legislation that Mr. Scott plans to unveil on Wednesday, was the culmination of a subtle transformation for the South Carolina Republican over the past five years. Once determined to make his name on issues like tax cuts and entrepreneurship, rather than his historic status as the first black senator from the South since Reconstruction, Mr. Scott has bit by bit — sometimes reluctantly — become a leader in his party on matters of race.

After years of silence, he has spoken publicly on the Senate floor about being racially profiled by the police as a senator on Capitol Hill. It fell to him in 2017 to privately counsel President Trump about the long history of racism. And last week, Mr. Scott was the one who stood up in a roomful of white Republicans and made a private pitch for a proposal that could answer the strident calls for change — without betraying bedrock party principles.

The emerging bill is expected to be far narrower than the sweeping law enforcement overhaul that Democrats have proposed and far short of what civil rights leaders say is necessary, but its very existence reflects a personal and political journey for Mr. Scott and his view of what can reasonably become law.

“We can all sense the opportunity that is before us,” he said on the Senate floor on Tuesday. “More than at any time I can remember, people of all ages and races are standing up together for the idea that Lady Justice must be blind.”

Friends and colleagues say Mr. Scott’s thinking on matters of race actually began to shift much earlier, in 2015, after his hometown, Charleston, confronted two tragedies in quick succession: the shooting by a white police officer of an unarmed black man, Walter Scott, and then the massacre by a white supremacist of nine black churchgoers as they prayed at Emanuel A.M.E. Church. Now, Republicans are looking to Mr. Scott, 54, to be the party’s leading voice in Congress’s first major debate about policing in a quarter-century, injecting an authoritative conservative voice — who, as he might put it, also happens to be African-American — into the mix.

“He has a particular strength in this moment that other people don’t have,” said Mark Sanford, a former congressman and governor of South Carolina who served alongside Mr. Scott. “It’s one thing for a white guy to stand up. It’s a very different thing for a black man to stand up and say, ‘Well, let me tell you about my personal experience.’”

Mr. Scott, who is frequently described as an eternal optimist guided by his faith, has an exceedingly difficult task. He is trying to balance calls from police unions who are resisting changes and civil rights groups that are clamoring for it, as well as conservative members of his own party and liberals like Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey and the only other black man in the Senate. He has been quietly keeping Mr. Trump abreast of his work.

His unyielding conservatism has also brought bitter and racist vitriol from the left, where some have accused him of betraying black Americans in service to his predominantly white party.

“Not surprising the last 24 hours have seen a lot of ‘token’ ‘boy’ or ‘you’re being used’ in my mentions,” Mr. Scott wrote on Twitter last week. “Let me get this straight…you DON’T want the person who has faced racial profiling by police, been pulled over dozens of times, or been speaking out for YEARS drafting this?”

Mr. Scott has made clear the bill he plans to introduce Wednesday will look quite different from that of Democrats, which would make it easier to prosecute and hold police officers liable for excessive use of force, outlaw chokeholds, and condition federal grants on anti-bias training and data collection. He has signaled that the reforms in his bill will largely be targeted at the local level, and has explicitly ruled out a Democratic measure to change qualified immunity, which shields police officers from being held legally liable for damages sought by citizens whose constitutional rights are found to have been violated.

“One of the other things that has been a big deal to him is this sense that if you are a black man in politics, you automatically agree with other black people in politics,” said Senator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma and a close ally who is working with Mr. Scott on the bill. “There is this quiet kind of pigeonholing of people of color to say you all think alike.”

A spokesman declined to make Mr. Scott available for an interview.

Raised by a single mother who worked 16-hour days as a nurse’s aide, Mr. Scott grew up sharing a bedroom with his mother and older brother. He did not see the ocean, which carried his ancestors to the United States as slaves in the early 1800s, until he was a young man. 

Mr. Scott has said the trajectory of his life began to change in high school, when he met the owner of a local Chick-fil-A who pushed Mr. Scott, then a high school football star, toward business, laying the foundation for his later embrace of the Republican Party and Mr. Scott’s personal mission statement: to have an impact on the lives of one billion people.

He found faith in college, quit football and contemplated the seminary.

Instead, Mr. Scott went into business, becoming a successful insurance salesman and running, in 1995, for a seat on the Charleston County Council. He eventually rose to chairman and won a seat in the State Legislature. In 2010, as the Tea Party wave was sweeping the country in backlash to the first black president, Barack Obama, Mr. Scott decided to run for Congress.

When the historical significance of the election was pointed out to him by a local reporter, Mr. Scott bristled.

“The relevance of me being black is really, fortunately, irrelevant,” he said then. “The voters voted for a guy who they felt represented their values.”

But in the summer of 2015, Mr. Scott began to focus more intently on matters of race and its significance in America. Within days of the shooting at Emanuel A.M.E., he was standing next to the governor at the time, Nikki Haley, as she called for the removal of the Confederate flag from South Carolina’s statehouse. (Some senior Republicans were privately frustrated at the time that Mr. Scott, given his status as the lone black Republican in the Senate, had not spoken alongside Ms. Haley, instead choosing to issue a written statement.)

Afterward, Mr. Scott and Representative Trey Gowdy, a fellow South Carolina Republican, traveled around the state holding meetings between police officers and black pastors that Mr. Gowdy said evolved into “frank, raw conversations about the state of our justice system.” Mr. Scott began calling up Mr. Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor, each time an officer-involved shooting burst into the news, inquiring about the legality surrounding the use of force and the burden of proof in the justice system.

“Look at that — tell me what you see,” Mr. Gowdy recalled Mr. Scott asking. “He wants to understand what the cop sees. Does the cop see the color of the skin? Or does the cop see a shiny object?”

He introduced an act named after Walter Scott to require local law enforcement agencies to report cases in which police officers fatally shoot civilians, and later provided crucial support for a criminal justice reform push and an attempt with the Senate’s two other black members to make lynching a federal crime.

And to colleagues and the public, he began opening up about his own experience. He recounted being pulled over by the police seven times in one year “for driving a new car” and said he had been stopped on Capitol Hill by a police officer who did not believe he was a senator, despite wearing a members-only pin.

He has endured much worse that he has spoken about far less publicly. In 2011, after Mr. Scott, then a congressman, announced that he would oppose legislation intended to remedy the debt-ceiling crisis, angry callers flooded the lines hurling racial epithets at his aides — many of them people of color. His office shut down its phones for the day.

Mr. Trump’s presidency has presented unique and painful dilemmas for Mr. Scott. He has twice torpedoed judicial nominees selected by the president because of racist writings or actions in their pasts. In both cases, Mr. Scott brought the nominees into his office, people familiar with the matter said, in an attempt to find any sign of remorse or evolution. He could not.

Arguably the most trying episode came after the 2017 neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Va., when Mr. Scott publicly condemned Mr. Trump’s suggestion that there had been “very fine people” on “both sides.” His comments got Mr. Scott a summons to the White House and a face-to-face meeting with the president to explain generations of racial hurt.

When Mr. Trump asked what would be helpful to the people his comments had offended, Mr. Scott did not demand any civil rights measure. Instead, he pitched the president on a long-held policy priority, called opportunity zones, that would incentivize companies to invest in areas struggling with economic depression. It became a marquee item in Republicans’ $1.5 trillion tax-cut bill.

“In weighing this dicey situation, I kept in mind that there are some things more important than politics,” Mr. Scott wrote in his memoir. “Namely, that while there may be an ebb and flow in politics, I am going to be black for the rest of my life.”"
George Floyd Protests Reignite Debate Over Confederate Statues,"As protests against racism and police violence spread across the nation, demonstrators in at least six cities focused their anger on symbols of the Confederacy, seizing the opportunity to mar Confederate statues and monuments that have ignited debate for years.

Many of the monuments were vandalized with spray paint; protesters tried to topple others from their bases. In response, at least two cities this week have seen them removed from public spaces.

In Richmond, Va., this weekend, graffiti was scrawled on the headquarters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, and the building also burned for a time. Statues of the Confederate generals J.E.B. Stuart, Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee, all of which stand on the city’s Monument Avenue, were marked.

In Norfolk, Va., on Saturday, protesters climbed a 15-foot figure of a Confederate soldier and spray-painted its base. In Charleston, S.C., “BLM,” for Black Lives Matter, and “Traitors” were spray-painted in red on the base of the Confederate Defenders of Charleston statue, erected in 1932. In North Carolina, a Confederate monument at the State Capitol in Raleigh was marked with a black X.

And in Birmingham, Ala., on Sunday, protesters spray-painted the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument, a 52-foot-tall sandstone obelisk, and chipped at its base. Then, according to news reports, they tried to topple it.

Even as workers arrived to tidy up the destruction, the protests have freshened the conversation around the fate of these controversial memorials, many of which have been the subject of legal challenges, especially in the years since a deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017 over the city’s plan to remove a statue of Lee.

In the weeks after Charlottesville, dozens of plaques, statues and other monuments to the Confederacy were challenged or removed from public places across the country. Since then, there has been no unified plan for what to do with these landmarks. Some have been auctioned, moved, stored, covered or dismantled in recent years; others have remained while legal challenges have played out or failed.

“The conversation has never really died,” said Lecia Brooks, outreach director at the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala.

The group has estimated that at least 138 Confederate symbols have been removed from public spaces since 2015, when it started tracking them after a white supremacist killed nine black congregants at a church in Charleston, S.C.

“There has been a consistent drive, primarily in the South, to remove these monuments,” Ms. Brooks said. “They are a constant reminder of the dehumanization of African-Americans and the pushback against our civil and human rights.”

Confederate monuments that survived the protests are facing renewed scrutiny as protesters, angered by the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25, have taken to the streets in at least 140 cities across the country.

A football coach in Murray, Ky., wrote a public letter to the town’s mayor on Tuesday asking for the removal of a statue of Lee — and offered to help take it down himself.

“I am a black male,” the coach, Sherman Neal II, wrote. “I am no longer willing to accept state-sponsored symbols of institutional racism in my community.”

In an interview, Mr. Neal said he wrote the letter because “you don’t get opportunities like this in history more than once in a lifetime to take action that can result in a change.”

The mayor, Bob Rogers, said the memorial sits on land owned by Calloway County and not the city.

“While we respect the opinions of all of our citizens, we are simply not in a position to legally pursue any efforts with regard to the Robert E. Lee Confederate Memorial,” Mr. Rogers said on Wednesday. County officials declined to comment.

In Huntsville, Ala., where protesters gathered on Monday to demand the removal of a Confederate monument from the grounds of the Madison County Courthouse, according to AL.com, a group of business owners wrote to the city on Tuesday asking that it be moved. “The tragic killing of George Floyd has magnified the deep pain experienced by African-American and other members of our community,” the group wrote.

About 100 miles south of Huntsville, Birmingham’s Confederate monument had been covered since last year amid a legal battle between the state attorney general and the city.

On Monday, a day after protesters began chipping away at the statue’s base, Mayor Randall Woodfin, over the objections of the state’s attorney general, ordered a crew to finish the job. Removing the statue from Linn Park, he said, would “prevent more civil unrest.”

On Tuesday, Alabama’s attorney general, Steve Marshall, announced that the state had filed a lawsuit against the city over its removal of the monument.

In Richmond, Va., an oversized statue of Lee that towers over the city’s Monument Avenue was covered with graffiti, including the phrases “No More White Supremacy” and “Black Lives Matter.” The statue of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States, on the avenue was also painted.

Gov. Northam is expected to announce plans on Thursday for the removal of the Lee statue, according to an administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the move had not yet been publicly announced.

The official spoke on Wednesday, the same day Richmond’s mayor said he would propose removing additional Confederate monuments from the state capital.

Virginia has more than 220 public memorials to the Confederacy, according to the governor’s office. A state law passed this year, which goes into effect on July 1, gives local governments the ability “to remove, relocate, or contextualize the monuments in their communities.”

“These monuments tell a particular version of history that doesn’t include everyone,” Governor Ralph S. Northam said when he signed the legislation in April. “In Virginia, that version of history has been given prominence and authority for far too long.”

In Alexandria, Va., just outside Washington, D.C., a Confederate statue that had been slated to be removed next month was taken down on Tuesday.

The United Daughters of the Confederacy, the group that owns the statue, notified the city on Monday that it would remove it the next day, a spokesman for the city said. He said he did not know what the group planned to do with the statue. The United Daughters of the Confederacy did not respond to a request for comment.

“Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving,"" the city’s mayor, Justin Wilson, said on Twitter, sharing images of its removal.

In Oxford, Miss., the words “spiritual genocide,” along with red handprints, were painted on a Confederate monument on the University of Mississippi campus on Saturday, The Oxford Eagle reported.

The school’s chancellor said planning had begun months ago to relocate the statue from the center of campus.

In an open letter dated Sunday, the chancellor, Glenn F. Boyce, said the death of Mr. Floyd and those of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky “have evoked much anger, horror and disbelief” and “continue to tear apart the fabric of our country and impact our campus.”

“This is a time for change,” he wrote.

In Photos: Protesters March in Cities Across America,"For over two weeks, protests swept across the United States in a forceful outcry against systemic racism and police brutality inspired by the killing of George Floyd on May 25 in Minneapolis. A widely viewed video that showed Officer Derek Chauvin holding a knee to Mr. Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes provoked outrage and swift condemnation.

Local protests that began in Minneapolis quickly spread to New York, Washington and Los Angeles as well as Ferguson, Mo., Tampa, Fla., and Tulsa, Okla. Demonstrators took to the streets by the thousands demanding justice for Mr. Floyd and in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Protesters clashed, sometimes violently, with police forces, many in cities that had been under stay-at-home orders because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Four officers at the scene were fired and arrested, and Mr. Chauvin was ultimately charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, but largely peaceful protests continued through a second weekend and six days of memorials for Mr. Floyd in Minneapolis, Raeford, N.C., and Houston, where he was buried on Tuesday. By Saturday, protests had been held in hundreds of American cities and towns and around the world.

The Pandemic and the Protests,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host.

In theory, a pandemic should be a great equalizer. After all, no matter who you are — rich or poor, famous or ordinary — everyone can get sick. And death doesn’t discriminate.

Instead, the coronavirus has exacerbated America’s already deep inequalities. Now, the streets are filled with the reaction to that reality.

Three major upheavals — nationwide protests of racial injustice, record-setting unemployment and a deadly pandemic — are rocking our politics, our economy and our lives, and they’re deeply intertwined.

Take what Marcos Parker, a 19-year-old who was detained on a burglary charge in New York City, told our Metro reporter Jan Ransom when he was released on Wednesday.

“I won’t lie. I was looting,” he said. He said he had stolen merchandise because he had lost his job. “It was really this coronavirus,” he said. “I was working before corona.”

When it comes to the virus, the whole country is paying a price. But the costs of our sacrifices differ dramatically based on our race.

Black Americans are dying of Covid-19 at much higher rates than whites, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Counties with a disproportionately high black population account for more than half of the country’s coronavirus cases and nearly 60 percent of deaths, according to a national study by an AIDS research group.

To use just one example, in mid-April, all eight people who had died of the virus in Richmond, Va., were black.

Communities of color also shoulder a great share of the economic impacts of the virus.

Even before the virus, the gap between the finances of blacks and whites was larger in 2020 than it was in 1968, another year of upheaval, according to The Washington Post.

In 1968, a typical middle-class black household had $6,674 in wealth compared to $70,786 for the typical middle-class white household, according to data from the historical Survey of Consumer Finances that’s been adjusted for inflation. In 2016, the typical middle-class black household had $13,024 in wealth versus $149,703 for the median white household, an even larger gap in percentage terms.

“The historical data also reveal that no progress has been made in reducing income and wealth inequalities between black and white households over the past 70 years,” wrote the economists Moritz Kuhn, Moritz Schularick and Ulrike I. Steins in their analysis of U.S. incomes and wealth since World War II.

Less than half of black adults currently have a job, The New York Times reported this week. Black employees have reported being furloughed and laid off at higher rates than whites. Those who have kept their jobs are more likely to be deemed “essential” workers in industries exposed to the virus. Black workers make up 11.9 percent of all jobholders but 17 percent of front-line workers, one study found. Latinos are also disproportionately represented in many of these metrics.

While the protests were ignited by the killing of George Floyd and the issue of police brutality, the anger and unrest cannot be separated from the unequal cost of the virus.

Some activists and politicians have started to refer to the situation as a “pandemic within a pandemic.”

“We are managing that trauma and that loss,” Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts said in an interview Wednesday on “CBS This Morning.” “A public health pandemic and the scourge that is police brutality layered with the trauma of housing injustice, economic injustice, education injustice and health care injustice.”

Drawing on the work of the Princeton political scientist Omar Wasow, the Times columnist Ross Douthat argued this week that there’s much to learn today from the unrest of the 1960s. He quotes Mr. Wasow’s findings: “Proximity to black-led nonviolent protests increased white Democratic vote-share, whereas proximity to black-led violent protests caused substantively important declines.”

Mr. Douthat concludes, as Mr. Wasow’s research suggests, that violent protest was generally bad for Democrats — so much so that it was “enough to tip the 1968 election from Hubert Humphrey to Nixon.” That means any violent protests now could help President Trump’s re-election bid as a “law and order” candidate, he argues.

Jamelle Bouie, a columnist for the Times’s Opinion section, disagrees that today’s protests recall those of the 1960s. He writes, “Trump’s plan to campaign as the second coming of Richard Nixon shows the limits of historical analogy. It’s not 1968.”

Mr. Bouie draws a distinction between how the protests were understood then, and how they are understood now: “There appears to be greater sympathy for the protesters and their grievances, so much so that most public officials outside of the president and his closest allies have shown some understanding of the anger and discontent even as they oppose riots and disorder.” And our political climate of unrest, Mr. Bouie contends, “is happening against a backdrop of deprivation and deep inequality, not the relative prosperity of the late 1960s.”

Mr. Trump will have a hard time making the same “law and order” political case as Nixon did, Mr. Bouie says. Still, Mr. Douthat cautions that “recognizing how the politics of riots usually play out imposes a special burden to forestall and contain them.”

Gambia Seeks Answers Over a Police Shooting in Georgia,"The Gambian government is calling for an investigation into the death of Momodou Lamin Sisay, the 39-year-old son of a retired United Nations employee who was fatally shot by a police officer in Snellville, Ga., in the early morning hours of May 29.

The case comes in the midst of a nationwide protest movement against police violence, and although the police say Mr. Sisay shot at them before he was killed, the outcry over his death reflects the mounting public skepticism over American police departments’ use of force against black men.

A protest march against police brutality planned in Snellville in the coming days, spurred by the death last week of George Floyd in the custody of the police in Minneapolis, will also include the case of Mr. Sisay.

In Gambia, many people took to social media to deplore the incident and criticize their government for not speaking out sooner.

One of the country’s most prominent human rights activists, Madi Jobarteh, started a petition protesting Mr. Sisay’s death, which he said would be delivered to the United States embassy in Banjul on Monday. If the nation’s coronavirus restrictions are lifted by then, he said there would also be a protest outside the embassy.

Mr. Sisay’s father, Lare Sisay, who worked for the United Nations before he retired, described his son as “very pious” and someone who “goes to the mosque and prays.”

“He wasn’t into any sort of trouble that I am aware of,” Mr. Sisay told the Fatu Network, the most prominent news site in Gambia, adding, “He does not like violence of any kind.” On his Facebook page, Mr. Sisay said he formerly worked for the United Nations Development Program.

Taking to social media, the elder Mr. Sisay connected his son’s death to the problem of police violence against black men.

“America is burning! Let’s pray for our loved ones out there cause they’d need it!” he wrote on Facebook the day after his son was killed. “Overt racism is tearing America at the seams and the black community is at the receiving end of the overt racism where police men kill black men at will.”

Butch Sanders, the city manager of Snellville, said the timing of Mr. Sisay’s death was unfortunately close to that of Mr. Floyd, but that the two incidents should not be compared. He said the police report states that Mr. Sisay pointed his gun at the officers before they opened fire, and discharged his own revolver five times during the altercation.

“We pride ourselves that we have a professional police force that makes good decisions, and I can tell you that this situation is 180 degrees different from the George Floyd situation,” he said. “It’s just a terrible unfortunate incident, and the timing is obviously awful. It’s just the facts are so much different.”

The fatal encounter began around 4 a.m. on May 29, when Mr. Sisay refused to stop his car as police officers attempted to pull him over for having expired registration tags, according to a preliminary report from the Georgia Bureau of Investigations. The police then “initiated a pursuit intervention technique which caused the vehicle to leave the roadway,” the report said. Mr. Sisay refused to comply with verbal orders to raise his hands and instead flashed a handgun at officers, it said.

An officer fired at Mr. Sisay, then retreated for cover, after which Mr. Sisay revved his engine, attempting to flee the scene, the report said. Officers called for backup from the Gwinnett County SWAT team, but Mr. Sisay continued to refuse to comply with verbal orders and instead fired his weapon at the officers. One officer returned fire, killing Mr. Sisay, the report said.

But a recorded interview conducted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution with two officers who were present during the altercation told a different story. In it, Detective Jeff Manley of the Snellville Police Department said that Mr. Sisay discharged his weapon before the SWAT team arrived. An officer with the Gwinnett County Police Department made no mention of Mr. Sisay discharging his weapon.

Abdul Jaiteh, the family’s lawyer, said it was significant that the incident occurred just days after the highly publicized death of Mr. Floyd in Minneapolis, when black people everywhere were hyperaware of the potential for the police to do harm.

“Any black man will be scared of the police officers, especially in this situation,” he said in an interview.

Mr. Jaiteh questioned whether Mr. Sisay had truly discharged his weapon, saying it was “uncharacteristic” of him. He has asked to view footage from the body cameras of the officers, but it has not been released.

Mr. Jaiteh said he thought the officers had escalated the situation hastily and unnecessarily because Mr. Sisay was black.

“We’ve seen standoffs between suspects and police officers that could last for five-plus hours. They give you the benefit of the doubt,” he said. “They do everything they can to convince you to surrender to save your life. Black people, we don’t get the same benefit. It’s like in a split second, they will pull the trigger and kill you.”

Gambia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that it had asked the Gambian embassy in Washington to “engage the relevant U.S. authorities including the State Department to seek a transparent, credible and objective investigation” into the matter.

It said that consular officials were in Georgia “to support the family of the deceased and to also work with U.S. authorities in establishing circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Sisay.”

Nelly Miles, a spokesman for Georgia’s state bureau of investigations, said the officers’ body cameras were recording during the altercation but that the footage is not being released because the investigation is ongoing.

Like many people who were moved to protest by Mr. Floyd’s death, Carrick Henry, a recent high school graduate who is organizing the march against police brutality in Snellville, said the actions he is taking now are informed in part by his own experiences with racism.

“I’ve sort of suppressed it in my life. It’s something you don’t want to dwell on. But seeing that video sparked something in me,” he said of Mr. Floyd’s case.

He said he saw Mr. Sisay’s death as part of a much bigger problem of aggressive policing tactics, and said that the police have lost credibility after years of African-American deaths at their hands.

After so many incidents have been captured in graphic videos, Mr. Carrick said that many African-Americans fear for their lives during even the most mundane encounters with the police. That, he said, could help explain why Mr. Sisay might have brandished a weapon during the late-night traffic stop.

“He probably felt threatened, and he felt like his life was in danger,” Mr. Henry said. “He didn’t know how to handle that.”"
"As Protests and Violence Spill Over, Trump Shrinks Back","WASHINGTON — Inside the White House, the mood was bristling with tension. Hundreds of protesters were gathering outside the gates, shouting curses at President Trump and in some cases throwing bricks and bottles. Nervous for his safety, Secret Service agents abruptly rushed the president to the underground bunker used in the past during terrorist attacks.

The scene on Friday night, described by a person with firsthand knowledge, kicked off an uneasy weekend at the White House as demonstrations spread after the brutal death of a black man in police custody under a white officer’s knee. While in the end officials said they were never really in danger, Mr. Trump and his family have been rattled by protests near the Executive Mansion that turned violent for a third night on Sunday.

After days in which the empathy he expressed for George Floyd, the man killed, was overshadowed by his combative threats to ramp up violence against looters and rioters, Mr. Trump spent Sunday out of sight, even as some of his campaign advisers were recommending that he deliver a nationally televised address before another night of violence. The building was even emptier than usual as some White House officials planning to work were told not to come in case of renewed unrest.

“We are having peaceful speeches, we have a reverend —” Protesters gathered outside in Minneapolis on Saturday, for the fifth day in a row. This group was demonstrating outside the city’s Fifth Police Precinct. “I can’t stand the fact that some people in our society can’t walk around without feeling scared that a cop is not going to come to them with a death sentence.” Just after 8 p.m., police came out to enforce the city’s curfew. “You are in violation of Minneapolis city curfew ordinance.” They began firing pepper spray and tear gas to disperse the group. [screams] “I swear to God! I swear to [expletive] God —” Protesters here told us why they were out on the streets. “Honestly, the world is watching the United States, and more specifically Minneapolis itself, to see how we’re going to react and get justice for Mr. Floyd. And for me, being out here is a huge thing.” “The Minneapolis Police Department is notorious for their racism here. Black men are about 13 times more likely to be killed by cops than white men in the city. And I think that people just finally had enough.” “They tortured him, right? What else is there to do but get their attention?” Since George Floyd’s death, peaceful protests have mixed with looting and rioting at night. Most protesters we spoke with oppose the violence, but many said they understood the frustration and anger people are feeling. “No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace!” “We are here for justice for George. We’re sick and tired of being abused and oppressed by the police. They’ve been doing that [expletive] for years and years.” “Man, we’ve got to come together as a people, as a one. This racism’s been going on for too long.” “All four hundred years or more.” “Too long.” “All this [expletive] can be replaced. The body cannot be replaced.” “The body can never be replaced.” “I don’t want to see businesses burned down. But, I mean, we’re in kind of a war zone out here. And so, that’s kind of, I think, the least of our worries in a lot of ways.” “Bring him, bring him, bring him one block. Bring him one block to a medic.” “What happened? Someone hit him with a bat?” “You’ve got to calm down. We’re on the same team.” “You’ve got to calm down.” “Calm down — what happened, what happened? We’ve got about 12 medics here. We’re going to do the best we can. We’ve got a combat medic here, OK? But we’ve got to dial it down —” “We’ve got to keep it down.” “— because they’re looking for any reason to kill us.” One protester described the violence that broke out after she confronted a group of rioters in the neighborhood. “There was a group of guys who started screaming at the police, throwing things. I asked them, ‘Who are you? Who are you to come in here and do this?’ They ran up on me with big steel pipes. They got in my face. And one guy came at me, holding the pipe, and he stepped in, and he took it.” “You’re going to be all right —” “What message are we sending by destroying what is ours? How does that, how does that get the message out about how we need change in our city if all we’re doing is destroying it and burning it down?”

Thousands of protesters demonstrated peacefully near the White House during the day, but by nightfall, with hundreds still in the streets, the scene turned more volatile as crowds surged forward against lines of riot police with plastic shields as the two sides vied for control of Lafayette Square across from the White House. Protesters threw water bottles, set off fireworks and burned a pile of wood and at least one car.

[Follow our live updates on the George Floyd protests across the country.]

One of the fires on H Street NW a block from the White House may have spread because soon afterward flames erupted in the basement of St. John’s Episcopal Church, the iconic “church of presidents” attended at least once by every chief executive going back to James Madison, but were soon doused by firefighters. Businesses far away from the White House boarded up to guard against vandalism, and Mayor Muriel E. Bowser ordered an 11 p.m. curfew. The White House turned off at least some of its exterior lights.

Mr. Trump remained cloistered inside, periodically sending out Twitter messages like “LAW & ORDER!” until the evening, when he went quiet. While some aides urged him to keep off Twitter, Mr. Trump could not resist blasting out a string of messages earlier in the day berating Democrats for not being tough enough and attributing the turmoil to radical leftists.

“Get tough Democrat Mayors and Governors,” he wrote. Referring to his presumptive Democratic presidential opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., he added: “These people are ANARCHISTS. Call in our National Guard NOW. The World is watching and laughing at you and Sleepy Joe. Is this what America wants? NO!!!”

The president said his administration “will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,” referring to the shorthand for “anti-fascist,” and scheduled a meeting with Attorney General William P. Barr for Monday morning. But antifa is a movement of activists who dress in black and have used tactics similar to those of anarchists, not an organization with a clear structure that can be penalized under law. Moreover, American law applies terrorist designations to foreign entities, not domestic groups.

By targeting antifa, however, Mr. Trump effectively paints all the protests with the brush of violent radicalism without addressing the underlying conditions that have driven many people to the streets. Demonstrations have broken out in at least 75 cities in recent days, with governors and mayors deploying the National Guard or imposing curfews on a scale not seen since the aftermath of the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968.

While Mr. Trump has been a focus of anger, particularly among the crowds in Washington, aides repeatedly have tried to explain to him that the protests were not only about him, but about broader, systemic issues related to race, according to several people familiar with the discussions. Privately, advisers complained about his tweets, acknowledging that they were pouring fuel on an already incendiary situation.

“Those are not constructive tweets, without any question,” Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the Senate, said in an interview on “Fox News Sunday.” “I’m thankful that we can have the conversation. We don’t always agree on any of his tweets beforehand, but we have the ability to sit down and dialogue on how we move this nation forward.”

Dan Eberhart, a Republican donor and supporter of Mr. Trump, said the president, with election looming in five months, is focused on catering to his core supporters rather than the nation at large. “Trump is far more divisive than past presidents,” Mr. Eberhart said. “His strength is stirring up his base, not calming the waters.”

Robert C. O’Brien, the president’s national security adviser, said the president would continue “to take a strong stand for law and order” even as he understood the anger over Mr. Floyd’s death.

“We want peaceful protesters who have real concerns about brutality and racism. They need to be able to go to the city hall. They need to be able to petition their government and let their voices be heard,” Mr. O’Brien said on “State of the Union” on CNN. “And they can’t be hijacked by these left-wing antifa militants who are burning down primarily communities in the African-American sections and the Hispanic sections of our city.”

But Mr. Trump’s absence rankled the Democrats he was criticizing.

“What I’d like to hear from the president is leadership,” Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta said on “Meet the Press” on NBC. “And I would like to hear a genuine care and concern for our communities and where we are with race relations in America.”

Some officials were urging that Mr. Trump hold events to show black voters enraged over the latest videotaped act of brutality that he heard their views. A group of advisers discussed plans for a series of “listening” events. But others have counseled that the president should take a hard line, not quite as aggressive as his tweets but a message of solidarity to business owners whose property has been destroyed.

Some in the president’s circle see the escalations as a political boon, much in the way Richard M. Nixon won the presidency on a law-and-order platform after the 1968 riots. One adviser to Mr. Trump, who insisted on anonymity to describe private conversations, said images of widespread destruction could be helpful to the law-and-order message that Mr. Trump has projected since his 2016 campaign.

The adviser said that it could particularly appeal to older women at a time when Mr. Trump’s support among seniors has eroded amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately affected them. The risk, this adviser added, is that people are worn out by the president’s behavior.

The difference is that, unlike Mr. Nixon, Mr. Trump is the incumbent. And other advisers said most top aides were unhappy with Mr. Trump’s 1 a.m. tweet on Friday invoking a 1967 quote from a Miami police chief about “shooting” black people during civil unrest. Those advisers said it was far from certain that Mr. Trump could use the violent outbreaks in cities to improve his weak standing with suburban women and independent voters.

The election was clearly on the president’s mind on Sunday. In response to questions about what he was doing to address the tumult, Mr. Trump forwarded a reply through an aide that focused on the upcoming campaign.

“I’m going to win the election easily,” the president said. “The economy is going to start to get good and then great, better than ever before. I’m getting more judges appointed by the week, including two Supreme Court justices, and I’ll have close to 300 judges by the end of the year.” (So far he has confirmed about 200.)

An administration official said Mr. Trump met on Sunday with generals to discuss a variety of matters and talked with world leaders as he considered how to restructure the annual Group of 7 international summit that he decided to postpone. Mr. Trump will join Vice President Mike Pence on a previously scheduled conference call with governors on Monday as part of the coronavirus response, and the unrest is expected to be discussed.

Some campaign advisers were pressing for a formal address to the nation as early as Sunday. But White House officials, recalling Mr. Trump’s error-filled Oval Office address in March about the spread of the coronavirus, cautioned that it was not necessary. Mr. Trump quizzed advisers throughout the day about whether he should give an Oval Office address.

Mr. Trump already tried to recalibrate by ripping up his speech at the Kennedy Space Center on Saturday after the launch of the new crewed SpaceX rocket and adding a long passage about Mr. Floyd. In the speech, Mr. Trump repeated his calls for law and order, but in more measured terms and leavened by expressions of sympathy for Mr. Floyd’s family, whom he had called to offer condolences.

Aides were disappointed that the remarks, delivered late Saturday afternoon as part of a speech otherwise celebrating the triumph of the space program, did not get wider attention, but they said they hoped they would break through. Several administration officials said Mr. Trump was genuinely horrified by the video of Mr. Floyd’s last minutes, mentioning it several times in private conversations over the last few days.

Mr. Trump and his team seemed taken off guard by the protests that materialized outside the White House on Friday night. Hundreds of people surged toward the White House as Secret Service and United States Park Police officers sought to block them. Bricks and bottles were thrown, and the police responded with pepper spray. At one point, an official said, a barricade near the Treasury Department next door to the White House was penetrated.

It was not clear what specifically prompted the Secret Service to whisk Mr. Trump to the Presidential Emergency Operations Center, as the underground bunker is known, but the agency has protocols for protecting the president when the building is threatened.

Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said officials would not comment on whether Mr. Trump was taken to the underground bunker. “The White House does not comment on security protocols and decisions,” Mr. Deere said.

Vice President Dick Cheney was brought to the bunker on Sept. 11, 2001, when the authorities feared one of the planes hijacked by Al Qaeda was heading toward the White House. President George W. Bush, who was out of town until that evening, was rushed there later that night after a false alarm of another plane threat.

The bunker has not been used much, if at all, since those early days of the war on terrorism, but it has been hardened to withstand the force of a passenger jet crashing into the mansion above.

The president and his family were rattled by their experience on Friday night, according to several advisers.

After his evening in the bunker, Mr. Trump emerged on Saturday morning to boast that he never felt unsafe, and he vowed to sic “vicious dogs” and “ominous weapons” on intruders. Melania Trump opted not to travel to Florida for the rocket launch. One person briefed on the events said the first lady, anxious about the protests, made the decision at the last minute, but another person briefed on what took place disputed that.

After Mr. Trump returned to the White House from Florida on Saturday, he found a White House again under siege. This time, security was ready. Washington police blocked off roads for blocks around the building, while hundreds of police officers and National Guard troops ringed the exterior perimeter wearing helmets and riot gear and holding up plastic shields.

The scene was similar Sunday night as well. Protesters shouted “no justice, no peace,” and “black lives matter” as well as chanting expletives at Mr. Trump. Washington icons like the Hay-Adams Hotel and the Oval Room restaurant, damaged from the night before, were boarded up.

Graffiti was spray-painted for blocks, including on the historic Decatur House a block from the White House: “Why do we have to keep telling you black lives matter?”

Family of Black Man Found Hanging Says Death Was by Suicide,"When the authorities suggested that two black men whose bodies were found hanging from trees in two Southern California cities had died by suicide, many community activists did not buy it.

Their fear: The men had been lynched.

But family members of 38-year-old Malcolm Harsch, one of the two men, said through a spokesman that after reviewing video footage provided by the police, they were now convinced that he died by suicide. Mr. Harsch was found on May 31 in Victorville, Calif., near a homeless encampment where he was living.

Family members of 24-year-old Robert Fuller, the other man whose body was found hanging, are still waiting for the results of an investigation into his death, which occurred in Palmdale this month.

After initially saying there was no sign of foul play in either case, the local authorities, responding to pleas from community activists, promised full investigations into the deaths of both men, a reaction in part to the protests in California and across the country against police brutality and racism. The F.B.I. is also monitoring the inquiries.

Najee Ali, the spokesman for the Harsch family and a community activist based in Los Angeles who led protests after the deaths of Mr. Fuller and Mr. Harsch, said on Saturday that Mr. Harsch’s family had wanted a full investigation into what happened, particularly given Southern California’s well-documented presence of white supremacist groups.

“Due to the fact that he was an African-American homeless man with no family initially, his life and investigation were devalued and put on the back burner,” he said of the police, which he said took action to investigate Mr. Harsch’s death only after news reports and demonstrations.

“The stress from being homeless, the lack of hope and the despair led him to choose to, unfortunately, end his life,” he said.

John McMahon, the sheriff-coroner in the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department, said in a statement on Friday that detectives obtained surveillance video from a vacant building near where Mr. Harsch’s body was discovered.

“Although there remains no sign of foul play, the forensic pathologist is waiting for toxicology results before assigning the cause and manner of death,” he said.

A spokeswoman for the department did not respond to a request for a response on Saturday to accusations that it was slow to address the investigation into Mr. Harsch’s life because he was homeless and black.

Mr. Harsch’s relatives, who had not known that he was homeless, did not believe at first that he died by suicide, Mr. Ali said. Mr. Harsch moved several years ago to California from Ohio, where his children and their mother live, to pursue a career as a rapper.

Activists said they worried that the deaths of Mr. Fuller, Mr. Harsch and at least three other hangings in public places in recent days in Texas and New York City were signs of a backlash by white supremacists against the Black Lives Matter movement, prompting others to call for federal investigations.

“It did honestly strike real fear into black Americans’ hearts nationwide because of the thousands of blacks who were lynched in the early 1900s to early 1960s,” Mr. Ali said. “There’s a part of the community that honestly feels a sense of relief that it wasn’t an attack by skinheads, a white supremacist, against a black.”"
"A Black Man Was Found Hanging From a Tree, and a Community Demands Answers","City officials in Palmdale, Calif., said on Saturday that they support calls by activists and residents who have demanded an independent investigation into the death of a 24-year-old black man who was found hanging from a tree in a public square this week.

The death of the man, Robert L. Fuller, which officials initially deemed a suicide, has deeply shaken the city in northern Los Angeles County and has reverberated far beyond amid nationwide protests against racism that were set off by the death of George Floyd.

At a rally for Mr. Fuller on Saturday, his sister, Diamond Alexander, said that the initial determination by officials that her brother hanged himself did not make sense.

“Everything that they’ve been telling us has not been right,” she said, according to video of the rally in Palmdale. “We’ve been hearing one thing. Then we hear another. And we just want to know the truth.”

She added: “My brother was not suicidal. He wasn’t.”

Hundreds of people marched and held signs that read, “Justice for Robert Fuller” and “Black Lives Matter.” Protesters called out: “Say his name!” and the crowd chanted, “Robert Fuller.”

A passer-by found Mr. Fuller’s body hanging from a tree in Poncitlán Square, across from Palmdale City Hall, at around 3:39 a.m. on Wednesday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.

Personnel from a nearby fire station responded and determined that Mr. Fuller was dead, the department said. The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Homicide Bureau and the Los Angeles County Coroner’s Office also responded.

“Although the investigation is ongoing, it appears Mr. Fuller, tragically, committed suicide,” the Sheriff’s Department said in a statement on Friday, adding that a full autopsy was expected soon.

The city of Palmdale said in a statement on Saturday that it was “officially supporting the call for an independent investigation and an independent autopsy” of Mr. Fuller.

“The City of Palmdale is joining the family and the community’s call for justice, and we do support a full investigation into his death,” the statement said. “We will settle for nothing less than a thorough accounting of this matter.”

Deputy Sheriff Eric Ortiz, a department spokesman, said on Saturday that the agency had no immediate response to the call by city officials and activists for an independent investigation. He said the Homicide Bureau was continuing to investigate. The county coroner’s office did not immediately respond to messages on Saturday.

After officials released their account of Mr. Fuller’s death this week, it was immediately challenged by activists, residents and people on social media.

At a news conference called by officials at Palmdale City Hall on Friday, residents said they had no faith in the local authorities to properly investigate Mr. Fuller’s death and wanted complete transparency and an independent review.

“Why was it right here in public, in front of City Hall, next to a church, in front of a library?” one woman said. “Why was it like that? Who would do that? No black man would hang himself in public like that.”

Others demanded to know if there were video cameras in the area and to know who found Mr. Fuller.

The Palmdale city manager, J.J. Murphy, said that the city was working with the authorities to identify footage from cameras around the area. There are no city cameras in the park, he said.

Some said the authorities had rushed to judgment without gathering all of the facts.

“That’s a lie!” several people shouted after Capt. Ronald Shaffer of the Sheriff’s Department said it appeared that Mr. Fuller died by suicide.

“Can I also ask that we stop talking about lynchings?” Mr. Murphy said at another point during the news conference, prompting people in attendance to respond, “Hell no!”

Kim Kardashian West, the reality TV star, weighed in on Twitter on Friday, urging her more than 65 million followers to sign a petition to demand a thorough investigation.

“This was not a case of suicide but murder,” reads the petition.

The N.A.A.C.P.’s Antelope Valley branch said in a statement that law enforcement needed to provide answers.

“A grieving family deserves to know if foul play was involved,” the statement said.

Mayor R. Rex Parris of Lancaster, a nearby city, said law enforcement officials told him on Friday that all signs pointed to a suicide, and that there were no signs indicating any other cause of death.

“There were apparently scars on his body consistent with previous attempts,” Mr. Parris said.

In a Facebook post on Thursday, Ms. Alexander included a link to a local news story about the body found hanging from a tree.

“Words can’t describe how much my family is hurting right now,” she said in a separate post on Thursday. Ms. Alexander asked for the public’s help, urging anyone who had seen anything to “please come forward.”"
‘The World is on Fire:’ Artists Respond to the Protests,"Compiled by Antonio de Luca and Jaspal Riyait

Thousands of people have taken to the streets over the last week to protest police brutality and systemic racism, sparking a movement that has inspired hundreds of demonstrations across the country and ushered in a new wave of themed art.

Created by amateurs and professionals alike, a vast collection of drawings, paintings and illustrations — posted to Instagram using the hashtags #blacklivesmatter, #georgefloyd, #icantbreathe, #saytheirnames and #BLM — illuminates a broader portrait of support and solidarity.

Racial justice, outrage, community and change are among the themes being expressed by scores of artists. Here is a selection.

Majority of Minneapolis City Council Pledges to Dismantle Police Department,"This briefing has ended. Click here for the latest updates.

transcript

Our commitment is to do what’s necessary to keep every single member of our community safe. And to tell the truth that the Minneapolis police are not doing that. Our commitment is to end our city’s toxic relationship with the Minneapolis Police Department to end the policing as we know it, and to recreate systems of public safety that actually keep us safe.

Nine members — a veto-proof majority — of the Minneapolis City Council pledged on Sunday to dismantle the city’s Police Department, promising to create a new system of public safety in a city where law enforcement has long been accused of racism.

Saying that the city’s current policing system could not be reformed, the council members stood before hundreds of people who gathered late in the day on a grassy hill, and signed a pledge to begin the process of taking apart the Police Department as it now exists.

For activists who have been pushing for years for drastic changes to policing, the move represented a turning point that they hoped would lead to a complete transformation of public safety in the city.

“It shouldn’t have taken so much death to get us here,” Kandace Montgomery, the director of Black Vision, said from the stage at the rally. “We’re safer without armed, unaccountable patrols supported by the state hunting black people.”

The pledge in Minneapolis, where George Floyd died 13 days ago after being pinned to the ground by a white police officer’s knee, reflected calls across America to completely rethink what policing looks like. Protesters have taken to the streets with demands to shrink or abolish police departments, and “defund the police” has become a frequent rallying cry.

Officials in other cities, including New York, have begun to talk of diverting some money and responsibilities from police forces to social services agencies, but no other major city has yet gone as far as the Minneapolis officials promised to do.

Council members said in interviews on Sunday that they did not have specific plans to announce for what a new public safety system for the city would look like. They promised to develop plans by working with the community, and said they would draw on past studies, consent decrees and reforms to policing across the nation and the world.

Protesters who gathered at the rally, with a view of Powderhorn Lake, said what mattered most was that elected officials had finally committed to a sweeping overhaul of policing, even if they had yet to offer specifics for how such a dismantling would work.

“There needs to be change,” said Paola Lehman, a 23-year-old actor and educator in Minneapolis.

Though the City Council controls the police budget, the department answers to Mayor Jacob Frey, who can veto the council’s actions. Council members said they had enough votes to override a veto by Mr. Frey, who was booed out of a rally by hundreds of people on Saturday after he said he did not believe in abolishing the Police Department.

The pledge “signals a strong and clear direction about where this is going,” said Councilwoman Alondra Cano, the chair of the council’s Public Safety Committee.

One person was shot and another person was arrested Sunday night in Seattle after a man carrying a pistol drove his vehicle through a crowd of protesters, the authorities said.

The Seattle Fire Department said a 27-year-old man injured in a shooting and was taken to the hospital. He is in stable condition.

Videos from the scene show a black vehicle driving down a crowded street toward an intersection where protesters were gathered near a Seattle Police Department station house in the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood.

After the vehicle came to a stop, a gunshot appeared to go off, sending people running from the vehicle.

In a video posted by a photojournalist, Alex Garland, the man who was shot appeared to be treated by street medics.

The victim said he saw the car coming down the street and pursued it to try and protect the crowd.

The man said he punched the driver before being shot.

The Seattle Police Department said the driver was in custody and a gun was recovered. The authorities said they do not believe there were other victims beyond the man who was shot.

Elsewhere across the country demonstrations have become less pitched, but protesters continue to clash with the police in Seattle. On Saturday, chaos broke out near the same police stations and officers used flash grenades and pepper spray to disperse the crowds.

President Trump said on Sunday that he had ordered National Guard troops to begin withdrawing from the nation’s capital, retreating after a week of relentless criticism over his threat to militarize the government’s response to nationwide protests — including criticism from within the military establishment.

Three former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff harshly condemned Mr. Trump on Sunday for sending troops to deal with domestic protests, and warned that the military risked losing credibility with the American people.

Announcing his order on Twitter, Mr. Trump said the National Guard soldiers would withdraw “now that everything is under perfect control.”

“They will be going home, but can quickly return, if needed,” he wrote. “Far fewer protesters showed up last night than anticipated!”

(In fact, the daylong protests in Washington on Saturday appeared to draw larger crowds than earlier rallies.)

The announcement capped a tumultuous week in which federal authorities violently cleared away peaceful protesters outside the White House to make way for a photo opportunity by Mr. Trump; National Guard helicopters flew low over demonstrators to scatter them; and active-duty troops were summoned to positions just outside the capital.

Those actions and a threat by the president to send the military into states to control protests over the death of a black man in police custody prompted unusually public dissent from former military leaders, and discord even in Mr. Trump’s administration.

On Sunday, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington called the Trump administration’s deployment of troops to the capital area “an invasion.” And the retired military commanders said the troops should never have been there in the first place.

“We have a military to fight our enemies, not our own people,” retired Navy Adm. Mike Mullen, who was the top military adviser to Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, told “Fox News Sunday.”

He said putting troops into domestic demonstrations risked the trust the Pentagon had worked to regain with the American people after the upheaval of the Vietnam War.

“In very short order, should we get into conflict in our own streets, there’s a very significant chance we could lose that trust that it’s taken us 50-plus years to restore,” Mr. Mullen said.

In a telephone call with reporters on Sunday, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said about 5,000 National Guard troops in Washington would withdraw over the next three days because the protests had “become peaceful in nature.” About 1,200 troops from the District of Columbia National Guard will remain on duty “in the coming days,” he said, supporting civilian law enforcement.

On Saturday, The New York Times reported that Mr. McCarthy and other top Pentagon officials had ordered National Guard helicopters to use what they called “persistent presence” to disperse protests in the capital. The loosely worded order prompted a series of low-altitude maneuvers that human rights organizations quickly criticized as a show of force usually reserved for combat zones.

Officials said the Army had opened an investigation into the episode.

In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced that the California National Guard would depart the city on Sunday evening.

transcript

I said in our State of the City speech, quote, ‘Our young people don’t need to be policed. They need to be reached.’ And that is the spirit of the reforms we’re going to talk about today and beyond. We will be moving funding from the N.Y.P.D. to youth initiatives and social services. The details will be worked out in the budget process in the weeks ahead. But I want people to understand that we are committed to shifting resources to ensure that the focus is on our young people. And I also will affirm, while doing that we will only do it in a way that we are certain continues to ensure that this city will be safe.

Mayor Bill de Blasio pledged on Sunday to cut the budget for the New York Police Department and spend more on social services in the city, following 10 nights of mass protests against police violence and mounting demands that he overhaul a department whose tactics have drawn widespread criticism.

It was the first time Mr. de Blasio has promised to cut the force’s budget, and it came as calls have intensified across the country to “defund the police,” a broad term that has included similar proposals to trim police budgets and redistribute the money to social programs.

The move was a reversal for Mr. de Blasio, who expressed skepticism about cutting police funding as recently as Friday. He did not specify which social services he wanted to spend more on.

He also declined to say precisely how much money he planned to divert from the Police Department, which has an annual budget of $6 billion, representing more than 6 percent of Mr. de Blasio’s proposed $90 billion city budget.

“We’re committed to seeing a shift of funding to youth services, to social services, that will happen literally in the course of the next three weeks, but I’m not going to go into detail because it is subject to negotiation, and we want to figure out what makes sense,” Mr. de Blasio said.

Many protesters and observers have accused the police of using unnecessarily violent tactics to enforce the city’s curfew, which began last Monday and was lifted Sunday.

The mayor of Boston, Marty Walsh, said in a televised interview on Sunday that his city should consider a similar reallocation of money now budgeted for policing.

Democrats in Congress are preparing sweeping legislation that would make it easier to prosecute police misconduct and recover damages from officers found to have violated civil rights. But some architects of the bill are stopping short of explicitly embracing what many protesters across the country are demanding: to “defund the police.”

“I don’t believe that you should disband police departments,” Karen Bass, Democrat of California and chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said Sunday on the CNN program “State of the Union.” “But I do think that in cities and states, we need to look at how we are spending resources and invest more in our communities.”

The legislation, which is scheduled for formal release on Monday, would significantly change federal law and require states and municipalities to make modifications of their own, such as instituting mandatory bias training to qualify for federal funds, according to a draft summary obtained by The New York Times.

The bill would also create a national registry to track police misconduct, and it would ban certain chokeholds and other tactics that police officers have used in confrontations that left black Americans dead.

Protesters have embraced “defund the police” as a rallying cry, with some activists painting the phrase alongside the new yellow “Black Lives Matter” message on a street near the White House in the center of downtown Washington.

But what the cry means has not always been clear, with the term seeming to sweep in everything from trimming police budgets and redistributing the money to social programs, to completely abolishing police departments.

Alicia Garza, one of the activists who helped found the Black Lives Matter movement, explained the slogan as a call to examine how “we reorganize our priorities, so people don’t have to be in the streets during a national pandemic, a global pandemic.”

“I understand clearly the sentiment and substance behind the slogan,” said Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, though he added that “it’s not a slogan I will use.” Still, he warned against dismissing it outright.

Speaking on the NBC program “Meet the Press,” he reflected on his time as mayor of Newark, when police officers questioned why they were being used to deal with the “fragility and vulnerability of our society.”

“We are overpoliced as a society,” Mr. Booker said. “We are investing in police, which is not solving problems, but making them worse. We should be a more compassionate country, a more loving country.”

“What do you want?” “Justice!” “When do you want it?” “Now!” “What do you want?” “Justice!” “When do you want it?” “Now!” “No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace! No racist police!” “For the mothers! For the mothers! For the mothers.” ”My son wasn’t given a chance to live. I have a chance to live, so I will risk whatever it takes to say his name. Marquis Brown! Say my son’s name: Marquis Brown! Say my son’s name: Marquis Brown! I don’t know all of their names, but what I do tell you is, I stand for all the mothers out here who lost their sons to police brutality.” “How do you spell racist? How do you spell racist?” “Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter!” “Justice! Now! Justice! Now! Justice! It’s unbelievable that we have to keep doing this. It’s embarrassing for our nation. And if we have to be violent, we have to be violent, but I definitely roll with peace. Because they say a Covid virus, you know, is supposed to keep us in the house — that’s not going to keep anyone in the house when people are being killed, when people are being slaughtered.” “Don’t shoot!” “Don’t shoot!” “We appreciate you all, man. We appreciate you all. Get us some water. DJ [unclear], back to action!” “Take your knee off our necks!” “Take your knee off our necks!” “Take your knee off our necks!” “Take your knee off our necks!” “Take your knee off our necks!” “Justice. Systemic racism is really like a knee on the back of your neck.” “Hands up!” “Don’t shoot!” “Hands up!” “Don’t shoot!” “Somebody could steal my car, take my money — I won’t be calling the police. I never have, I never will. Even with my son as a police officer, I need to fix my problems. And my biggest problem now is racism in this country, so that’s why I’m out here trying to fix it.” “Does your son know that you’re here today?” “Umm — I think he does. As a father and a black man, I know that when he’s driving in a car and he’s not in uniform, he will be treated as a black man before he’s treated as the police. Pulling out his badge could be the end of his life because they think it’s a gun, so — and I think he’s aware of that, but I hope he knows. It’s so good to see so many white people here. I’m glad I came.” “If we don’t get it —” “Shut it down!” “If we don’t get it —” “Shut it down!” “If you don’t get it —” “Shut it down!” “Veterans for —” “Black lives matter!” “Veterans for —” “Black lives matter!” “As a group of veterans, we served our country — we will not stop serving our country even after our duties are done. I did serve in the Air Force, and I feel that the world needs to know that veterans are here to support black lives as well. It doesn’t matter to me what else is going on in my life. This is what’s going on in my life.” “Me and my best friend were walking after protesting and then I heard drums. I’m from Zambia. I’m African. I’m a dancer. So once I hear drums, that’s my call. It’s an outlet for me. I still have to hold it together in the workplace and pretend like — not pretend, but not be able to show it, that it’s hurting me and affecting me and my family and those around me.” “Hands up!” “Don’t shoot!” “Don’t shoot!” “Hands up! Don’t shoot! Hands up! Don’t shoot! Hands up! Don’t shoot!”

Attorney General William P. Barr said on Sunday that he believed racism is not a systemic problem in policing, though there is racism more generally in the United States.

“I don’t think that the law enforcement system is systemically racist,” Mr. Barr said on the CBS program “Face the Nation.” “I think we have to recognize that for most of our history, our institutions were explicitly racist.”

Mr. Barr said that he understood why black people in the United States distrust law enforcement, given “the history in this country,” but said that he believed that work done since the 1960s to reform institutions more broadly to make sure they are in sync with laws that ban inequities “is working, and progress has been made.”

While Mr. Barr flatly denied there was systemic racism in policing, he later compared law enforcement to the military, which he said “used to be an explicitly racist institution.”

“Now I think it’s in the vanguard of bringing the races together and providing equal opportunity,” Mr. Barr said. “I think law enforcement has been going through the same process.

Mr. Barr’s comments mirrored those made on Sunday by Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Mr. Wolf said on the ABC program “This Week” that he did not believe “systemic racism” was an issue in American law enforcement, and that tragedies like the death of George Floyd were caused by individual officers abusing their power.

“I think painting law enforcement with the broad brush of systematic racism is really a disservice to the men and women who put on a badge, the uniform, every day — risk their lives every day to protect the American people,” Mr. Wolf said.

Mr. Barr said that he did not support any measures that would reduce the legal immunity police officers are given when someone dies in their custody, because that would “result certainly in police pulling back.”

Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, marched with protesters in Washington toward the White House on Sunday, appearing to be the first Republican senator to join the thousands across the country protesting the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police.

Mr. Romney told a Washington Post reporter that he had joined the march to show that “we need to end violence and brutality, and to make sure that people understand that black lives matter.”

On Capitol Hill and on Twitter, Mr. Romney has been vocal in condemning the circumstances surrounding Mr. Floyd’s death, saying earlier in the week that “the George Floyd murder is abhorrent.”

He had also reflected how his father, George Romney, participated in a Civil Rights march in the 1960s when he was governor of Michigan, quoting him on Twitter and sharing a photo of him at the protest.

Several Republicans have been vocal in condemning the police officers who have ben charged in connection with Mr. Floyd’s death, but few have publicly joined protesters marching across the county.

Earlier in the week, Representative Will Hurd of Texas, the lone black Republican in the House, joined a peaceful protest, marching alongside his constituents and Mr. Floyd’s family.

“What we are showing you today in Houston is that we can be outraged by a black man getting murdered in police custody,” Mr. Hurd, who is retiring, said in a video on Twitter. “We can be united for change in our society, and we can be thankful that law enforcement is enabling our first amendment rights.”

Protests in the district on Sunday were smaller and overwhelmingly peaceful through the evening, in contrast to events from earlier in the week.

Though members of the National Guard continued to block off streets leading to the White House, there was less law enforcement near the White House late into the evening, as protesters demonstrated and barbecued in front of St. John’s church.

Makeda Jahnesta Marley, Bob Marley’s daughter, sang “Redemption Song” to a crowd near 16th Street, where protesters had painted “Defund the Police” alongside the city commissioned “Black Lives Matter” mural.

Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia and an icon of the civil rights movement, joined protesters and Mayor Muriel Bowser on Sunday.

Mr. Lewis paused atop the “Black Lives Matter” mural that spans blocks.

Dwayne Haskins Jr., quarterback for the Washington Redskins, also joined in the afternoon on Sunday and tweeted about the “peaceful protest.”

“It’s about time to take a risk and make the change,” said Les Alma, who came to protest for the first time on Sunday, of President Trump and legislators. “Today’s a good start.”

Lafayette Square, where demonstrators were cleared out by the National Guard on Monday, remained fenced off. The view of the White House through the fence was obscured by a large Black Lives Matter banner, as well as hundreds of smaller signs taped to the fence, which called for unity and justice for victims of police brutality.

In dozens of cities, people came out to protest racism and police brutality. Here’s what Times photographers saw:

The march in Hollywood, starting in the shadow of the iconic Capitol Records building, had been promoted widely leading up to Sunday afternoon.

Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, along with BLD PWR, organized the protest along with the rapper YG.

So at around 4 p.m., thousands and thousands of Angelenos, of all ages and ethnicities, most walking, but some on bikes, in Mercedes and some in the beds of old trucks, filled the streets lined by the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

At the Hollywood and Vine Los Angeles Metro station, a Red Line train heading north was crowded at around 4 p.m. There was a coiled, quiet energy in one of the cars, and when the train stopped, protesters poured out into the bright Hollywood sunshine.

Outside, thousands of people marched down Vine Street. The atmosphere felt a little like a street festival.

Music blasted and people with megaphones chanted “No justice, no peace,” and people in an open-sided food truck tossed snacks into the crowd.

“That’s Machine Gun Kelly,” someone shouted to a friend, as the truck blasted N.W.A. The crowd cheered and sang along. Signs called for defunding the L.AP.D. They showed the names of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, as well as Tamir Rice.

Many expressed solidarity with black Americans from other marginalized groups: “Latinx for Black Lives,” several signs said. “Asians for BLM” read another.

A police presence was hard to spot, except for a helicopter that circled overhead. Tatianna Marin, 23, and Jarrion Harris, 32, stood by the train station waiting for a friend.

They said it was their first day out protesting — the fear of getting sick, and the knowledge that the coronavirus was disproportionately hitting people of color like themselves, made them wary. But in the end, Mr. Harris said, “I felt like I just had to be here.”

Mr. Harris said that as a black man, the protests felt personal but also bigger than himself. “I’m definitely not out here because I think Covid-19 has gone into the shadows,” he said. “It’s worth the risk. People fought for me before I was even born. They faced bullets.”

“All loud voices come to the front!”

That call from a woman leading the demonstration set thousands of protesters in motion on Sunday, marching through Manhattan from their assembly point in Union Square to protest police violence.

As they headed west on 14th Street, the protesters invoked the names of black people killed by police officers in Louisville and Minneapolis: “Breonna Taylor, say her name!” “Say his name, George Floyd!”

It was one of several marches and protests that are taking place across New York City on Sunday. Earlier, Mayor Bill de Blasio had announced that he was canceling the curfew that he imposed on Monday.

As of 7 p.m. on Sunday, there were no reports of major confrontations or mass arrests as the protests continued peacefully.

For Divya Gunasekaran, 31, who works in the technology division at a New York City hospital, the Union Square march was her sixth protest since Mr. Floyd was killed.

“The curfew never should have been put in place,” Ms. Gunasekaran said. “He’s patting himself on the back, but never acknowledged that the police have contributed to the violence we’ve seen during the protests.”

Ms. Gunasekaran said she had been calling and emailing members of the City Council, asking them to redirect money from policing to youth, health and homeless services.

“A lot of those programs have been completely slashed while the N.Y.P.D. has been untouched,” she said. “We need social services more than ever.”

Natasha Campbell, a medical assistant from East Flatbush, Brooklyn, emerged from an urgent care clinic on 14th Street wearing a white hazmat suit and an N95 mask. When she raised her fist in solidarity with the protesters, they erupted in cheers and applause.

Ms. Campbell, who is black, recalled being in the streets of her neighborhood in 2013 to protest the killing by police officers of a black teenager, Kimani Gray. Back then, the protesters were overwhelmingly black, she said. On Sunday, she marveled at the diversity of the marching crowd.

“Before, I was was so angry, seeing the video” of Mr. Floyd’s killing, she said. “But seeing everyone taking a stand — it’s not just black people. I feel warmth. I feel love. I feel unity.”

The protest reached Columbus Circle just before 4 p.m. As the demonstrators approached the Trump International Hotel and Tower there, they turned their anger to the president, yelling, “Vote him out!” The protesters collectively took a knee and raised their fists, observing a minute of silence before rising and marching up Central Park West.

In Spokane, the second largest city in the state of Washington, thousands of demonstrators gathered in Riverfront Park, the site of the 1974 World’s Fair.

Unlike a similar demonstration last week which resulted in violence, looting and arrests in Spokane, the Sunday gathering was largely peaceful. Uniformed police weren’t visible in the crowd, but a contingent of riot-equipped officers guarded the Spokane County Courthouse and adjoining Public Safety Building which serves as headquarters for both the Spokane Police Department and Spokane County Sheriff’s Office.

Most of the demonstrators appeared to be young and the majority were wearing masks.

An ad hoc group called “Spokane Street Medics,” composed of volunteer physicians, nurses and emergency aid workers, handed out free masks.

Marcus Shadwick, a 23-year-old African-American, said he considers it unfortunate that the pandemic lurks in the background of the Black Lives Matter movement, which he supports. He wasn’t wearing a mask, saying he left his at home. “I do feel though that people should be wearing masks.” He hoped to get a giveaway mask.

“I think these protests are bigger than any virus,” Mr. Shadwick said. “These protests are a cure for a virus that’s been going on for 400 years,” he said, referring to systemic racism.

His twin brother, Marquis Shadwick, standing nearby, said he showed up also without a mask “just to get my voice heard” and to speak out against “a corrupt police system and people not understanding that racism exists.”

Jshanelle Brown said she showed up because she has 10 siblings, including four brothers who are young black men who, she said, fear police.

“I have watched their interaction with police here in Spokane,” she said, explaining that she believes law enforcement officers frequently target young black men.

“They go straight to someone if the pigment of their skin is dark,” she said. “I guess they see people of color as being aggressive, the threat, the harm, and that’s unacceptable to me,” the 24-year-old social worker said.

John Parks, a 55-year-old public-school teacher, said racism and the coronavirus are “both threats to our society.”

“This is the most important pandemic to fight right now, and that’s why I’m here,” he said of the anti-racism rally.

As the crowd gathered for a march across the city’s landmark Monroe Street Bridge, the demonstrators chanted, “No justice. No peace. Defund the police.”

Joseph R. Biden Jr. plans to travel on Monday to Houston to meet with the family of George Floyd and offer his condolences.

Mr. Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, will also record a video message for Mr. Floyd’s funeral service on Tuesday, according to an aide. Mr. Biden is not expected to attend the service; given his Secret Service protection, there were concerns about the disruption his presence might create, according to people familiar with the matter.

Mr. Biden’s trip to Texas is his first beyond his home state of Delaware and nearby Philadelphia in almost three months. It comes as Mr. Biden seeks to draw a sharp contrast with President Trump over race, leadership and character at a moment of extraordinary national unrest.

Mr. Biden, the former vice president, has spoken out passionately about the need to heal racial divisions in the country, and he has pushed for several measures to overhaul policing.

He has also been sharply critical of Mr. Trump, who has tried to paint himself as a “law and order” president. Mr. Trump has called demonstrators “thugs” and “terrorists,” and threatened last week to deploy the military to overpower them.

On the ground, the passion and determination driving thousands to take to the streets day after day are palpable. When viewed from above, the individual fades as the crowd comes into focus. Images from the 12th day of national protests offer a bird’s-eye view of the expressions of solidarity.

Images from Saturday, June 6, show the scale of the protests against police brutality and racism, following the death of George Floyd.

A statue of a Confederate general was pulled down from its pedestal Saturday night during demonstrations in Richmond, Va., as monuments to the Confederacy continue to draw the ire of protesters who see them as enduring symbols of white supremacy.

The statue of William Carter Wickham, a cavalry commander, was erected in Monroe Park in 1891. Videos taken on Saturday night showed the statue, with ropes attached, lying on the ground near its pedestal, which was marked with graffiti.

It was not immediately clear whether the people who toppled the statue were protesters. Demonstrations at the park and throughout the city were otherwise peaceful, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported.

Confederate statues and monuments in Norfolk, Va., Raleigh, N.C., and Birmingham, Ala., among other places, have also been targeted. Some have been defaced, and protesters have tried to topple others.

Tensions over the monuments have run particularly high in Richmond, which was the capital of the Confederacy. Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia said last week that the city’s Robert E. Lee statue would be removed, and Mayor Levar Stoney said he would propose an ordinance to remove several other monuments.

A Confederate statue in Alexandria, Va., that had been scheduled for removal next month was taken down last week.

Monuments to white supremacists have also attracted ire overseas. A statue of Edward Colson, a 17th century slave trader and politician, was toppled on Sunday by protesters in Bristol, England.

“No justice! No peace!” “No justice! No peace!” “When I say black lives, you say matter!” “Black lives!” “Matter!” “Black lives!” “Matter!”

The global protests denouncing racism and police brutality showed no sign of slowing down this weekend, with crowds gathering on Sunday in Rome, London, Madrid, Barcelona and other cities.

Chanting “Black lives matter” and “No justice, no peace,” thousands of people swelled the Piazza del Popolo in Rome to protest racism in the United States and in Italy.

“As many of you know, there is a very serious problem with state-condoned violence” in the United States, Fatimah Provillon, a New Jersey native who has lived in Rome for 13 years, told the crowd of mostly young Italians. “But it’s not just a U.S. problem — it’s happening all over the world.”

Thousands of people filled the streets outside the U.S. Embassy in London on Sunday, chanting George Floyd’s name and “Black lives matter,” “Let us live” and “No justice, no peace.” And when the protesters took to their knees, a protest gesture often seen in anti-racism campaigns, cries were heard of “The U.K. is not innocent.”

“We came to protest the injustice of the justice system and the deaths and killings of black people everywhere,” said Iyanah Gordon, one of a group of 18-year-old friends from South London who were at the protest. “Injustices like George Floyd’s death happen here.”

Jamal Marcano, 23, from West London, said he had been stopped by the police recently because of racial profiling. “In the U.S. the racism is more blatant, in the U.K. it is more subtle,” he said.

London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, also offered support to the weekend’s demonstrations, writing on Twitter on Sunday: “Londoners of all ages, races and backgrounds joined millions of people around the world yesterday to come together peacefully. I stand with you.”

A few thousand protesters gathered on Sunday in Spain’s two largest cities — Madrid and Barcelona — chanting “I can’t breathe” and calling for an end to police racism. Those who gathered in Madrid did so in defiance of an order from the authorities, who have permitted gatherings only if they are limited to 200 participants because of the coronavirus.

The Madrid protest started near the U.S. embassy but soon spread, and turned instead into a march that ended at the Puerta del Sol, a main square in the heart of the Spanish capital. In Barcelona, about 3,000 demonstrators took over Sant Jaume square, home to the regional government and the city administration. Many held up photos of Mr. Floyd, as well as signs reading “Black Lives Matter” and “Black is Beautiful.”

In Rome, Karima 2G, an Italian singer of Liberian descent who hosted the protest, spoke of “solidarity with African-Americans” even as migrants from Africa struggle to get a footing in Italy and across Europe.

She said in an interview later that she was pleased to see a big turnout in Italy, where children of residents of African descent are often not considered Italian.

“That’s a form of racism, too,” she said.

What do you want? Justice! When do you want it? Now! What do you want? Justice! When do you want it? Now! Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Justice! Now! Justice! Now! Justice! Now! Justice! Now! If we don’t get it — shut it down! If you don’t get it — shut it down! If you don’t get it — shut it down! No justice — No peace! No justice — No peace! No racist police! For the mothers! For the mothers! For the mothers. For the mothers. No justice, no peace. We appreciate y’all, man. We appreciate y’all. Get us some water. D.J. [unclear] ... back to action! It’s been a lot of crazy things going on in the last week. Say hello to the person next to you. We swap! Here at the White House. Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter!

Demonstrations across the United States, which began as spontaneous eruptions of outrage after the death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police less than two weeks ago, appeared to have cohered by Saturday into a nationwide movement protesting systemic racism.

Thousands marched in big cities like New York and Seattle, and tighter groups in small towns like Vidor, Texas; Havre, Mont.; and Marion, Ohio, denouncing a broken law enforcement system marked by racial injustice.

The outpouring of activism came at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has underscored many deep inequities in society, and has also removed competition for the public’s attention by disrupting work, school and entertainment.

One of the largest protests was in the nation’s capital, where new fences, concrete barriers and a force of unidentifiable guards have shrouded the White House, projecting a new symbolism of militarized defensiveness rather than openness and democracy.

A multiethnic, multigenerational crowd of thousands of protesters converged there, at the mouth of Lafayette Square. Demonstrators on foot and bicycle headed to the freshly painted Black Lives Matter mural on the main thoroughfare, passing cars with “BLM” and “Stop Killing Us” written on their rear windows. Later, they also passed people sipping cocktails at a few upscale restaurants open for outdoor dining.

At times, it felt as if the entire city had emptied into downtown Washington as the numbers swelled to high for the two weeks. Lines of protesters — often but not always masked against the virus — snaked their way through side streets, while others converged in nearby parks.

By early evening, 16th Street had the feel of a street fair. Ice cream trucks idled on the side of the road, parents rolled tired children in strollers, people played guitars and harmonicas. Music was playing out of the back of cars. Some people danced.

Protesters also gathered in the once predominantly black neighborhoods of U Street and Columbia Heights, north of the White House. In Meridian Hill Park, which locals call Malcolm X Park, a large crowd gathered to chant, “No justice, no peace.”

Just down the street, the intersection of 14th and U Streets was filled with protesters who had gathered to listen to D.J.s and musicians play go-go music, a type of funk music recently designated the official music of the district. The chanting crowd paused to listen to a woman sing “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” which black Americans have embraced for more than a century as an anthem of liberation.

Although Saturday’s demonstrations were largely peaceful, President Trump continued to hammer home a familiar message.

“LAW & ORDER!” he wrote on Twitter on Saturday evening.

Here are highlights of some of the larger protests around the country.

In New York, nearly a thousand people streamed into Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn, and several thousand gathered near Central Park in Manhattan. Some danced and others played music, and chants of “Whose streets? Our streets!” rang out even as the clouds broke and a downpour soaked the crowds. Protesters continued marching more than three hours after curfew, mostly in Brooklyn. Here’s the latest.

In Seattle, a demonstration organized by health care workers drew thousands who walked from Harborview Medical Center to City Hall. Many wore scrubs and lab coats and carried signs that read, “Black Health Matters” and “Racism Is a Public Health Emergency.”

Protesters in San Francisco briefly stopped traffic on the Golden Gate Bridge in one of two dozen demonstrations planned for the San Francisco Bay Area this weekend. “This is the awakening of America,” said one protester, Nate Payne, who was clad in a gold San Francisco 49ers jacket and holding a cutout of the team’s former quarterback, Colin Kaepernick, kneeling.

In Los Angeles, just south of the University of Southern California campus and the historic core of the city’s black community, a procession of marchers decked out in Trojan cardinal and led by the U.S.C. Black Student Assembly completed a three-mile walk around the campus. Members of the Mujeres Activas en Letras y Cambio Social, a Latina and Native American activist group, led a protest walk around At California State University, Los Angeles.

In Philadelphia, thousands of people filled the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, marching from the Philadelphia Museum of Art to City Hall, with some demanding that the city cut the Police Department budget by at least 10 percent.

Jacob Frey, we have a yes or no question for you. Yes or no: Will you commit to defunding Minneapolis Police Department? What did I say? We don’t want no more police. Is that clear? We don’t want people with guns toting around in our community shooting us down. You haven’t answered. It is a yes or a no. It is a yes or a no. Will you defund the Minneapolis Police Department? All right, be quiet, you all. Be quiet. Because it’s important that we actually hear this. It’s important that we hear this because if you all don’t know, he’s up for re-election next year. [cheering] He’s up for re-election next year. And if he says no, guess what the [expletive] we’re going to do next year. What did you say? Louder, one more time. All right! You’re wasting our time. Get the [expletive] out of here. Get the [expletive] out. Go home, Jacob. Go home. Go home, Jacob. Go home. Go home, Jacob. Go home. Shame, shame, shame.

It was a moment reminiscent of the walk of shame from “Game of Thrones.”

And for Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis, a 38-year-old civil rights lawyer who swept into office in 2018 on promises to fix the relationship between the community and the police, it was all too real.

Passing through a sea of protesters on Saturday, he was met with cries of “Go home, Jacob, go home!” and “Shame! Shame!” after he declined to commit to defunding the city’s police department. As he walked away, the crowd continued chanting, “Shame! Shame!”

The scene, which ricocheted across social media, reflected the intense pressure protesters nationwide are putting on elected officials to commit to sweeping changes in the nation’s law enforcement system after the death of George Floyd last month.

Across the country, calls to defund, downsize or abolish police departments have gained new traction since Mr. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died after a white police officer in Minneapolis pressed a knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes.

Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles said on Wednesday that he would cut as much as $150 million from a planned increase in the police budget. And in New York, Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, and Daniel Dromm, a council member from Queens, vowed even before the latest protests to cut the Police Department’s $6 billion budget.

In Minneapolis, at least four members of the City Council have called for dismantling the Police Department, where four former officers have been charged in the death of Mr. Floyd.

“And when we’re done, we’re not simply gonna glue it back together,” Jeremiah Ellison, a member of the City Council, said on Twitter this week. “We are going to dramatically rethink how we approach public safety and emergency response.”

Anti-racism demonstrations unfolded not only in major cities across the United States, but also in smaller towns and largely rural areas.

More than 100 people gathered on Saturday for a protest against racism in Vidor, Texas, a town about 10,000 that has a history of Ku Klux Klan and white supremacist activity. The demonstrators, many holding “Black Lives Matter” signs, stood in a grassy area, chanting, “I can’t breathe!” and “No justice, no peace!”

Michael Cooper, the president of the N.A.A.C.P. chapter in nearby Beaumont, addressed the gathering and emphasized that the protest was peaceful. “Just like Waco, Texas is now known for something else, Vidor, Texas, will now be known for love!” he declared to cheers, according to video from KFDM.

Vidor, which is near the Louisiana border, has been the site of Klan rallies as well as a major fight over integration in the early 1990s, when two black men trying to desegregate a housing project moved out because of harassment and intimidation.

On Saturday, video posted on Twitter by a local reporter showed a number of white men with guns standing near the demonstration. The said they were there to protect a nearby veterans memorial, according to the reporter, Jordan James of 12NewsNow.

Other towns where protests were held on Saturday included Marion, Ohio; Simi Valley, Calif.; Richmond, Ky.; Washington, Pa.; Athens, Ga.; and Ephrata, Pa. Protesters also took to the streets of Huntsville, Texas, just blocks from the state’s execution chamber.

In recent days, Havre, Mont.; Garden City, Kan.; and Harvard, Neb., have all had protests.

On Saturday morning, crowds converged in Alpine, Texas, to support the Black Lives Matter movement.

The scene in Alpine, which has a population of about 6,000 and is in the Big Bend region of Texas near the border with Mexico, surprised some local observers.

Hundreds of protesters walked through the streets, hoisting Black Lives Matter placards and the flags of the United States, Mexico and Texas, before arriving at the Brewster County courthouse.

“Pretty sure this is the largest turnout for a protest I’ve ever seen in the Big Bend region, equal to or bigger than the anti-pipeline protests from a few years ago,” Travis Bubenik, a journalist based in West Texas, said on Twitter.

Scrutiny of the police in Alpine has been growing in recent days amid an uproar over racist tweets attributed to Devon Portillo, a candidate for Brewster County sheriff. Mr. Portillo contended that his Twitter account had been infiltrated and that he was not to blame for the tweets, according to local media reports. His account has since been deactivated.

“My generation, we did a lot of good, but we stagnated,” Andy Ramos, 72, the mayor of Alpine, told protesters. “We need a push in the butt and you guys are the ones who have to do it. You have to bring social change to this world.”

Starkville, a town of 26,000 in Mississippi, also had its own protest on Saturday. Participants said that turnout numbered well into the hundreds.

Ariana Sirgew, a student at Mississippi State University, said it was the first time she saw a protest in Starkville, the town where the university is based. She said she was moved by a discussion at the protest of the 8 minutes and 46 seconds during which George Floyd died at the hands of the police in Minneapolis.

“Everyone felt it in their soul,” said Ms. Sirgew.

Come onto me, at rest. Brother George, time for you to get to rest. Black power. Black power. Black power. [cheering] Let justice flow like a mighty stream. Let truth stand tall like the majestic oak. Let hope be as broad as the distant horizon. Let kindness rain like a summer shower.

The body of George Floyd lay in a plush blue coffin, dressed in a tan suit and brown tie. His face bore a serene and peaceful look.

Inside a Free Will Baptist church in tiny Raeford, N.C., Mr. Floyd’s body had been returned to the state of his birth for a public viewing on Saturday. His coffin was surrounded by floral arrangements, left by mourners despite a request from his family for no flowers.

One by one, peeling off from two lines of hundreds of people, each lined up in the searing morning sun, mourners filed past the coffin in silence. Some murmured prayers. Others whispered softly, “God bless,” or simply, “Peace, brother.”

Church officials in black suits and white shirts handed out bottles of water, gently urging people to move quickly so that others in the growing lines outside would have an opportunity to pay their respects. One minister filtered slowly through the crowd, telling mourners, “I know it’s hot, but bless you for coming out.”

The crowd filed past a phalanx of State Highway Patrol vehicles and police officers at the church parking lot entrance. The mood was serene, with only short, occasional chants: “Say his name — George Floyd!” “No justice, no peace!”

It was church officials and ushers, not police officers, who shut down the chants. The family had requested that there be no demonstrations or protests, said Sheriff Hubert A. Peterkin of Hoke County, who helped the family organize the viewing.

At a private memorial service later in the day, Sheriff Peterkin earned a standing ovation when he said that the nation’s police officers “are part of the problem” and, looking directly at Mr. Floyd’s family, that ingrained racism had led to Mr. Floyd’s death.

“If there were four brothers that threw a police officer on the ground and one of them put his knee on that officer’s neck and killed him on a video,” there would be a “national manhunt,” said the sheriff, who is black.

More than 300 mourners attended the private service in Raeford, about 25 miles west of Fayetteville, N.C., where Mr. Floyd was born. A number of family members, many dressed in white, rose to clap and to sing hymns. But it was Sheriff Peterkin’s remarks that drew the loudest response in a service that featured soaring gospel music and fiery sermons.

Sheriff Peterkin said he had dreamed of being a police officer since he was 10 years old. But because of Mr. Floyd’s death and the killings of other black men in police custody, “that dream is now turning into a nightmare,” he said.

“If I deny all the wrong that law enforcement is doing today, I am denying the color of my skin,” Sheriff Peterkin said. “I am a black man first, and then law enforcement.”

The Rev. Dr. Christopher D. Stackhouse said the video of Mr. Floyd’s death lasted eight minutes and 46 seconds, but that “it was 401 years in the making” — a reference to the history of slavery in America.

“They killed him in broad daylight,” the minister said. “George Floyd’s family had to watch him die.”

Police Departments across the United States are re-examining their use-of-force policies as protesters continue to express outrage over such tactics in the wake of George Floyd’s death as Democrats in Congress plan expansive legislation to address police brutality and racial bias.

In Minneapolis, where the police use force against blacks far more often than against whites, the authorities said on Friday that they were immediately banning the use of chokeholds and strangleholds. Such tactics were previously reserved for life-or-death situations for officers.

City officials also said officers would be required to intervene and report any use of unauthorized force, a move that comes after nearly two weeks of protests over the death of Mr. Floyd, a black man whom a white Minneapolis police officer pinned under his knee for nearly nine minutes.

On the West Coast, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California called on Friday for the removal of neck restraints from the state’s police training programs. And Seattle’s police chief, Carmen Best, said she was banning the use of tear gas on protesters for at least 30 days and calling for a review of the department’s crowd control tactics.

In New Mexico, the Las Cruces Police Department said it was prohibiting the neck restraint technique. The authorities in the city also said on Friday that an officer involved in the killing of a man who fled from a traffic stop in late February would be fired and charged with involuntary manslaughter. Officers tased the man, Antonio Valenzuela, 40, twice as he ran away after being pulled over. Officer Christopher Smelser then used a chokehold technique on him.

And in Colorado, where legislation to ban the use of chokeholds by law enforcement was introduced this week, a federal judge in Denver issued a temporary restraining order on Friday to limit officers’ ability to fire rubber bullets or use tear gas on protesters.

“No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace!” “I can’t breathe! I can’t breathe!” “Black lives matter!” “No justice, no peace!” “Justice! Justice!” “Justice!” “Justice!” “Justice!” “Justice!”

Protests over the death of George Floyd were held in cities around world on Saturday.

Thousands gathered in Britain, France and Germany, following marches earlier in the day that drew thousands in cities like Tokyo and Sydney. And while many of the global protests were inspired by the unrest in the United States, they have also pointed to issues of racism and police brutality at home.

Protesters in central London filled Parliament Square and the surrounding streets despite cold weather and spitting rain.

Most wore wearing face masks, but their collective chants were loud and clear: “George Floyd,” “Black Lives Matter” and “No justice, no peace.”

Silence fell for about a minute as everyone knelt on the wet ground. Most raised fists in the air.

In Paris, the authorities barred gatherings in front of the U.S. Embassy, but thousands protested there anyway in the late afternoon, as well as near the Eiffel Tower, echoing a protest on Wednesday that drew nearly 20,000 people to remember Adama Traoré, a Frenchman who died in police custody in 2016.

In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel called the killing of Mr. Floyd “terrible” and “racist.” “We know ourselves that we know something of racism here, and have a lot to do regarding that — I would like to say that clearly,” she said in an interview with the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle. “But I trust in the power of democracy in the United States, that they will be able to come through this difficult situation.”

And in cities and towns across Australia on Saturday, tens of thousands rallied in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, despite a warning from Prime Minister Scott Morrison that large gatherings could harm efforts to control the pandemic.

Masked protesters, angry in part over the government’s treatment of Aboriginal people, shouted, “I can’t breathe,” and held signs saying “How many more?” and “Australia is not innocent.” The intensity, scale and scope of the demonstrations seemed to dwarf anything the country had seen on the issue of race in years.

There have been protests all week in Tampa, Orlando and Tallahassee. And in South Florida, better known as a sunny playground than as hotbed of political activism, protests filled the entire day on Saturday.

For starters, a large group of protesters marched downtown under palm trees and blooming royal poincianas to the Miami-Dade County Courthouse to pray. In the early afternoon, several dozen gathered across the street from Trump National Doral, the president’s resort, blaring salsa. “Trump you’re a racist,” one sign read.

Protesters marched in the rain in Tampa, huddled in a West Palm Beach park and chanted to take down Confederate statues in Jacksonville.

In the evening, hundreds marched along Biscayne Boulevard in downtown Miami. The crowd was nearly equal parts black, white and Hispanic, young and old, with more than a few families.

“We’re not here to break nothing,” Jonni Gartrelle said, yelling through a bullhorn as people gathered at the Torch of Friendship monument, a 1960 beacon for Caribbean and Latin American immigrants.

“It’s not just the racist institutions that we’re fighting,” he said later in an interview. “It’s the apathy of the people,” he said. “People think racism is like a rock in a boat that you can throw overboard and fix it, but it’s really a hole in the boat that has to be fixed.”

As she walked up the boulevard, Martha Julme recalled that when her family lived in a mostly white suburb of Fort Lauderdale, the police would stop her father on his way home and ask whether he lived in the neighborhood. She also remembered back to when a boy on her school bus called her a racial epithet.

“And I hit him,” she said. “I got suspended for 10 days and nothing happened to him.” The principal, Ms. Julme said, had said it was OK for the boy to use the slur.

“I’m scared when I see a cop and I’m scared when I see a white person,” she said. “I just don’t want to fear when I see a cop or a white person.”

“Move back!” “Hey!” [gasps] “He is bleeding!” “Bleeding out his ears, bleeding out of his ears.” “Call a medic! Call a medic!” “He’s bleeding out of his ear.” “Get a medic.” “What the [expletive] you walking up on me?” [unclear] “Oh [expletive].” “Back up. Back up. Get off the steps, let’s go, get back. Get back!” “Better get an ambulance for him.” “He’s — there — we have EMT on scene.”

Two Buffalo police officers were arraigned Saturday morning on charges of assault in the second degree for pushing a 75-year-old man who was protesting outside City Hall on Thursday night, according to the Erie County District Attorney.

“We had two of our police officers who crossed the line,” District Attorney John J. Flynn told reporters after the arraignment in Buffalo City Court. “My job is to prosecute those who have violated the law, plain and simple. And I believe, and I’m alleging, that these two officers violated the law.”

Prosecutors identified the officers as Aaron Torglaski, 39, and Robert McCabe, 32. They were arraigned before Judge Craig D. Hannah, who released the men on their personal recognizance.

The felony charges were filed after a widely viewed video showed two police officers appearing to shove Martin Gugino, who has been identified as an activist and a member of the Western New York Peace Center. Mr. Gugino approached the officers in Niagara Square and was shoved. He staggered backward and landed hard on the ground. Blood immediately began leaking out of his ear.

Mr. Flynn said that if Mr. Gugino was violating curfew and refused to move, officers should have moved to arrest him.

“You don’t take a baton and shove him,” he said, noting the other officer shoved Mr. Gugino with his right hand, knocking him down. “That’s what you don’t do. You properly arrest him if he was committing a crime.”

Mr. Flynn said Mr. Gugino is still hospitalized and remained in serious condition.

Mr. Gugino’s age makes the assault charges a felony, rather than a misdemeanor. If convicted, the officers face up to seven years in prison.

Outside the courthouse, at least 100 people, most of them white men, stood together, some holding the American flag. Many were armed and appeared to be in police uniform. Others wore T-shirts that said “BPD Strong.”

At one point, one of them hoisted up an umbrella in an apparent attempt to block a television camera from filming them.

A handful of counterprotesters showed up with megaphones, chanting “Support good cops, not bad cops.”

One counterprotester chanted, “don’t push old men.” The crowd of police supporters stared back at them but remained peaceful.

When the officers left, the crowd erupted in applause and cheers.

As Americans gather by the thousands to protest the death of George Floyd, scientists have warned that the crowded events could contribute to the spread of the coronavirus. Already, there are signs that those fears were well-placed.

Though no city has yet attributed a major outbreak to the protests, individual demonstrators in several places have contracted the virus, including in Lawrence, Kan., where someone who attended a protest last weekend tested positive on Friday. That person did not wear a mask while protesting, local officials said.

“Similar to what we would ask anyone who goes out in public right now, we are asking anyone who attended the recent protest to self-monitor for Covid-19 symptoms and isolate if they become sick,” Sonia Jordan of the local health department said in a statement.

Across the country, similar tales are emerging. Although the United States has passed a peak in infections and deaths, the virus remains a persistent threat. Around 20,000 new cases are being identified across the country on most days, and about 1,000 new deaths are being announced.

In Athens, Ga., a local commissioner who attended a protest said that she had tested positive. “I am asymptomatic but infectious,” Commissioner Mariah Parker wrote on Facebook. “If you spoke on Sunday or were near me in the crowd, please get tested.”

In Columbus, Ohio, health officials said someone who protested there on May 27 had later tested positive.

And in Oklahoma, a college football player who demonstrated said that he had later tested positive for the virus. “After attending a protest in Tulsa AND being well protective of myself, I have tested positive for COVID-19,” Amen Ogbongbemiga, a linebacker at Oklahoma State University, wrote on Twitter. “Please, if you are going to protest, take care of yourself and stay safe.”

It could be several days, or even weeks, before it is known whether any major clusters emerge from the protests.

“As people gather in large crowds with varying degrees of social distancing,” Dr. Ngozi Ezike, the Illinois Department of Public Health’s director, said in a statement, “there is cause for concern about Covid-19 spread and outbreaks, especially if masks were not worn universally.”

Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a radio interview on Friday that he was “very concerned” that gatherings of any kind were “a perfect setup for the spread of the virus in the sense of creating these blips that might turn into some surges.

Stan Wischnowski, the top editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer, resigned on Saturday, days after a walkout by dozens of staff members over a headline on an architectural critic’s column about the effects of civil unrest on the city’s buildings that read “Buildings Matter, Too.”

The headline, published with the article on Tuesday, played on the slogan “Black Lives Matter,” a rallying cry for activists protesting police violence against blacks, particularly since the death of George Floyd last month.

Lisa Hughes, the publisher of The Inquirer, said in a memo to the staff on Saturday that she had accepted Mr. Wischnowski’s decision to step down after 10 years across two stints as the leader of one of the country’s largest newsrooms.

The day after the Inquirer column was published, the paper’s top editors, including Mr. Wischnowski, issued an apology that appeared on its website.

“The Philadelphia Inquirer published a headline in Tuesday’s edition that was deeply offensive,” the editors wrote. “We should not have printed it. We’re sorry, and regret that we did. We also know that an apology on its own is not sufficient.”

“The headline offensively riffed on the Black Lives Matter movement, and suggested an equivalence between the loss of buildings and the lives of black Americans,” the apology continued. “That is unacceptable.”

Staff members, working remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic, convened for a regularly scheduled videoconference that day. It turned into an hourslong discussion of newsroom diversity, pay inequity and other issues, said Diane Mastrull, a weekend editor and the president of the NewsGuild of Greater Philadelphia union.

America’s Reckoning on Racism Spreads Beyond Policing,"This briefing has ended.

[cheering] [cheering] [drums and chanting] ♫ “Na na na na, hey hey, goodbye ...” ♫ “Let’s go!” [drums] “They knocked it down.” “Why?” “We don’t condone any vandalism here in the city of Boston. And that needs to stop. We are going to be taking the statue down this morning, putting into storage to assess the damage of the statue. And given the conversations that we’re certainly having right now in our city of Boston and throughout the country, we’re also going to take time to assess the historic meaning of the statue.”

Protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis have quickly given rise to a vast American reckoning with racism, as a backlash against entrenched inequality reverberates across society, from the upper echelons of corporations and media organizations to the pages of the dictionary.

The fallout has been swift and fierce.

By Wednesday, the chief executive of CrossFit had resigned after speaking belligerently about race and racism on a company call. Thousands of researchers across the country went on strike, forgoing research, classes, meetings and other work to instead spend the day calling for actions to protect the lives of black people. And Merriam-Webster said it would expand its dictionary definition of racism to address systemic bias.

The changes come as protesters across the country continue to cry out for racial justice and accountability with a visceral force.

In Richmond, Va., protesters ripped down a statue of the explorer and colonizer Christopher Columbus overnight and threw it into a lake. In Boston, a similar statue was beheaded. Across the country, at least 10 monuments to Confederates or other controversial historical figures have been removed, and people have challenged similar monuments in more than 20 cities.

The demand for consequences reflects a considerable shift in public opinion, as Congress races to address police accountability and racial bias in law enforcement during a pivotal election year. The House Judiciary Committee heard testimony on Wednesday from a brother of Mr. Floyd, who spoke out against the repeated police killings of black Americans and urged lawmakers to “make it stop.”

Almost no industry has been immune from the fallout.

In Minneapolis, the police chief, Medaria Arradondo, said he would no longer engage in contract negotiations with the police union, as officials across the country increasingly defy influential police and corrections groups.

As major sports grapple with how to respond to the protests — and how much freedom to allow athletes to speak out — NASCAR banned the Confederate battle flag from its races, many of them in the South. Last week, the National Football League commissioner, Roger Goodell, said the league had been wrong to discourage political protest by its players.

Facing anger from employees, Adidas made a series of concessions, including a pledge that 30 percent of the people it hired would be black or Latino, but critics remain upset that the company has not formally acknowledged discrimination or apologized.

After a University of Chicago economist, Harald Uhlig, criticized and belittled black protesters, a group of economists is demanding his ouster as editor of a top academic publication in the field, the Journal of Political Economy.

Authors and book publishing employees are speaking publicly about pay disparities in an overwhelmingly white industry under the hashtag #PublishingPaidMe.

Among newspapers, whose newsrooms are also disproportionately white, high-ranking editors at The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Philadelphia Inquirer have stepped down or been reassigned in recent days after staff complaints about editorial decisions touching on race and protests.

At The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, two prominent black journalists say that their bosses unfairly kept them from covering protests against racism and police violence, and many of their colleagues are expressing support for them. The top editor, Keith C. Burris, said the newspaper had only acted against journalists who had demonstrated bias.

The Carolina Panthers removed a statue of the football team’s former owner, Jerry Richardson, from outside its stadium in Charlotte, N.C., two years after the N.F.L. fined him for racist comments and sexual harassment. The team called it a matter of public safety, citing the possibility that someone could try to tear the statue down.

In Atlanta, two police officers were fired on Wednesday for their role in dragging two students from their car and shooting them with stun guns while they were stuck in traffic during a May 30 protest against police brutality, bringing to four the number of officers fired as a result of the incident.

History suggests that such intense focus on societal racism is unlikely to last, the Rev. Al Sharpton warned during a eulogy for Mr. Floyd this week. He promised to be back in Minneapolis when the trial for officers start, and to march on Washington “by the tens of thousands” on the anniversary of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech in August.

“We must commit to this family — all of these families, all of his children, grandchildren and all — that until these people pay for what they did, that we’re going to be there with them,” he said. “Because lives like George’s will not matter until somebody pays the cost for taking their lives.”

President Trump renewed his threat to take federal action against local protesters in a late-night tweet on Wednesday, telling government officials in Washington State that they needed to crack down on demonstrators in Seattle.

Mr. Trump said protesters were taunting government leaders, apparently referring to a group that has set up barricades to occupy territory in several blocks of Seattle’s Capitol Hill neighborhood.

“Take back your city NOW,” Mr. Trump wrote in a tweet directed at Mayor Jenny Durkan and Gov. Jay Inslee. “If you don’t do it, I will. This is not a game.”

The president added, “Domestic Terrorists have taken over Seattle, run by Radical Left Democrats, of course. LAW & ORDER!”

Ms. Durkan responded with a tweet of her own: “Make us all safe. Go back to your bunker.”

Police officers and protesters had repeatedly clashed next to the Capitol Hill police station in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd, whose death in Minneapolis police custody sparked nationwide protests. Police officials decided to abandon the station on Monday, boarding it up and allowing protesters to demonstrate in the area without a police presence.

At gatherings on Wednesday, protesters held discussions about their priorities, listening to speeches and poetry while children drew with chalk on the street. There was no violence or looting, and the city’s fire chief wandered around the area talking with protesters about their needs and a collaborative path forward.

Mr. Trump had previously discussed deploying active-duty troops to quell the protests in American cities, which experts said would require invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807. That led to blowback from former military leaders who warned that such action could cause the military to lose credibility with Americans.

transcript

I just think about that video, over and over again. Felt like 8 hours and 46 minutes. Hurt seeing my brother plead for his life, watching an officer just put his knee on his neck. Everyday just looking at it, being like anywhere — that’s all people talk about. The rest of my life, that’s all I ever see — somebody looking at the video. Kids have to watch the video. His kids have to watch the video, it just hurts. It’s a lot of people with a lot of pain. My family, they just cry and cry every day. And just ask, “Why? Why?” He pleaded for his life. He said he couldn’t breathe. Nobody cared — nobody!

A day after George Floyd was laid to rest during an impassioned service calling for broad corrections to racial injustice, his brother Philonise Floyd testified on Wednesday before a House hearing on police accountability and racial bias in law enforcement, and offered lawmakers a wrenching plea for change.

“I’m here to ask you to make it stop,” Mr. Floyd told the House Judiciary Committee, describing the agony he felt as he watched the video of his older brother dying while pinned under the knee of a white police officer for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. The elder Mr. Floyd died on May 25 after being arrested over a complaint that he had bought cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill.

“I am asking you, is that what a black man’s life is worth? Twenty dollars?” Mr. Floyd asked members of Congress. “This is 2020. Enough is enough. The people marching in the streets are telling you enough is enough.”

Moved to tears as he recounted how his brother had continued to address the officers detaining him as “sir” as he lay dying, Mr. Floyd later broke down as he detailed the horror his family felt watching the video, saying it felt like “eight hours and 46 minutes.”

“Sitting here, coming to try to tell you all about how I want justice for my brother, I just think about that video over and over again,” Mr. Floyd said. “Every day just looking at it, being anywhere, that’s all people talk about. The rest of my life, that’s all I’ll ever see.”

Anybody “with a heart,” he continued, would know that how his brother was treated was wrong: “You don’t do that to a human being, you don’t even do that to an animal.”

After delivering his testimony, Mr. Floyd marched to what is now known as Black Lives Matter Plaza, the area near the White House where federal officers last week used chemical spray to clear demonstrators protesting his brother’s death.

“George Floyd matters,” Mr. Floyd shouted, raising his fist as protesters chanted “Raise ’em up! Raise ’em high!” He was flanked by his lawyer, Benjamin Crump, and Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, Democrat of Texas.

Mr. Floyd was the marquee voice among more than a half-dozen civil rights experts and activists at a hearing called to consider the most expansive federal intervention into law enforcement that lawmakers have proposed in recent memory, which was put forth by Democrats this week.

His testimony added to the mounting sense of urgency on Capitol Hill to overhaul law enforcement practices and address systemic racism in policing.

House Democrats have indicated that they intend to act quickly, with a vote on their legislation planned by the end of the month. Congressional Republicans, faced with a rapid shift in public opinion, are scrambling to coalesce around a legislative response.

Protesters toppled a statue of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War, in Richmond, Va., on Wednesday night, as demonstrators across the country continued to target symbols of white supremacy after the death of George Floyd.

The statue was among a number of prominent Confederate monuments that had stood on Monument Avenue in Richmond, which was once the capital of the Confederacy. Local news reports showed photographs of it lying on the street, with the police nearby before a tow truck carted it away.

It came down one week after Mayor Levar Stoney of Richmond said he would propose an ordinance to remove all four Confederate monuments the city controls along Monument Avenue. Mr. Stoney said he would introduce the bill on July 1, when a new state law goes into effect giving local governments the authority to remove the monuments on their own.

“Richmond is no longer the capital of the Confederacy — it is filled with diversity and love for all — and we need to demonstrate that,” Mr. Stoney said in a statement then.

The statue of Davis was unveiled on June 3, 1907, and depicted him giving the speech in which he resigned from the United States Senate, according to a commission appointed by Mr. Stoney.

“We stand in solidarity with black and brown communities that are tired of being murdered by an out-of-control, militarized and violent police force,” the Richmond Indigenous Society, which took part in the rally, said in a statement on Wednesday.

Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota is summoning a special session of the State Legislature to respond to the dual tragedies of the killing of George Floyd and the coronavirus pandemic.

“This call to a special session is not a call just from me, it’s that primal scream you heard from people on the streets demanding justice, demanding it now, and demanding us step into this moment,” Mr. Walz said on Wednesday, saying police reform and economic aid should be lawmakers’ priorities.

A few hours later, one of the four officers charged in Mr. Floyd’s death, Thomas Lane, posted $750,000 bail and was released, according to a Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office spokesman. The other three remain in custody.

In the session, to begin on Friday, the governor said lawmakers should pass a package of bills that address a list of recommendations from the legislature’s People of Color and Indigenous Caucus. The package includes designating the state attorney general as the primary investigator of police killings; creating a criminal offense of “use of force by law enforcement that leads to severe injury or death”; making it easier to discipline officers; and requiring officers to intervene when their colleagues wrongfully hurt someone.

The governor, who also said he wanted to ban chokeholds, urged legislators to respond to the large crowds of Minnesotans who took to the streets in reaction to the killing of Mr. Floyd.

“Let’s show them that democracy works,” he said. “Let’s show them, in this moment, that what those people did going to the streets makes a difference. Let’s show them that by raising up their voices and asking for change, it can come about.”

Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan said that she had spoken earlier on Wednesday to Valerie Castile, the mother of Philando Castile, who was shot and killed by a police officer in a suburb of St. Paul in 2016, and that Ms. Castile had encouraged the state to make meaningful change following Mr. Floyd’s death.

“She said, ‘God gave you Philando, but Philando wasn’t enough, and now God has given you George Floyd,’” Ms. Flanagan said, recalling their conversation. “We cannot let this opportunity pass. It is too important.”

Also on Wednesday, the chief of the Minneapolis Police Department said he would no longer engage in contract negotiations with the city’s police union.

Chief Medaria Arradondo, an African-American who once sued the Police Department and the city for discrimination, said he would bring in outside advisers to examine how to revamp the police union contract to allow “more flexibility for true reform.” He said the review would cover issues like the role of supervisors and the discipline and arbitration process, a thorny subject raised by protesters in several states.

Activists say the police union in Minneapolis exerts more control than the chief does over police officers’ behavior. Lt. Bob Kroll, president of the Minneapolis Police Officers Federation, the union representing more than 800 officers, did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

Mayor Jacob Frey applauded the chief’s plans in a statement, saying the city needed not only a new police union contract but also “a new compact between the people of Minneapolis and the people trusted to protect and serve.”

Mayor Byron Brown of Buffalo on Wednesday removed a special squad of the city’s Police Department from crowd control duties a week after footage rocketed around the world of the unit’s violent encounter with a 75-year-old protester.

The squad, the Emergency Response Team, will be immediately replaced by a Public Protection Unit that the mayor said would “work with and ensure the safety of any group that wants to peacefully protest.” All 57 members of the Emergency Response Team had resigned after two of their colleagues were suspended for shoving the protester, who was hospitalized.

The announcement was part of a series of measures announced by Mr. Brown on Wednesday: The public will be given easier access to footage of police body camera footage; non-violent low-level offenses will no longer be subject to arrest; and fees and fines will be lowered so as not to be “an undue burden on struggling members of our community,” the mayor said.

Police officers will also undergo training for implicit bias.

“We will shift policing in Buffalo away from enforcement and to a restorative model that promotes stronger community bonds, civic engagement and an end to young black men, black people, being caught in a cycle of crime and incarceration,” the mayor said.

“There must no longer be fear in the black community that an encounter with police will involve discriminatory behavior, and even worse, a fatality.”

Amazon said on Wednesday that it was putting a one-year pause on letting police departments use its facial recognition tool, Rekognition. The artificial intelligence software has been criticized for misidentifying African-Americans and other people of color.

In a two-paragraph blog post, the company said it hoped the moratorium “might give Congress enough time to put in place appropriate rules” for the ethical use of facial recognition. In the past, Amazon had said its tools were accurate but were improperly used by researchers.

Earlier this week, IBM said it would stop selling facial recognition products, and last year the leading maker of police body cameras banned the use of facial recognition on its products at the recommendation of its independent ethics board.

President Trump rejected the idea on Wednesday of changing the names of American military bases that bear the names of Confederate officers, propelling himself even further into the culture war dividing the United States.

“These Monumental and very Powerful Bases have become part of a Great American Heritage, and a history of Winning, Victory, and Freedom,” Mr. Trump wrote in a string of messages on Twitter.

Mr. Trump volunteered his view without being asked, after Gen. David H. Petraeus, the retired Army commander in Iraq and Afghanistan and former director of the C.I.A., wrote in The Atlantic that the 10 United States Army installations named for Confederates should be renamed. The list includes Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Fort Hood in Texas and Fort Benning in Georgia.

On Monday, a Pentagon official said that Defense Secretary Mark P. Esper and Secretary of the Army Ryan D. McCarthy were “open to a bipartisan discussion on the topic” of removing Confederate names from bases.

Mr. Trump, a native of New York, has aligned himself repeatedly with defenders of Confederate heritage, most notably during the Charlottesville, Va., rally in 2017 that attracted white supremacists and turned violent.

A number of Confederate memorials have recently been targeted for removal, including a statue commemorating Confederate soldiers in Alexandria, Va., just outside Washington, and a prominent statue of Robert E. Lee on Monument Avenue in Richmond, Va., that has been covered in graffiti by protesters.

Also on Wednesday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for the removal of 11 remaining Confederate statues on display in the Capitol, including statues of Lee and Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy. “These statues pay homage to hate, not heritage,” she tweeted.

NASCAR said on Wednesday that it would ban the Confederate battle flag from its events and properties, becoming the latest organization to reconsider the flag’s place at a time of national reckoning over racism and white supremacy following the death of George Floyd.

“The presence of the Confederate flag at NASCAR events runs contrary to our commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all fans, our competitors and our industry,” the group said in a statement. “Bringing people together around a love for racing and the community that it creates is what makes our fans and sport special. The display of the Confederate flag will be prohibited from all NASCAR events and properties.”

The racing association made the announcement two days after Darrell Wallace Jr., the first black driver in 50 years to win one of its top three national touring series, called on NASCAR to ban the flags outright.

“No one should feel uncomfortable when they come to a NASCAR race,” Mr. Wallace, who is known as Bubba, told Don Lemon of CNN. “So it starts with Confederate flags. Get them out of here. They have no place for them.”

The association began asking fans to stop bringing Confederate battle flags to races in 2015, after photos circulated online of the white man who killed nine black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., posing with the flag.

NASCAR announced on Tuesday that Mr. Wallace would compete in a car painted with Black Lives Matter imagery at Martinsville Speedway in Virginia on Wednesday. 

American public opinion can sometimes seem stubborn. Voters haven’t really changed their views on abortion in 50 years. Donald J. Trump’s approval rating among registered voters has fallen within a five-point range for just about every day of his presidency.

But the Black Lives Matter movement is proving to be an exception.

Public opinion on race and criminal justice issues has been steadily moving left since the first protests ignited over the fatal shootings of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown. And since the death of George Floyd in police custody on May 25, public opinion on race, criminal justice and the Black Lives Matter movement has shifted leftward.

Over the last two weeks, support for Black Lives Matter increased by nearly as much as it had over the previous two years, according to data from Civiqs, an online survey research firm. By a 28-point margin, Civiqs finds that a majority of Americans support the movement, up from a 17-point margin before the most recent wave of protests began.

Weekly polling for the Democracy Fund’s U.C.L.A./Nationscape survey shows a significant increase in unfavorable views of the police, and an increase in the belief that African-Americans face a lot of discrimination.

Examining the large and rapid shift in American voters’ attitudes on the Black Lives Matter movement.

Seven officers from the Los Angeles Police Department have been reassigned as part of an investigation into excessive force and other misconduct during protests and unrest in Los Angeles spurred by the killing of George Floyd, the department said on Wednesday.

Forty investigators have been assigned to look into 56 cases of possible misconduct, including 28 involving accusations of improper use of force, the department said.

In a statement, the department said it would “look into every complaint thoroughly and hold every officer accountable for their actions.”

Several lawmakers and officials have urged investigations, buttressed by videos showing an officer repeatedly shocking a woman on the ground with a stun gun, a police vehicle pushing into a crowd and officers swinging at protesters with batons.

The president of the Los Angeles Police Commission, Eileen Decker, a former federal prosecutor during the Obama administration, has called for a review of the use of force by officers.

Ms. Decker and the city’s police chief, Michel Moore, announced on Sunday an immediate moratorium on carotid restraint holds by police, which restrict blood flow to the brain by compressing the neck.

Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles said last week that he would look into cutting as much as $150 million from the Police Department’s budget.

A freelance photographer and author who was blinded in one eye by a law enforcement officer during a night of unrest in Minneapolis filed a federal lawsuit on Wednesday, accusing the city and state police of deliberately targeting the news media.

Linda Tirado, 37, was struck in the left eye by a non-lethal projectile fired by an officer on May 29, as she was covering demonstrations after the death of George Floyd. Ms. Tirado said officers ignored the press credential she wore around her neck and first hit her with a green tracking round, leaving a mark on her backpack.

“Then, with a bright green target on her, the police shot her in her face,” her lawyers wrote.

U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, a joint effort of several journalism organizations, has collected well over 200 reports from around the country of journalists being arrested, shot with non-lethal rounds, hit or pepper-sprayed by law enforcement officers while covering the protests of the past two weeks. It says it is looking into more than 90 incidents in Minnesota alone.

The Minneapolis Police Department uses 40 mm “less-lethal” foam rounds, and Ms. Tirado said doctors had removed foam particles from her eye.

Ms. Tirado, a mother of two who lives in Tennessee and does not have health insurance, has had two operations. She said she had lost her sense of depth perception and did not expect to be able to work as a photographer.

“I’m not sure I am ever going to feel comfortable in a protest situation where I might have to run,” she said in an interview.

Asked if she was deliberately targeted, she said: “I think the totality of evidence is that there certainly was animus toward the press.”

A lawyer for Ms. Tirado, Tai-Heng Cheng, said that if she won a settlement or judgment, after paying her medical bills she would donate the money to a charity dedicated to police reform.

A Minneapolis Police spokesman said his agency did not fire at Ms. Tirado.

“Our department was not a part of that incident,” John A. Elder, a spokesman, said. “Several agencies have been involved in addressing the riots.”

Five days later, after Ms. Tirado’s photos of the police surfaced, Mr. Elder revised his statement, acknowledging that if Ms. Tirado was hit by foam bullets — as opposed to rubber bullets — the Minneapolis Police could have been responsible.

Bruce Gordon, a spokesman for the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, said “we are reviewing the incidents involving our troopers,” but would not say whether a state officer had fired at Ms. Tirado.

He added that it “can be difficult for officers to distinguish journalists from those who are violating a curfew order or not complying with commands to leave an area.”

A video showing sheriff’s deputies delivering repeated electric shocks to a black man just before he died, even as he told them he had heart disease and could not breathe, has triggered calls for the sheriff of a Central Texas county to resign, amid nationwide protests against bias and excessive force in policing.

The incident occurred last year, but the video, with parallels to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis that has ignited two weeks of demonstrations, was made public on Monday, a day before Mr. Floyd was laid to rest after an emotional service in Houston. The video was published by The Austin American-Statesman and an Austin TV station, KVUE.

The death of the man, Javier Ambler, after a car chase drew little attention at the time, but after the release of the video, taken from a police officer’s body camera, three of four Williamson County Commissioners have demanded the resignation of Sheriff Robert Chody. The Sheriff’s Department concluded that the deputies did nothing wrong.

The case is also under investigation in Travis County, where the car chase ended, and is expected to be presented to a grand jury.

“Yet another black man aggressively arrested and resulting in death,” one of the Williamson County commissioners, Terry Cook, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.

The deputies tried to pull over Mr. Ambler over for failing to dim his headlights, but he led them on a 22-minute chase. The events were filmed by crew members from A&E’s reality show “Live PD” who were riding with the deputies, Austin outlets reported.

After Mr. Ambler, 40, finally stopped, deputies attempted to put him facedown on the ground and cuff his hands behind his back. In the video, he appears to resist, telling them that he has congestive heart failure and — like Mr. Floyd — that he cannot breathe. At one point Mr. Ambler said “save me.”

After the deputies restrained him, Mr. Ambler became unresponsive and they tried unsuccessfully to revive him. An autopsy concluded that he died of heart disease in combination with the deputies restraining him.

Representatives of “Live PD” told The American-Statesman on Tuesday that no law enforcement agency had asked for its footage of the death, which was never broadcast. They said that after the Sheriff’s Department concluded its internal investigation, it had destroyed that video as a matter of routine.

Will a New Progressive Star Emerge on Tuesday?,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host.

Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.

With some notable exceptions (ahem, A.O.C.), progressive challengers haven’t had the best track record of winning Democratic primaries.

That may change this week.

Primary elections in New York and Kentucky tomorrow will provide a big test of how Democratic politics are shifting amid a pandemic, an economic crisis and an uproar over racial injustice.

In 2018, progressives nabbed some high-profile victories — including those by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and her “squad” — but lost far more than they won. 

The path for progressives hasn’t gotten any easier in 2020. Three liberal House candidates who captured a lot of attention — Jessica Cisneros in Texas, Robert Emmons in Illinois and Morgan Harper in Ohio — lost their primary contests.

Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, a squad member, faces a stiff primary rematch against Brenda Jones, the Detroit City Council president, who lost by fewer than 1,000 votes in 2018. In Massachusetts, Senator Ed Markey, who is backed by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and other progressive groups, is being outpolled by his primary challenger, Representative Joe Kennedy III.

And, of course, Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren lost their primary bids to Joe Biden.

But that was in the Before Times. Now, with crises roiling the country, progressive candidates are seeing their message of structural change amplified.

“The pandemic and the protests have increased the desire for aggressive and bolder politics,” said Faiz Shakir, who was Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager. “You have some compelling candidates in the right places who are seizing the moment and meeting the need.”

Stumbles on racial issues have already hurt some establishment candidates. Former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, who is running for the Senate, apologized this month for answering a question about the Black Lives Matter protests by saying the phrase meant “every life matters” — a common conservative response. He now faces a tighter-than-expected primary on June 30 against Andrew Romanoff, the former state House speaker.

And Representative Eliot Engel of New York, a Democrat who has served in Congress for more than three decades, was caught on a recording this month asking to speak at a news conference in the Bronx devoted to Black Lives Matter: “If I didn’t have a primary,” he said, “I wouldn’t care.”

Mr. Engel, 73, faces a serious challenge in tomorrow’s primary from Jamaal Bowman, 44, a Bronx school principal recruited by the Justice Democrats — the same progressive organization that coordinated Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s surprise defeat of Joseph Crowley two years ago. Liberals hope the race will be a repeat of that contest. But unlike then, when Mr. Crowley skipped a debate against Ms. Ocasio-Cortez just 10 days before the primary, no one is being caught unaware.

As my colleague Jesse McKinley wrote, money and marquee endorsements have been flying in the final days of the race. And unlike Mr. Crowley, Mr. Engel hasn’t been shy about attacking his challenger.

In Kentucky, Amy McGrath, a retired Marine fighter pilot who earned a national following from her close House race in 2018, faces a tightening challenge from Charles Booker, a 35-year-old state representative and unabashed progressive. Mr. Booker was tear-gassed by the police at a recent protest.

As my colleague Jonathan Martin detailed over the weekend, Ms. McGrath, 45, has the cash, raising nearly $41 million to Mr. Booker’s $788,000 as of June 1. But Mr. Booker is catching up in polling, and his crowds have grown in the lead-up to tomorrow’s vote.

Either candidate will face an uphill battle against Senator Mitch McConnell. But the contest is deeply symbolic for Democrats, many of whom detest Mr. McConnell, the Senate majority leader. Making the senator spend money in his home state would thrill party leaders.

Democrats will be carefully watching both contests tomorrow night for clues on what the future may hold for their party, particularly if they can no longer rally around the unifying force of their hatred for President Trump in the next midterm elections.

They may be watching for a while: With skyrocketing requests for absentee ballots, limited in-person voting and the likelihood of long lines to accommodate social distancing, neither race is expected to return results for several days — if not weeks.

Drop us a line!

Last week, we marked three months since the pandemic and the shutdown orders restructured our lives.

Since then, the president hosted an indoor rally, though a lot of seats were empty. New cases continue to surge in 22 states, especially in the West and the South, even as more places open for business. And I just found out that I’m probably working from home until 2021. …

So, it’s been a day.

How’s it going with you? Are you happy with how the government is responding to the continuing crisis? What about your schools, offices, friends and family?

We want to hear it. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com. (Don’t forget to include your name and where you live so we can publish your responses.)

The internet cannot resist President Trump’s rally speech. Ted Mosby … er, Josh Radnor … turned it into a folk ballad. (It works! Weirdly.)

Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat of California, cut a re-election ad. He drinks water. Fin.

Judge Is Assigned to Officers’ Murder Trial,"This briefing has ended. Follow our live coverage of Black Lives Matters protests here.

The cases of the four police officers charged in the killing of George Floyd will be heard by Judge Peter A. Cahill, a former defense attorney and assistant to Senator Amy Klobuchar, according to court documents filed on Friday.

Judge Cahill was assigned to the case by Assistant Chief Judge Toddrick Barnette, who set the first hearing for June 29.

Judge Cahill previously worked both as a public defender and a prosecutor. He was the chief deputy to Ms. Klobuchar when she ran the Hennepin County attorney’s office and he was appointed as a judge by Tim Pawlenty, the former Republican governor of Minnesota, in 2007.

The cases against the four officers, Derek Chauvin, J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao, who were all fired the day after Mr. Floyd died, are listed on separate dockets but could be combined.

Mr. Chauvin, who pinned his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, has been charged with second-degree manslaughter and second-degree murder, a more serious count than he had originally faced.

The three other former officers are charged with aiding and abetting in Mr. Floyd’s death.

We’re not going to be as a state government subsidizing improper police tactics. We’re not doing it. And this is how we’re going to do it. I’m going to sign an executive order today. We’ll require local governments and police departments all across the state — about 500 — to develop a plan that reinvents and modernizes police strategies and programs in their community. They must formulate a plan. They have to address the use of force by police officers, crowd management, community policing, bias awareness, de-escalation, restorative justice, community-based outreach. They have to have a transparent citizen complaint disposition procedure. So if you make a complaint, it’s not just yelling out the window. You find out what happened to that complaint. They should talk about appropriate equipment, what’s not appropriate equipment and any other issue that that community believes is relevant. Because what we know is certainly true is there is no trust between the community and the police. That’s what the protests have said. There’s no trust. And if there is no trust, the relationship doesn’t work.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York on Friday signed an expansive package of bills aimed at combating police misconduct, endorsing a major overhaul of law enforcement in the wake of George Floyd’s death and the nationwide protests that followed.

The measures, some of which languished for years and faced opposition from police unions, included a ban on the use of chokeholds as well as the repeal of a decades-old statute that has allowed the police to keep disciplinary records of officers secret.

Mr. Cuomo also announced that he would also issue an executive order that would require New York’s roughly 500 local police departments and agencies to develop plans to modernize their tactics with community input, or risk becoming ineligible for state funding.

“We’re not going to fund police agencies in this state that do not look at what has been happening, come to terms with it, and reform themselves,” Mr. Cuomo said. Under the order, the police agencies must adopt their new plans by April 1.

In Minnesota, the state where Mr. Floyd died after an officer pressed his knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes, the State Legislature convened a special session to consider bills aimed at overhauling policing and redressing policies that have led to systemic economic inequality.

The bills include a ban on the use of chokeholds, creating community alternatives to policing and restoring voting rights for paroled prisoners. Some of the bills have been stalled for years, though Democratic lawmakers vowed they would push them through this time.

“Minnesota will change the way we do policing,” Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, said during a news conference on Thursday. “Minnesota will change what accountability looks like, and Minnesota will start to lift up those voices that for too long have felt they haven’t been heard.”

But Minnesota lawmakers emphasized that only they could ensure the reforms are passed into law. “It’s up to us in the Legislature to make transformative change,” said Jeffrey Hayden, a black state senator.

While Democrats control the State House, Republican lawmakers have a majority in the Senate, and it is unclear how many Democratic proposals they might support. On Friday, State Senator Paul Gazelka, the Republican majority leader, said that the video of Mr. Floyd’s arrest had “stirred something in my soul that I would call righteous anger.”

There could now be bipartisan support for measures such as banning chokeholds, but Republicans are more leery of other Democratic proposals, such as restoring voter rights to felons.

None of the reforms being offered go as far as defunding or dismantling police departments altogether — a key demand of some activists that is now being pursued by the Minneapolis City Council. But the package would encourage alternatives to current policing by giving money to groups that step into conflicts without calling law enforcement, or to pair up more social workers with officers on calls.

Also this week, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico said the State Legislature could require body cameras for all law enforcement agencies during an upcoming special session originally scheduled for budget matters. Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio announced that he had directed a state task force to draw up new standards for how the police respond to mass protests. And Massachusetts lawmakers said they were working on legislation to ban chokeholds, enhance police oversight and obligate officers to intervene if a fellow officer is using inappropriate force.

After weeks of calls by protesters to defund police departments, cities and local lawmakers across the country are taking up the cause.

Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh on Friday issued an executive order declaring racism to be a public health crisis, and said the city would transfer $3 million from the Police Department’s overtime budget to public health programs.

In New York City on Friday the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, said the Council had identified $1 billion in cuts to the Police Department’s $6 billion budget, and would urge Mayor Bill de Blasio to agree in advance of the July 1 budget deadline.

Mayor Bill de Blasio rejected the proposal, while indicating that he was open to further negotiations over the size of the Police Department.

“The mayor has said we’re committed to reprioritizing funding and looking for savings, but he does not believe a $1 billion cut is the way to maintain safety,” said Freddi Goldstein, Mr. de Blasio’s press secretary.

“The new normal is not going to be what we experienced in the past. It’s incumbent upon me, it’s incumbent upon all of us, to continue to move forward. Too often we’ve seen a shooting of a black man and we have protests and we turn the page. Sometimes when we turn the page it’s because we can’t get the proper federal attention, or attention to it. It’s incumbent upon me as mayor and the rest of us not to let that happen. The question is, What do I say to the police that we’re moving this money from the overtime budget and it’s not fair to them? The answer is the money that we’re going to be investing is actually benefiting them to deal with racism, to deal with health inequities, to deal with opportunities for our youth, to deal with homelessness. These two steps are the first two steps I’m taking today in declaring racism a public health crisis and also working to do reforms in the Police Department. There are other steps that we have to take in housing, in education, in economic development — all of those — it’s all of it together.”

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti last week proposed cutting $100 million to $150 million from his city’s police department and on Thursday Mayor London Breed of San Francisco said she supported cuts from law enforcement budgets in favor of “programs and organizations that serve communities that have been systematically harmed by past city policies.”

In Texas this week, officials in Dallas and Austin said they were considering decreasing or reallocating police budgets. But Houston voted to increase its police budget, the Texas Tribune reported.

“Some think defunding the police is the answer,” Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo told lawmakers in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday.

“I’m here to tell you on behalf of our mayor and other mayors across the country and police chiefs across the country and the diverse communities that we serve, this is simply not the answer.”

Minneapolis City Council members moved toward replacing the Police Department on Friday, showing that they are serious about reducing the role of traditional police officers, but also signaling that a long, complicated process awaits to determine what will replace them.

Council members took the first step toward putting an initiative on the ballot in November that would ask voters to eliminate the minimum number of police officers required by the city’s charter, which would give Council members much more flexibility to make changes to public safety.

The ballot initiative would also include removing the Minneapolis Police Department from the charter — although not necessarily abolishing it altogether — and adding a new department “focused on cultivating public safety.”

The City Council also voted unanimously, at its virtual meeting, on a resolution to commit to a yearlong effort to research other models of public safety and listen to what residents say they would like to see. Andrea Jenkins, the vice president of the City Council, said the world was looking to Minneapolis to see how it would respond following the killing of George Floyd last month.

“People have marched all over the world, all over the City of Minneapolis, and what they’re saying to us is they want change,” Ms. Jenkins said. “Not ‘fix it,’ not reform, but change. So we must take these voices seriously.”

The resolution passed on Friday creates a “Future of Community Safety Work Group” that will soon begin listening to residents, interviewing experts and studying other models of public safety to determine how various city services could replace many of the Police Department’s current functions.

Alondra Cano, the chairwoman of the public safety committee, said in an interview after the vote that the engagement of city residents would be vital to determining the right solutions for public safety in Minneapolis.

“The future of this city will be decided by the people who live here,” she said.

Ms. Cano said the initiative to get rid of the City Charter’s requirement that the Police Department have .0017 employees per city resident would remove a large hurdle that stands in the way of replacing the department’s functions. If the initiative does get on the ballot in November, it would require a majority of voters to pass.

As crowds have surged through American cities to protest the killing of George Floyd, one of the striking differences from years past has been the sheer number of white demonstrators.

And now, an early estimate of the demographics of the protests has found the crowds were overwhelmingly young and educated with large numbers of white people.

The researchers, Dana Fisher, a sociologist at the University of Maryland, and Michael Heaney, a political scientist at University of Michigan, used an established method for studying street protests. They said their numbers provided only rough estimates, but offer the first, more systematic look at who the protesters are.

White protesters made up 61 percent of those surveyed in New York over the weekend, according to the researchers, and 65 percent of protesters in Washington. On Sunday in Los Angeles, 53 percent of protesters were white.

More than three quarters of those surveyed were under the age of 34, and 82 percent of white protesters had a college degree, while 67 percent of black protesters had one.

President Trump also appeared to be a powerful driver. Forty-five percent of whites surveyed in Dr. Fisher’s work selected Mr. Trump as a motivation for joining the protests, compared with 32 percent of blacks. Whites were most likely to report having attended the 2017 Women’s March, but the second-least likely, after Asians, to report having attended the March for Racial Justice in 2017.

A number of factors have helped shape the demographics of the recent protests. The nine-minute video of a white police officer refusing to remove his knee from Mr. Floyd’s neck has horrified Americans as attitudes on race were already changing, particularly among white liberals. Another motivation is the opposition to Mr. Trump, who has drawn large crowds of protesters beginning the day after his election. Finally, there is the coronavirus pandemic, which has left millions of Americans — including college students — cooped up at home, craving human contact.

President Trump was asked about his position on police chokeholds during a Fox News interview on Thursday with the anchor Harris Faulkner. Here is what he said:

HARRIS FAULKNER: So what do you want to see? What is police reform to you?

PRESIDENT TRUMP: I want to see really compassionate but strong law enforcement, police force. But law enforcement.

FAULKNER: Say no to chokeholds?

TRUMP: Yeah. I don’t like chokeholds. I will say this, as somebody that, you know, you grow up and you wrestle and you fight and you were you see what happens sometimes if you’re alone and you’re fighting somebody who’s tough and you get somebody in a chokehold. What are you going to do, say, oh, and it’s a real bad person and you know that. And they do exist. I mean, we have some real bad people. You saw that during the last couple of weeks. You saw some very good people protesting. You saw some bad people also. And you get somebody in a chokehold. And what you going to do now? Let go and say, oh, let’s start all over again. I’m not allowed to have you in a chokehold. It’s a tough situation. Now, if you have two people in case we’re talking about — four people and two of them, I guess, just pretty much started. So it’s a very, very, very tricky situation. So the chokehold thing is good because to talk about, because off the cuff, it would sound like absolutely. But if you’re thinking about it, then you realize maybe there is a bad fight and the officer gets somebody in a position that’s a very tough position.

FAULKNER: So you’re saying it’s a sliding scale depending on what the circumstances are?

TRUMP: I think you have to probably say —

FAULKNER: Do you want to be in that conversation? Are you in that conversation?

TRUMP: I really am. And I think the concept of chokehold sounds so innocent, so perfect. And then you realize if it’s a one-on-one. Now if it’s two-on-one, that’s a little bit of a different story, depending on the toughness and strength. You know, we’re talking about toughness and strength. We are talking there’s a physical thing here also. But if a police officer is in a bad scuffle and he’s got somebody …

FAULKNER: Well, if it’s a one-on-one fight for the life. That’s what you’re saying.

TRUMP: And that does happen. And that does happen. So you have to be careful, with that being said, it would be, I think, a very good thing that, generally speaking, it should be ended.

FAULKNER: Do you want that to be a top down federal or should it be at the local level?

TRUMP: Well, it could be at the local level.

Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle visited with protesters in the city’s “autonomous zone” on Friday, even as President Trump repeated his demands that she take action to end the takeover of city streets.

Ms. Durkan said in an interview that she had no safety concerns for herself or the public during her visit to the so-called Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, where protesters have gathered across several barricaded blocks. She said she found people with a range of different views but with the overall goal of creating a better community.

“I grew up in Seattle, and Capitol Hill has always been a center for eclectic and robust expression,” Ms. Durkan said.

Police Chief Carmen Best, who has also visited the zone, has expressed concern about the decision to pull officers out of the police station there and said police response times to crimes in the overall region have increased. Ms. Durkan said she did not know of any reports of serious crimes in the zone, where demonstrators have established a co-op for food, a place for medics and a designated smoking area.

Last week, before the zone was established, the streets there had been an epicenter of clashes between police and protesters until officers shuttered their police station and left the area. Ms. Durkan said she didn’t know how long the protesters would remain.

“We broke that cycle,” Ms. Durkan said. “We don’t want to reintroduce that kind of conflict or escalate it unnecessarily.”

President Trump has repeatedly blasted the handling of the protesters, referring to them as terrorists who “burn and pillage our cities.” He said in Twitter message Friday that Ms. Durkan “Must end this Seattle takeover now!”

Ms. Durkan said the president should not be so fearful of democracy.

“He has a pattern of creating his own truth and sticking with it,” Ms. Durkan said. “But his truth does not mirror what the reality is.”

Meanwhile, a federal judge on Friday issued an order preventing the Seattle police from using tear gas, pepper spray, flash-bang grenades or other projectiles against peaceful protesters. The order allows those methods to respond to specific threats or property damage, with tear gas as a last resort.

The Police Department in Tulsa, Okla., said it was investigating one of its officers over remarks he made in a radio interview this week in which he spoke about police shootings of black Americans, amid nationwide protests against racism and ahead of President Trump’s visit next week.

The officer, Maj. Travis Yates, said in the interview that police officers were “shooting African-Americans about 24 percent less than we probably ought to be, based on the crimes being committed.”

In a telephone interview, Major Yates emphasized that he was “talking about the data” from others’ research. In a statement, he said, “To think that, beyond a discussion of comparative statistics, that I would suggest that the ‘police should actually be shooting’ anyone is simply outrageous.”

But his remarks were denounced by the mayor and the president of a black officers’ coalition. And the controversy brought the department under renewed scrutiny, as protests around the country have drawn attention to racial disparities in arrests and the use of force, and have called for greater police accountability. This week, the Tulsa police also announced an inquiry into the arrest of a black teenager who was accused of jaywalking and is shown in body camera footage being forced to the ground by officers.

In a statement on Wednesday, Mayor G.T. Bynum said, “I want to believe he didn’t intend to say what he did, but what he did say goes against everything we are trying to achieve in community policing.”

“If he didn’t mean to make the statement in the way it has been received,” he added, “he owes Tulsans a clarification and an apology.”

Starbucks said on Friday that employees would be allowed to wear Black Lives Matter shirts and pins, a sudden reversal of a company policy that had banned the slogan because it could “amplify divisiveness.”

Amid a social media backlash to the policy, the coffee chain also declared that it would provide 250,000 Starbucks-branded Black Lives Matter shirts for baristas and other employees who want them.

“Starbucks stands in solidarity with our Black partners, community and customers, and understands the desire to express themselves,” Starbucks said in a statement. “We continue to listen to our partners (employees) about how they want to take a stand for justice, while proudly wearing the green apron and standing united together.”

Calls to boycott Starbucks emerged after Starbucks posted a series of messages on social media that many employees considered to be hypocritical. On June 4, the company’s official Twitter account posted: “Black lives matter. We are committed to being a part of change.”

But employees who wanted to project a similar message by wearing shirts or pins on the job had learned in recent days that doing so was prohibited.

As BuzzFeed News reported on Wednesday, an internal Starbucks dress code memo stated that wearing Black Lives Matter clothing and accessories could be misunderstood and incite violence. The guidance was issued in response to inquiries from store managers about whether it was acceptable for employees to wear Black Lives Matter buttons, pins or shirts on the job, according to BuzzFeed.

The memo stated they should not be worn, as they violated the policy prohibiting personal or political clothing or accessories. Instead, Starbucks leadership urged employees to wear a “Black Partner Network’s Keep it Brewing shirt.”

Bill de Blasio took helm of New York City as a white mayor who tied his fortunes to black constituents, with promises to overhaul the Police Department and reduce racial inequality.

But after a series of missteps amid the coronavirus pandemic and protests against police brutality, many of Mr. de Blasio’s black advisers and supporters have abandoned him — a blow that threatens to taint his legacy and erode his last and most faithful constituency.

Much of the anger stems from Mr. de Blasio’s handling of the mass protests that have unfolded across the city following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

When asked about a video of two police cruisers being deliberately driven into protesters, the mayor defended the officers involved. Other images of the police in violent clashes with protesters flooded social media, but Mr. de Blasio would typically say that he had not seen them. When images of looting circulated on the news, the mayor imposed a curfew that was aggressively enforced by the police, who arrested hundreds of protesters. Mr. de Blasio further alienated many demonstrators by praising the police for exercising restraint.

Former advisers publicly questioned the mayor’s commitment to overhauling the Police Department. Hundreds of current and former mayoral staff members demonstrated against him.

And even when Mr. de Blasio called for the officer involved in Mr. Floyd’s death in Minneapolis to be immediately charged, it only underscored how the mayor had steadfastly refused to fire the officer whose chokehold led to the death of Eric Garner, a Staten Island man, in 2014.

While Mr. de Blasio has had his share of accomplishments aimed at reducing income inequality, black leaders have questioned his commitment to overhauling criminal justice.

Under Mr. de Blasio, the Police Department fought in court to expand the interpretation of a 1970s-era law in the state’s civil code known as 50-a, so that it could shield the results of disciplinary hearings against individual officers. The State Legislature voted to repeal the law this week.

The mayor also questioned a bill that would criminalize the police use of chokeholds and was opposed to closing Rikers Island, stances that he eventually changed once it became obvious they would become state law.

After strongly resisting the idea of cutting the Police Department’s budget, the mayor suddenly announced that he would shift money from the police to youth and social services. The reversal in his stance came amid renewed efforts to salvage his relationship with black supporters.

Yet some black leaders say the changes the mayor has proposed so far don’t go far enough.

Seeking to right the wrongful conviction of an African-American man who was falsely accused of rape a century ago, the Minnesota Board of Pardons voted on Friday to unanimously issue a posthumous pardon, a first in the state.

“Mr. Max Mason’s pardon is granted,” said the three-member board, which is made up of Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison and Chief Justice Lorie Gildea. The governor struck the gavel during the board’s virtual meeting, which was streamed live.

Mr. Mason was an African-American who was employed by a traveling circus. Mr. Ellison noted on Friday that he “was wrongly convicted on a groundless charge of rape in the aftermath of the public lynchings of three of his African-American colleagues in Duluth” in 1920.

Mr. Mason’s was the first of many cases up for review during a daylong meeting that included more run-of-the-mill pardon requests, including a woman with a drunken-driving offense, who was also granted a pardon.

The vote in favor of the pardon came quickly after statements from Jerry Blackwell, the lawyer representing the applicant for Mr. Mason’s pardon, and Chief Mike Tusken of the Duluth Police, whose great-aunt alleged that six black members of a traveling circus troop had raped her.

Mr. Mason was one of several black men accused of rape by the woman, Irene Tusken. Initially, six men were arrested in the case and three of them — Isaac McGhie, Elmer Jackson and Elias Clayton — were lynched by a mob that pulled them out of jail where they were being held on June 15, 1920, according to state historical records.

Mr. Mason was arrested later and sentenced to 30 years of hard labor. He was released in 1925 under the provision that he not return to Minnesota for 16 years. He died in his 40s, Mr. Blackwell said.

“Thousands watched racist terrorism,” he said. “We’re talking about a history that does not go away until it is set right.”

He recounted racist comments of the police that are part of the record in Mr. Mason’s case. He described how a police officer also threatened Mr. Mason at gunpoint when he was arrested in Virginia, Minn. “If you don’t talk, I’ll kill you,” Mr. Blackwell said, reciting an officer’s words from the record.

Chief Tusken said the episode of history was his family’s and the State of Minnesota’s great shame. He said that although he had met his great-aunt, he did not learn of her story until after she died.

The board said Mr. Mason’s pardon review had been on the books for months before the killing of George Floyd and years in the making, but they stressed that the pardon would be a balm on the raw wounds not only in the long arc of history but for the pain of the last few weeks.

“There is not one inch of this country that doesn’t need to address this issue,” Mr. Ellison said at the hearing.

The killing of George Floyd has resonated in Europe, drawing thousands of demonstrators into the streets of cities like Paris, London and Berlin. The message has been one of solidarity with protesters in the United States — but also a call to look at racism at home.

The protesters’ cries have brought to the surface a history of discrimination, especially regarding police tactics, which are now being vigorously challenged in several countries. So far, no matter where charges of systemic racism have been leveled, they have been met mostly with firm official denial.

“France, the national police, the gendarmerie, they are not racist,” the French prime minister, Édouard Philippe, insisted in Parliament on Tuesday.

Yet available statistics, and the experience of Europe’s minority populations, often tell a different story. In France, the problems are perhaps most acute. The French police, a largely white force, routinely target African and Arab youths for identity checks and have a long track record of abusive arrests as well as deaths in custody.

“The list is too long,” Assa Traoré told a crowd of demonstrators outside a Paris courthouse last week, reciting the names of those who died in encounters with the police.

The French police, furious at a popular backlash against them, pushed back against government attempts to change their practices and to discipline officers suspected of racism, with demonstrations of their own on Friday.

There were also signs on Friday that the government of President Emmanuel Macron might backtrack, as the interior minister met hurriedly all afternoon with police unions to quell the storm of anger.

The tens of thousands of French who turned out to demonstrate in solidarity with American protesters have also demanded that the government address a long history of policing that they say unfairly targets minorities, resulting in harassment, racial profiling, disproportionate arrests and unjustified deaths during confrontations and in detention.

The international ramifications of the recent protests against law enforcement tactics have reached to nations outside Europe.

Canadians were horrified at a police dash cam video released on Thursday showing an Indigenous chief being tackled to the ground by a police officer, punched in the head and put in a chokehold.

Allan Adam, chief of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation in northern Alberta, was questioned by the police about an expired license plate. He ended up charged with assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest, according to the CBC. The video was presented as an exhibit in his court case.

“It is unacceptable,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday, calling the video “shocking.”

The 1968 Kerner Commission Report Still Echoes Across America,"A young African-American is killed by a white police officer in full view of others. Angry people take to the streets — unrest that goes on night after night, with scores injured and hundreds arrested. Sound familiar?

But this was back in July 1964, in the Harlem and Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhoods of New York. And far worse lay ahead. More racial rioting erupted the following summer in Los Angeles’s Watts section. In 1966 there was yet more, this time in Cleveland. Then came the disastrous summer of 1967. Chaos enveloped more than 160 American cities and towns, the most ruinous riots leading to 43 deaths in Detroit and 26 in Newark.

With the nation reeling that summer, President Lyndon B. Johnson created a task force to explore the roots of the unrest and possible remedies. The National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, led by Gov. Otto Kerner Jr. of Illinois, released a report in February 1968. Known as the Kerner Commission, its findings still echo across the land, wracked once again by turmoil turning largely on uneasy relations between black communities and police departments.

The report offered a conclusion that was deliberately worded to be head-turning: “Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white, separate and unequal.” The report left scant doubt that it regarded white racism as the tinder igniting those 1960s fires.

It was hardly what President Johnson had hoped to hear. He wanted praise for a stewardship of racial matters that included two towering pieces of legislation: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Instead, his own panel painted a bleak picture of race in America. He essentially chose to stash the Kerner report away and ignore it. But many Americans did not. A paperback edition hit the bestseller list.

Today, the United States is more complex in its demography than it was in the ’60s, and is now a rich multicultural and multiethnic mosaic in ways few would have foreseen a half-century ago. Even so, the Kerner panel’s list of troubles endured disproportionately by African-Americans could just as readily be compiled today — a shortage of jobs and adequate education, a persistence of discrimination and harsh police tactics. Police violence against people of color, the commission said, incited the riots more than any other factor. That, too, sounds familiar.

In short, the conclusion then, as now, was that black lives matter.

Kamala Harris Is Done Explaining Racism,"Protesters are demanding to “defund the police.” Mayors are vowing to cut police budgets.

Congressional Democrats are rallying around broad legislation to combat police misconduct. Senate Republicans tapped the only black lawmaker in their ranks to draft a conservative response.

And more than two weeks after the killing of George Floyd in police custody, President Trump plans to address policing at an event in Texas on Thursday.

Public opinion around how the police treat black Americans is shifting — fast.

In the middle of it all is Kamala Harris. The California senator, who’s widely seen as a leading contender to be Joe Biden’s running mate, has taken on a prominent role fighting for a criminal justice overhaul. Ms. Harris is arguing that her experience as a prosecutor — which was a liability for her during the Democratic presidential primary race — gives her firsthand insight into changing a broken system.

We spoke to Ms. Harris about the shifting politics of policing, the importance of smartphone video and, of course, the vice presidency. (As always, our conversation has been edited and condensed.)

Hi. Thanks for chatting today. You are the second black female senator in the country’s history. What does this moment feel like for you, personally?

I mentor a lot of people. I will say to them that you will often find that you are the only one who looks like you in the room, be it around the conference table or in a meeting or wherever you are. But the thing to remember is you are never in that room alone. We are all in that room with you, expecting that you will use your voice, and use it with pride and use it in a way that represents all of those who are in the room with you but not physically there. It is part of the way that I approach my work and always have.

I’ve been in that situation for most of my career, as only the second black woman in the United States who was elected an attorney general of any state. I was the first black woman elected district attorney in the state of California. So it’s not a new experience. Sadly, we are still making so many firsts.

President Obama, Oprah and other prominent black figures in America have talked about being profiled. Have you had that experience of, say, being followed in a department store?

Yes. And my family members have, too. But I just have to tell you, Lisa, I’m really sick of having to explain my experiences with racism to people for them to understand that it exists.

Why do you think people want to hear that kind of personal testimonial?

I don’t know. I don’t know why people keep asking the question. Maybe it’s because they really are still head-in-the-sand and coming to terms with the realities of America on the issue of race.

Do you think we’re having a moment where the politics around this issue is starting to shift?

I’ve been out there with the protesters. I feel very optimistic when I see who is out there. I very much think of this as not a moment but a movement.

And there’s a specific thing that is different about this, and that is the significance of smartphones. I will tell you that probably over the last 10 years, my white friends would come up to me and say, “Kamala, what is going on all of a sudden with all this excessive force?” And I would say to them, “You sound like a colonist.” Because you’re seeing it for the first time, you think you’ve discovered it.

Communities — and in particular the black community — have been shouting and crying, mothers over their dead children’s bodies, been crying in deep pain about these things. But people turned a blind eye or they didn’t believe it or they didn’t want to believe it. But now, because of the smartphone, America and the world are seeing in vivid detail the brutality that communities have known for generations.

You can’t deny. You can’t look away. It’s there. I do believe people are seeing the injustice of it all and are prepared to take action in a way that we’ve not seen before. And that gives me hope.

Of course, in Congress, that involves getting Republican support for legislation.

Right, it does. But look at Mitt Romney — God love him — out there marching, and had the courage and the fortitude and the humanity to speak the phrase: Black Lives Matter.

Are there any other Senate Republicans who you believe could work with you?

There are a number. Honestly, Lisa, the concern I have is just that, once again, the politics of fear. You see Donald Trump starting that up. It’s a playbook that has worked over and over again, which is to present false choices, suggesting that if we have real change, if we shake up the system in a way that is about reimagining it and re-establishing norms based on what should be, chaos will occur. And I hope that my colleagues are immune and see it for what it is.

The anti-lynching legislation that you first introduced in 2018 was blocked by Rand Paul last week. How should voters view Senator Paul’s opposition to that bill?

We are still, these hundreds of years later, having an argument in the United States Senate about whether lynching should be designated a federal crime. It speaks to the fact that we still have so much work to do, to not only acknowledge the history of our country but also acknowledge that we have yet to fully embrace, much less address, the systemic racism that has existed in America and the fact that black lives, in particular, have been legally, historically and currently been considered as less than human.

So, tell me about the legislation you introduced this week, the Justice in Policing Act of 2020.

In the context of everything we’re discussing, it is but one piece of it all. It is very specific and it is about police accountability. It is about making sure that there’s accountability and consequence when people break the rules and break the law. It lowers the standard of criminal intent for an officer who has violated the constitutional rights of people. It gives the Department of Justice and state A.G.s more power to investigate entire police departments for patterns and practices of discrimination.

Also, it’s about independent investigation. I know as a former prosecutor, no matter how well-intentioned the prosecutor may be when investigating the case of abuse or excessive force by a police officer, if that police officer works for an agency that you work with every day, at the very least there will be an appearance of conflict. Independent investigations would be required.

Can I ask you about this idea of defunding the police? What’s your thinking on that idea?

Well, it’s a concept. We do have to reimagine what public safety looks like. And here’s the thing. It is status quo thinking to believe that putting more police on the streets creates more safety. That’s wrong. It’s just wrong. You know what creates more safety? Funding public schools, affordable housing, increased homeownership, job skill development, jobs, access to capital for those who want to start small businesses, or who are running small businesses in communities. 

But, no, we’re not going to get rid of the police. We all have to be practical. But let’s separate out these discussions.

Many cities in our country spend one-third of their entire budget on policing. With all the responsibilities those cities have, one-third on policing? Put it in the context of the fact that over the last many decades, we have essentially been defunding public schools. If anyone thinks that the way we’re going to cure these problems is by putting more police on the street, they’re wrong.

As you mentioned, you were San Francisco’s district attorney and the attorney general of California, roles that became a bit of a liability in your primary campaign. Do you regret starting your political career that way?

Let me tell you, the reason I made a very conscious decision to become a prosecutor was because I am the child of people who, like those today, were marching and shouting on the streets for justice. I am a child of community that was often on the not-great end of law enforcement, in terms of profiling and abuse. And the decision I made was, “I’m going to try and go inside the system, where I don’t have to ask permission to change what needs to be changed.”

But one of the differences between then and now is the incredible leadership of Black Lives Matter, and that movement. Which put the pressure from the outside to counteract the obstacles from the inside that were not only reluctant to change but opposed to change.

I don’t regret it because I know we were able to make a change, but it certainly was not enough.

I will get a lot of angry emails if I don’t ask about your vice-presidential prospects. I am curious whether you think the calculation has changed. Does America need to see a black woman in the White House with Joe Biden, given what’s going on in the country?

I’m going to tell you what I honestly and deeply believe. Joe Biden has got to win this election. And I want him to choose whoever he believes, and whoever can help him win. Period. I know that sounds pretty coldblooded, but that’s where I am.

He’ll make the best decision for him to win in November. And that’s the bottom line.

Iowa Governor Will Restore Voting Rights to Paroled Felons,"Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa said Tuesday that she would issue an executive order to restore voting rights to paroled felons, ending Iowa’s distinction as the last state in the country to strip all former felons of voting rights for life.

As protests over police violence erupted across Iowa in recent weeks, as they have around the country, activists pressured the governor on the issue at the State Capitol. Supporters of Des Moines Black Lives Matter chanted “let them vote” outside the Capitol on Monday, and along with other rights groups and state lawmakers, they met privately with the governor twice.

Ms. Reynolds, a Republican, indicated on Tuesday that she would sign the executive order before the November presidential election, automatically restoring the voting rights of felons who have completed their sentences.

“We’re working on that right now, sitting down with various groups, listening to what they think is important, what is contained in that executive order,” Ms. Reynolds told reporters, according to Radio Iowa, “and then I’ve got my legal team working on it.”

As of 2016, 2.2 percent of voting-age adults in Iowa were unable to vote because of felony convictions, including 9.8 percent of African-Americans in the state, according to The Sentencing Project, which promotes criminal justice reform. The only way a former felon in Iowa can currently regain the right to vote is to individually petition the governor.

The details of Ms. Reynolds’s executive order remain unclear. This month, she signed a Republican-backed bill that excludes former felons who committed certain crimes, including homicide and sex offenses, from automatically regaining voting rights, and that requires released felons to pay restitution before they can vote. Democrats opposed the law, calling restitution a latter-day poll tax.

As restoration of voting rights to former felons has become a fast-moving aspect of criminal justice reform in many states, Iowa has remained an outlier. Ms. Reynolds’s predecessor, Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican, revoked in 2011 an earlier Democratic governor’s executive order automatically restoring felons’ voting rights. After succeeding Mr. Branstad, Ms. Reynolds proposed in 2019 that a constitutional amendment be put to voters on the matter. The Republican-led Legislature, which must first pass a constitutional amendment, has declined to move ahead. On Sunday, lawmakers adjourned for the year without taking action.

Since 1997, 23 states have partly or fully restored voting rights to felons, according to The Sentencing Project. Last year, Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, a Democrat, restored the right to vote to more than 140,000 people who had completed sentences for nonviolent felony offenses.

Florida voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment in 2018 to restore voting rights to nonviolent felons, which would have expanded the franchise overnight to hundreds of thousands of people. But Republican lawmakers in the state, seeking to blunt the amendment, passed a law requiring released felons to pay all fines, court costs and victim restitution before being able to vote. A Federal District Court judge struck down the law as amounting to a poll tax. The case, with the potential to shape the outcome in Florida’s perpetually close-fought presidential race, is before an appeals court. On Sunday, the district court judge refused the request of Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, to stay his order while the appeal is heard."
Trump Supporters Must Waive Right to Sue Over Virus to Attend Rally,"As part of President Trump’s push for America to return to life as it was before the coronavirus pandemic, he is resuming indoor campaign rallies this month even while health officials continue to say people should avoid crowded places.

But the president’s optimism has its limits: Attendees cannot sue the campaign or the venue if they contract the virus at his June 19 rally in Tulsa, Okla.

“By clicking register below, you are acknowledging that an inherent risk of exposure to Covid-19 exists in any public place where people are present,” says a statement on Mr. Trump’s campaign website directed to those wishing to attend the event.

“By attending the rally, you and any guests voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to Covid-19 and agree not to hold Donald J. Trump for President, Inc.; BOK Center; ASM Global; or any of their affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors or volunteers liable for any illness or injury.”

The rally will be Mr. Trump’s first since the pandemic forced most of the country into lockdown three months ago, a campaign official said on Wednesday. Polls have shown former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic nominee, establishing a substantial lead over Mr. Trump.

Oklahoma, a state Mr. Trump won four years ago by 36 percentage points, began lifting restrictions on businesses on April 24 and moved into Phase 3 of its reopening on June 1, allowing summer camps to open and workplaces to return with full staffing.

Mr. Trump’s rally in Tulsa, the site of a massacre of black residents in 1921, will be on Juneteenth, a prominent African-American holiday recognizing the end of slavery in the United States. Juneteenth has gained prominence as the nation publicly reckons with racial discrimination after George Floyd’s death in police custody.

Of the four states the president announced this week as sites for rallies, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina are seeing more new cases of the virus than they had in the past and Oklahoma’s infection numbers are steady. Oklahoma had recorded 7,626 cases of the coronavirus and 357 deaths as of Thursday, according to its health department.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still recommends that people avoid mass gatherings and stay out of crowded places. Some health officials have raised concern that the Black Lives Matter protests may help spread the virus, although gathering outdoors is considered safer than doing so inside.

Republicans announced on Thursday that Mr. Trump would deliver his August national convention speech in Jacksonville, Fla., rather than Charlotte, N.C. He had told officials in North Carolina that he would not abide by the state’s social distancing measures.

What’s Different About the Protests in Los Angeles This Time,"Good morning.

(Don’t already get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.)

On Tuesday night in Los Angeles, the sound of police helicopters once again thudded overhead and sirens screamed as the sun set. Residents who didn’t abide by a curfew were arrested.

Thousands took to the streets in outrage over police brutality captured on video. They were met by the National Guard.

[Read about protests across California.]

As my colleague Tim Arango reported, the parallels have been easy to see between the protests that have roiled the nation’s second biggest city again this week and the riots that erupted in 1992 after four police officers were acquitted of assault in the beating of Rodney King.

But there are key differences.

Some have been driven by conscious actions by organizers who remember 1992.

This week, for instance, the most chaotic scenes in L.A. have played out in largely white, wealthy communities like Beverly Hills, as Tim wrote.

“That’s an important distinction, that these current situations are not happening in black communities,” said Patrisse Cullors, a prominent activist and co-founder of Black Lives Matter who organized a protest on Saturday in the Fairfax District.

Others reflect broader shifts.

[Read the full story here.]

Fernando Guerra, a professor and the director of the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University, said that the clearest difference between the unrest today versus 1992 is that today, the response to police brutality has been “truly multicultural.”

Many of the protesters that have poured into L.A.’s streets this week have come from different backgrounds, Dr. Guerra said, which stands in significant contrast with 1992.

“It’s true that African-Americans and Latinos were in the streets, but not together,” he said. “It was siloed.”

Dr. Guerra said that separation was certainly enforced by the police, who he said were “much more willing to be brutal” in order to contain the destruction to poorer, predominantly black neighborhoods.

But public perception has also changed.

Dr. Guerra has helped run a survey of Angelenos about race and policing since 1997, five years after the riots, and continuing every five years.

In each survey, a steadily increasing share of Angelenos has said that different races and ethnic groups were getting along well. (In 1997, 37 percent said races were getting along well and 63 percent said they were getting along badly, compared with 76 percent who said races were getting along well in 2017.)

In 2017, a quarter century after the riots, the survey found that 58 percent of Angelenos believed that similar riots and disturbances were likely to occur in the next five years — a share that increased for the first time since the study’s inception.

In 2012, just 47 percent of respondents said they thought riots were likely in the next five years.

And according to a different survey by the center, trust in the police over the last several years has remained stable and relatively high in L.A.’s overall population, although that trust is, as you would expect, much lower among African-Americans and Latinos.

While Dr. Guerra said that on the surface, all those trends might seem contradictory, he doesn’t see it that way.

“It makes perfect sense,” he said.

Taken together, Dr. Guerra said what they suggest is much broader understanding of how black and brown Angelenos are too often the targets of police violence — understanding that has translated into greater accountability.

“In the past, we responded to police brutality by saying, ‘Oh, it’s them, not us,’” he said. “Now, it’s, ‘This is our police department, not Daryl Gates’s police department,’ and we expect much more.”

And while the response by the police today has been far from perfect, Dr. Guerra echoed the observation that, unlike in 1992, police and elected leaders have said they support protesters’ rights to speak out and have acknowledged their pain.

Going forward, he said, he expects that the breadth of the protests will exert “even greater pressure on decision makers to make substantive changes.”

Amid what has felt like an endless scroll of videos showing the chaos and tension of protests over the weekend, one image in particular struck me as, well, the opposite of all that.

In a tableau that can really only be described as majestic, a black woman rides an enormous brown horse down the urban canyon that is Broadway in Oakland.

A “Black Lives Matter” sign hangs down the horse’s flank.

Unsurprisingly, I was not the only one moved by photos of the woman, Brianna Noble, 25, astride her horse, Dapper Dan.

Ms. Noble told KQED that she took Dapper Dan, a “17-hand,” 1,800-pound horse out to Friday’s march because she wanted to help shift the narrative of the protests — give people, “a good, bright, positive image to focus on, as opposed to some of the destruction.”

She said that she used to be bothered by the fact that she was one of the few black women she knew to be horseback riding. Now the owner of Mulatto Meadows, a horseback riding center in Martinez, Ms. Noble hopes her visibility helps inspire other young Bay Area residents to get involved in the riding community.

And as she told The Guardian: “No one can ignore a black woman sitting on top of a horse.”

Court Allows Trump’s Tulsa Rally to Go Ahead,"This briefing has ended. Read the latest coverage here.

The Oklahoma Supreme Court on Friday afternoon rejected a legal bid to stop President Trump from holding a rally in Tulsa over the weekend, the latest twist in the lead-up to an event that has become a flash point as the country grapples with the coronavirus crisis and intensifying calls for racial justice.

A lawsuit filed by local residents and businesses had demanded that the rally be postponed unless the arena hosting it agreed to enforce social distancing guidelines.

The event, Mr. Trump’s first since the coronavirus pandemic led to widespread national shutdowns, comes as confirmed cases are rising in Tulsa and as the nation celebrates Juneteenth, a holiday marking the end of slavery in the United States.

The holiday has taken on an added significance for many this year as the country grapples with its racist history, a legacy of violence that is painfully significant in Tulsa, the site of a 1921 race massacre in which up to 300 people were killed and hundreds of homes and businesses were destroyed when a white mob attacked the black neighborhood.

A series of tweets by Mr. Trump threatened to escalate tensions on Friday, adding divisive rhetoric to the Juneteenth holiday.

Mr. Trump on Friday morning issued a thinly veiled threat to people who want to protest his campaign rally, scheduled for Saturday evening. “Any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma please understand, you will not be treated like you have been in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. “It will be a much different scene!”

Later, Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, told reporters that the president did not mean to threaten peaceful protesters. “What he was meaning are violent protesters,” she said.

By Friday afternoon, a representative for Mayor G.T. Bynum of Tulsa said the city had rescinded a three-night curfew that it had announced previously, after Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he had spoken with the mayor, “who informed me there will be no curfew tonight or tomorrow for our many supporters.”

Mr. Bynum, a moderate Republican mayor who is friendly with the Trump campaign, has said he was “grateful” Tulsa was chosen as the host city for Mr. Trump’s comeback rally. He previously said the curfew order was put in place because he had received information that showed that “individuals from organized groups who have been involved in destructive and violent behavior” elsewhere were planning to travel to Tulsa “for purposes of causing unrest around the rally.”

In a keynote speech at the Tulsa Juneteenth Celebration on Friday night, the Rev. Al Sharpton, the well-known civil rights leader, responded to the president’s Friday morning tweet. “Do what you want to do,” he said. “We won’t bend, we won’t bow, we won’t give up. We have fought harder battles than this.”

Mr. Sharpton implored Mr. Trump to speak to protesters’ concerns by pushing for policies that go beyond his recent executive order on police reform, which aimed to incentivize departments to improve standards for the use of force.

“Come to Tulsa tomorrow night and announce something concrete,” Mr. Sharpton said. “Or don’t come at all!”

Vice President Mike Pence twice refused to say that “black lives matter” during an interview on a Philadelphia television station on Friday, insisting instead that “all lives matter in a very real sense.”

Mr. Pence also said during the interview with WPVI-TV that Americans have cherished the idea that everyone is created equal “from the founding of this nation,” an assertion that ignores the institution of slavery.

The vice president’s comments came on Juneteenth, a holiday that marks the end of slavery in America, and at a time when the country is convulsing in outrage about police violence against African-Americans following George Floyd’s death last month.

In the interview, Mr. Pence called Mr. Floyd’s killing while in Minneapolis police custody “a tragedy,” but his insistence that “all lives matter” will likely appear as a provocation by activists and others who say that phrase fails to acknowledge the specific threats that African-Americans still face at the hands of police officers.

Brian Taff, the news anchor, pressed Mr. Pence on that point: “People are saying, of course all lives matter, but to say the words is an acknowledgment that black lives also matter at a time in this country when it appears that there’s a segment of our society that doesn’t agree. So why will you not say those words?”

The vice president said he does not accept the fact that “there’s a segment of American society that disagrees, in the preciousness and importance of every human life.” He again refused to say that black lives matter.

Mr. Pence is set to arrive on Saturday in Tulsa, Okla., the site of one of the nation’s worst examples of racial violence, where a white mob laid siege to a prosperous black neighborhood in 1921, killing hundreds of people. Mr. Pence will join President Trump for a campaign rally Saturday evening.

Millions of Americans observed Juneteenth like never before on Friday as the holiday, which is traditionally celebrated by African-Americans to mark the end of slavery in the country, was propelled into the national spotlight at a time when Americans are wrestling with the impact of racism in many sectors of society.

Although the coronavirus moved some festivities online, Juneteenth events were held around the country, from park celebrations in Flint, Mich., to protests in New York City.

After a day of peaceful demonstrations in Atlanta, gunfire erupted Friday evening near a protest at a busy intersection outside of downtown. According to two witnesses and videos of the confrontation, a white man who was angered by demonstrators blocking an intersection, who were mostly African-American, took a rifle out of his trunk and then accelerated toward one of the protesters, clipping him.

Gunfire broke out immediately afterward, although it was unclear from the videos who was firing. Less than an hour after the incident, the intersection was quiet.

The Atlanta Police Department later said in a statement that they had detained a protester suspected of firing at the vehicle, which was damaged by gunfire. The driver was not injured, the police said.

Across the city, near a vigil by the Wendy’s where Rayshard Brooks was shot and killed by a police officer last week, a woman was shot in the leg late Friday night, authorities said. The shooting is under investigation.

transcript

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

Today: It began with a government promise 155 years ago that in some ways has yet to be fulfilled. Professor Daina Ramey Berry on the history of Juneteenth, and what it means in this moment. It’s Friday, June 19.

Dr. Berry, take us back to June 19, 1865, and what happened that day.

For most enslaved people in Texas, it was a typical day. They got up, they went to the fields, were picking cotton or producing sugar, and working just as they always had done. This was two months after the Civil War ended and two-and-a-half years after the Emancipation Proclamation that President Lincoln issued on January 1 of 1863. Although they were fighting for their freedom, although they were still running away and committing acts of day-to-day resistance on plantations, enslaved people were not actually living in freedom.

But on that day, June 19 of 1865, General Gordon Granger of the Union Army galloped into Galveston with 2000 other individuals and came and gave a proclamation. “The people of Texas,” Granger said, “are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the executive of the United States, slaves are free.

This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor.”

Formerly enslaved people, when they heard the news that slavery was over in Texas, celebrated. It was a day of great jubilee.

They danced, they sung, they fled their plantations.

It was them claiming their freedom. It was them going out and embracing it. It was them packing their bags and leaving. It was them hugging their loved ones and saying, we’re free. We’re finally free.

In the 1930s, the Works Progress Administration interviewed formerly enslaved people and asked them to tell their stories of slavery. Many recalled June 19, particularly those that had been enslaved in Texas. We learned decades later of their experience and their response to when they learned about freedom.

Sarah Ford said, “When freedom come, I didn’t know what that was.” Her uncle came to the yard and yelled, “Everybody free, everybody free. And pretty soon soldiers comes and the captain reads the proclamation.”

Others like Molly Farrell, a Texas bond woman, said, “Everybody talk about freedom and hope to get free before they die. Me and my mother left right off. Most everybody else goes with us. We walked down the road, singing and shouting to a beat of the band. My father comes the next day and joins us.”

Sarah Ashley recalled, “I was 19 years old when the burst of freedom come in June and I get turned loose.” Her former enslaver said that they were welcome to stay, except her father felt like they wanted to leave, Sarah recalls. “Papa left, but he came back with a wagon and mules. When he borrows and he loads up mama and my sister and me, and us goes to East Columbia on the Brazos River, and we settled down. They hired out my time, gave us a patch of land, and for the first time, I ever seen money. Papa builds us a cabin and a corn crib, and I was so happy, because the bright light done come and there was no more whippins.”

Within a year when formerly enslaved people are celebrating Juneteenth, they’re also facing grave restrictions upon their lives because of the 1866 Black Codes, which restricted African-Americans from doing everyday activities — restricted them from where they could go. They actually predated Jim Crow legislation. This was also the same year that the Ku Klux Klan was founded in Pulaski, Tennessee.

But African-Americans that were formerly enslaved in Texas celebrated on. They celebrated Juneteenth in their backyards, in their churches, in their communities. They had barbecues and picnics and celebrated and remembered. They remembered the institution of slavery. Elders came and talked to the young children and told them about their experiences with slavery, and wanted them to recognize the importance and the significance of emancipation. Because of the Great Migration, African-Americans that lived in Texas moved to other parts of the United States, and they brought the celebration of Juneteenth, Emancipation Day, with them.

But then, in the 1920s, ‘30s and ‘40s, because of Jim Crow laws, African-Americans celebrated Juneteenth in private settings, in their homes and in their churches. They were restricted in terms of parks and public spaces. They could not go to movie theaters except for on certain days, and they had to enter through certain doors. They were restricted from amusement parks, water fountains, lunch counters. All forms of segregation forced African-Americans into their own communities. And in these spaces, during the heart of Jim Crow segregation, African-Americans celebrated Juneteenth privately.

Uh! Your bad self! Say it louder! I’m black and I’m proud!

The resurgence of the public version of Juneteenth returns in the 1960s with the civil rights movement and the Black Power movement.

[CHANTING] Black is beautiful.

The Black Power movement disseminated ideas about black is beautiful.

[CHANTING] Set our water free. Frey Huey! Set our water —

Black people embraced the way they looked.

The reason for it, you might say, is like a new awareness among black people that their own natural appearance, physical appearance, is beautiful.

Their hair, their clothing.

Isn’t it beautiful? All right.

— an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my poor little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. I have a dream today.

At this time, African-Americans were celebrating victories from the civil rights movement.

Now, in this summer of 1964, the Civil Rights Bill is the law of the land. In the words of the president, it restricts no one’s freedom, so long as he respects the rights of others.

And they then started becoming more and more public about their celebrations with Juneteenth festivals.

Residents of Resurrection City, and my fellow citizens —

One particular celebration occurred on June 19 of 1968.

— I stand here today with many mixed emotions.

The D.C. Urban League invited Coretta Scott King to speak on that day.

For it was five years ago that my late husband, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., stood in this very spot and told the nation about his dream.

A mourning wife, a grieving mother is talking to a crowd of 75,000 people about African-American freedom and the freedom of all people.

Perhaps racism can be traced to that dark period in our history when slavery became institutionalized for 244 years.

The roots of racism, she reminded us, deprived African-Americans and other poor people of color dignity, self-respect, jobs, and they often experienced violence by the hands of white Americans.

The road to justice, peace and brotherhood is difficult. We must renew our strength, increase our faith and gird our courage.

People left this particular celebration and brought it back to their homes in their states throughout the country.

And in this moment, African-Americans are embracing and celebrating Juneteenth. They’re celebrating it because they’re taking pride in their culture, they’re remembering a difficult part of their history — the history of slavery — and they’re recognizing freedom and equality.

Juneteenth becomes a state holiday in Texas officially in 1980. And from this moment on, celebrations from Juneteenth become much more public, large scale parades, barbecues, picnics. African-Americans are celebrating and sharing the stories of slavery, sharing the history of slavery and sharing oral histories from those that remember celebrations from years ago.

Another widely publicized incident captured on videotape has become a focus for ethnic tensions between the black and Korean communities in Los Angeles.

Then there came a moment in the early 1990s where Juneteenth celebrations took on new meanings.

March 16, 1991. Latasha Harlins, a black teenager, is shot and killed by a Korean store owner, Soon Ja Du.

Du claimed Harlins was stealing a bottle of orange juice when she confronted the teenager.

The merchant, Soon Ja Du, was convicted of voluntary manslaughter. Her sentence: five years probation. No jail time.

The black community is outraged.

And it sends a bad message that a human life is not valued.

What, six months probation? I mean, the people were pissed then.

The title of this videotape is very appropriate. It’s called “The Foothill Incident.” And by now, like every man, woman and child in probably the United States, you have witnessed this videotape in your own living rooms over and over again.

A bystander videotaped the policeman shocking 25-year-old Rodney King with a stun gun, then clubbing and kicking him as he lay on the ground.

Against a growing national furor over last weekend’s police beating of an unarmed black motorist, Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates said today that all 14 officers involved will be disciplined, and that three will face criminal charges.

These two incidents sparked unrest in the community. But after the King beating, African-Americans were once again on alert.

35 days of testimony, 54 witnesses, the video played scores of times in real time, slow motion, frame by frame. Finally, the jurors leave to deliberate.

Well, my reaction is shock first and then disappointment. Obviously, we feel the evidence warranted a conviction on the defendants, and the jury disagreed with us. And we must abide by their decision.

All the police officers involved in the beating of Rodney King were acquitted, and that led to the Los Angeles riots.



The violence erupted after the acquittal of four white policemen in the beating trial of black motorist Rodney King.

We’re being told that several patrol cars have been surrounded near Parker Center downtown. All of the officers in the Central Division are being instructed to put on their helmets with shields in the area near the police headquarters.

[CHANTING]

I feel that there is an undercurrent of racism and that the system is rotten to the core.

No justice, no peace!

We’re looking at you. We can tell you now at least five major fires have broken out in South Central.

There were so many blazes the fire department couldn’t respond to all the calls and just let some buildings burn to the ground.

Yes, they saw law abiding citizens expressing their anger at the verdict. And they chose as an opportunity to steal, to loot, to vandalize and indeed, to kill. That we cannot and will not tolerate.



As in 1968, after the Rodney King beating, there was a resurgence in the celebration of Juneteenth, because African-Americans were thinking about freedoms and thinking about civil rights and thinking about Rodney King. They wanted to celebrate and focus on African-American liberty, African-American justice, and they felt like Rodney King did not receive justice. So Juneteenth celebrations were celebrations to recognize freedom and recognize enslavement at the same time.

So the story of Juneteenth, from what you’re saying, is cyclical. It’s the story of cycles of joy and pain living side by side. And the last time that Juneteenth experienced a major resurgence began with this scene of police brutality and systemic racism broadcast to the entire country.

Absolutely. We saw this the very first year Juneteenth was celebrated in the 1860s against the backdrop of both joy and pain, of slavery and freedom. We saw this in the 1960s. We saw this again in the 1990s. And we’re seeing this again today.



We’ll be right back.

So Dr. Berry, here we are. It’s about 30 years after Rodney King. And we are in the middle of another national outcry over police violence and systemic racism. And it is now June 19, 2020 — Juneteenth. And I know that this may be a bit of an unfair question to ask a historian without the benefit of time and of distance, but what does this day mean right now in this moment?

For me, as a historian, it means celebrating African-American freedom and African-American restraints that are put upon us as a people. It is a moment where we celebrate gains and losses.

We’re seeing African-Americans today being beaten the same way we did in the 1990s, the same way we did in the ‘60s, and in the 1860s. We’re seeing African-American life being devaluated by not only police officers, but also citizens who feel like they have the right to challenge and confront African-Americans for doing everyday, mundane tasks. Black people are being killed in their living rooms. They’re being killed in their backyards. They’re being killed on the streets. And they’re being killed sleeping in their cars. They’re being killed for going and purchasing some Skittles or playing with a toy gun in a park.

I have these conversations, and these conversations means so much to me, as a mother who has an African-American teenage young man in my household.

And so what has that conversation been like with your son?

Very difficult conversations with him. The fear of the police and what to do if he’s confronted. We had that conversation with him when he was 12. And it’s been hard because we have very close friends that are police officers. So it’s a very mixed conversation, you know, to have with him. And to talk to him about how to interact, how to carry himself, how to speak, when to speak, what to do with his hands. All of these sort of prescriptive things that we talk to him about, so that he knows what to do, and that he can make smart decisions when being confronted by police officers.

And he worries that his life expectancy is short. And he said that to me when he was eight. And he’s talked about it recently, and he said, you know, am I going to live to 30?

And what did you say back?

What did I say back. I said, that’s a reality that is hard. And as a mother, it’s hard to have this conversation. But yes, you can live till you’re more than 30.

But that the reality is, no matter what he does, some people will still look at him as a threat to society. He remembers when he was “cute.” He was still cute at seven. But once he became eight or nine, people started grabbing their purses on elevators when we got on elevators.

Just two weeks ago in our own neighborhood, when we were walking our dog, he was behind me, and some of our neighbors followed him because he had a mask on. And he said, well mom, how do I protect myself from disease when people are looking at me as a criminal? And I said, carefully, gingerly. And do the best you can at being who you are, being proud of who you are, but also being careful that not everybody see you as the beautiful child that I gave birth to and that my husband and I have raised.



So in this cycle of joy and pain that has always been Juneteenth, which way does it lean for you and for your family this year? Joy or pain?

Pain. Absolutely pain. We’re hurt by the ways in which African-Americans are being hurt in this country. We’re hurt that all of the battles of freedom and for equality. We’re hurt that no matter what we do, we’re still being treated with a level of disrespect that hearkens back to earlier periods in American history.

I teach an African-American history class called Intro to African-American History. And it covers African arrival in what became the United States until today. It’s a big, sweeping time period. But students often are exhausted by the time we reach the 20th century, because of the highs and lows that African-Americans have experienced in this country.

I remember one student asking me, where is the black joy? When do we get to see black joy? And I said we’re coming up to the Harlem Renaissance. There’s lots of joy in that decade. But then it follows by the Great Depression and the Jim Crow legislation and lynching. And so once we have a high, then it ebbs down into a low valley of despair and pain. And students are saying again, Dr. Berry, we’re getting exhausted. We’re going back into this period of despair. And then there’s a resurgence of the civil rights movement and the Black Power movement, and we have another sort of swing upward.

But as a historian, I wonder, in this moment — it’s hard to interpret historical moments when we’re in them — but I wonder what we’ll say about today 50 years from now. Will we say that there was a change, or is this another high or another low that we’ve experienced, and we go back to business as usual? I like to think, because I’m an optimist, that there will be change and that we will come out of this low moment as a better people and a better society.



When you think about Juneteenth as the day that finally brought freedom to enslaved people in Texas, how do you think about freedom in this moment?

For me, when I think about Juneteenth as Emancipation Day, and I think about this moment, I feel like we still need to be emancipated. There are still more freedoms that need to be protected. There’s still more laws that need to be revised. There’s still more inclusion that needs to happen. There’s still more achievement to be had. There’s still more space for change and growth.

And so for me, on today, on Juneteenth, I’m reflecting on how can I, in my little corner of the world, make change happen and make generations that come after me experience a more just and whole society. And I spend the day reflecting on that, and having conversations with my husband and my son, and trying to encourage him to have hope and faith in the future.



Dr. Berry, thank you very much. We appreciate it.

Thank you for having me on this historic day.



We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today. The Times reports that global daily infection rates from the coronavirus reached record highs over the past week, driven by outbreaks in Latin America, Africa, South Asia and the United States. In Brazil, officials reported more than 32,000 new cases on Wednesday, the most in the world. The U.S. reported the second most, more than 25,000. Within the U.S., California and Florida reported their highest daily infections yet on Thursday, prompting California to require the state’s 40 million residents to cover their faces in almost all settings outside the home. And —

I’ve sent a letter to the clerk of the House, directing the clerk to remove the portraits of four previous speakers of the House who served in the Confederacy.

In Washington, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she would take down the portraits of four previous House speakers who had served in the Confederacy. One of them, James Orr of South Carolina, had vowed on the floor of the House to quote, “preserve and perpetuate slavery.”

There’s no room in the hallowed halls of this democracy, this temple of democracy, to memorialize people who embody violent bigotry and grotesque racism of the Confederacy.

Many corporate employees had Friday off, after Twitter, Nike, Target and other major companies added Juneteenth as a paid holiday this year. And Virginia and New York said that Juneteenth would be a paid holiday for state employees.

On Friday, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota called on the State Legislature to establish Juneteenth as a state holiday. And Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said that starting next year, Juneteenth would be an official city and school holiday.

Adding to the momentum, John Cornyn, the senior Republican senator from Texas, where Juneteenth originated, announced on Thursday that he planned to introduce a bill to make the day a federal holiday. Four Democrats in the Senate — Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Tina Smith of Minnesota and Ed Markey of Massachusetts — announced a similar proposal on Thursday.

The developments are the latest example of the impact of national protests over the police killings of George Floyd and other black Americans. The consequences have quickly spread across society, roiling institutions, prompting legal reforms and now formalizing Juneteenth as a holiday recognized by a diverse swath of the country.

“This is unprecedented,” said Albert S. Broussard, a professor of history at the Texas A&M University, who said his own employer was allowing nonessential employees to take Juneteenth as a paid holiday. “This moment in time has motivated people to react differently, to behave differently about this, and that’s a good thing.”

On June 19, 1865, Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, and read the announcement that all enslaved African-Americans were free, sharing the news with the remote Confederate state about two months after the South surrendered in the Civil War and more than two and a half years after Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation.

“Back up, back up!” [cheering] [cheering] [cheering]

In the late hours of Friday evening, statues of Confederate figures were yanked off their pedestals by cheering crowds of protesters in two Southern cities and paraded through the streets.

After several attempts, protesters in Washington toppled and set fire to a statue of Albert Pike, a Confederate general whose monument has been targeted for removal by different groups for decades.

Shortly afterwards, President Trump tweeted that “the D.C. Police are not doing their job as they watch a statue be ripped down & burn. These people should be immediately arrested. A disgrace to our Country!”

Earlier in the evening, in Raleigh, N.C., protesters pulled down the bronze statues of two Confederate soldiers that had been attached to the base of a 75-foot tall monument on the grounds of the State Capitol. Pictures and video from the scene showed people pulling one of the statues off the pedestal, dragging it through the street and then hanging it from a sign pole.

And in San Francisco, videos on social media showed protesters in Golden Gate Park bringing down monuments of Junípero Serra, a Spanish priest who founded some of the first Catholic missions in California, and Francis Scott Key, the writer of the lyrics to the national anthem and a slave owner.

These are just the latest monuments associated with racial oppression to come down across the country, most of them by the orders of authorities but some at the hands of demonstrators.

Protesters have removed or defaced statues of Christopher Columbus from Miami to Boston, toppled statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson — both slaveholders — in Portland, Ore., and pushed authorities to take down Confederate monuments in Alabama.

Vestiges of Confederate memorabilia long thought to be immune to public pressure, such as the Gen. Robert E. Lee statue in Richmond, Va., and the Mississippi state flag, which features the Confederate battle emblem in its corner, are now the subject of intense debate in state legislatures and in courtrooms.

On Thursday, the portraits of four speakers of the U.S. House of Representatives who served the Confederacy were removed from the Capitol by orders of Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Chief Schroeder is today initiating termination procedures against Louisville Metro Police Officer Brett Hankison. Unfortunately due to a provision in state law that I very much would like to see changed, both the chief and I are precluded from talking about what brought us to this moment or even the timing of this decision. I know that you will have questions. And I’m sorry that I cannot answer them because of the state law, K.R.S. Chapter 67C.3261F. Please direct any questions about the state law precluding us from commenting further to Jefferson County Attorney Mike O’Connell.

The police in Louisville, Ky., are moving to terminate one of the officers involved in the death of Breonna Taylor, Mayor Greg Fischer announced on Friday, the first significant action taken against an officer in a case that has drawn widespread criticism and national protests.

As one of three officers who used a no-knock warrant to enter Ms. Taylor’s apartment on March 13, the officer, Brett Hankison, blindly fired 10 rounds into a covered patio door and a window, according to a termination letter released by the Louisville Metro Police Department on Friday.

“I find your conduct a shock to the conscience,” Police Chief Robert J. Schroeder wrote. “I am alarmed and stunned you used deadly force in this fashion. You have never been trained by the Louisville Metro Police Department to use deadly force in this fashion.”

The killing of Ms. Taylor, 26, a black emergency medical technician, has for weeks fueled widespread protests and escalating questions about why further action had not been taken against the officers, who have not been charged. Those questions intensified last week when the police released a four-page incident report of Ms. Taylor’s death, containing minimal details and aberrations, including listing “none” under victim injuries even though officers shot her at least eight times.

The other officers involved in the case — Jon Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove — have been placed on administrative reassignment.

Before being formally fired, Officer Hankison will have the opportunity to respond to the proposed firing, according to the termination letter. It was not immediately clear which lawyer was representing him.

The decision to move forward with criminal charges now rests with the attorney general, Lonita Baker, a lawyer for Ms. Taylor’s family, said. “Based on the content of the letter, it’s our position that there’s enough to move forward with criminal charges against him,” she said.

The attorney general’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.

The case has drawn fierce scrutiny, leading city officials to ban the use of no-knock warrants, a contentious police practice that allows officers to forcibly enter homes to search them without warning. Officers said they did announce themselves, but Ms. Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, said he did not hear an announcement of police — just aggressive banging on the door — when he fired his gun, striking an officer in the leg.

Officers fired back, killing Ms. Taylor.

The police were investigating two men who they believed were selling drugs out of a different house, but a judge also signed a warrant allowing the police to search Ms. Taylor’s residence because the police said they believed that one of the two men had used her apartment to receive packages.

No drugs were found in the apartment, a lawyer for Mr. Walker said.

The Department of Homeland Security deployed helicopters, airplanes and drones over 15 cities where demonstrators gathered to protest police violence following the death of George Floyd, logging at least 270 hours of surveillance data, far more than previously revealed, according to Customs and Border Protection data.

The department’s dispatching of unmanned aircraft over protests in Minneapolis last month sparked a congressional inquiry and widespread accusations that the federal agency had infringed on the privacy rights of demonstrators.

But that was just one piece of a nationwide operation that deployed resources usually used to patrol the U.S. border for smugglers and illegal crossings. Aircraft filmed demonstrations in New York, Buffalo, Philadelphia and Dayton, Ohio, among other cities, sending video footage in real time to control centers managed by Air and Marine Operations, a branch of Customs and Border Protection.

The footage was then fed into a digital network managed by the Homeland Security Department, called “Big Pipe,” which can be accessed by other federal agencies and local police departments for use in future investigations, according to senior officials with Air and Marine Operations.

Directed to fly no lower than 19,000 feet, the drones can track movements of protesters or looters, direct law enforcement on the ground and see if someone is wearing a backpack or rifle. Stored footage could be accessed later to corroborate investigative findings, such as a witness account that a fire was set at a given time by a small group, or the escape route of a suspect.

“You see an aircraft, you have no idea currently what technologies that aircraft is carrying,” said Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union. “There is something militaristic and dominating about a militarized police aircraft hovering over you when you’re out there protesting police abuse.” 

Archivists in Washington, D.C., made a timely discovery this week: the original handwritten Union Army record of an order that brought emancipation to enslaved people in Texas at the end of the Civil War.

General Order No. 3 was read aloud by a Union officer, Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger, in Galveston on June 19, 1865, to inform Texans that all enslaved people in the state were free. That date, which became known as Juneteenth, has been celebrated ever since.

But the handwritten record had been buried in a leather-bound book at the National Archives in Washington, with its location largely unknown — even though, for decades, the book has been available to researchers to leaf through upon request.

The discovery was spurred by Michael Davis, a public affairs specialist for the National Archives who was writing a piece about the history of the holiday.

“In light of what has happened recently in our nation with police brutality, I wanted to make sure that we highlighted Juneteenth,” Mr. Davis said in an interview. He asked his colleagues if the archives had any documents from that day in 1865, hoping to find something but not sure that he would.

Trevor K. Plante, the director of archival operations at the National Archives building in Washington, zeroed in on the Union Army records from Texas. And on Thursday, in the stacks on the 10th tier of the building’s west side, he found a leather-bound book with a June 19 entry in neat cursive.

“The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free,” it said. “This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor.” 

The Atlanta Police Department released hundreds of pages of records on Friday unfurling the disciplinary histories of the two officers charged this week in connection with the fatal shooting of Rayshard Brooks.

The trove of documents showed that Garrett Rolfe, who has been fired and charged with murder, had few serious disciplinary issues before encountering Mr. Brooks a week ago in a Wendy’s parking lot.

Mr. Rolfe, who joined the police force in 2013, received a written reprimand for a 2016 incident in which he pointed his weapon out of the passenger window of a patrol car while in pursuit of a vehicle, according to the records.

In a statement to Police Department investigators, Mr. Rolfe said he had reason to believe that the people inside the car could be armed and could flee.

“I was not intentionally pointing at any particular occupant in the vehicle,” he said, “but I had my weapon trained on the vehicle and my finger was off the trigger the entire time. I made a split-second decision in a very dynamic situation.”

There were two complaints accusing Mr. Rolfe of racial profiling, but investigations found no evidence supporting the claims. Efforts on Friday to reach the men who lodged the complaints were unsuccessful.

Mr. Rolfe was also reprimanded twice for minor vehicular accidents, according to the records.

The other officer involved in the fatal confrontation with Mr. Brooks, Devin Brosnan, joined the department in 2018 and did not have any previous disciplinary issues, records show.

Officer Brosnan has been charged with aggravated assault and violations of his oath and placed on administrative duty. In a statement, his lawyers called the decision by the Fulton County district attorney to bring the charges “irrational and obviously based on factors which should have nothing to do with the proper administration of justice.”

Mr. Rolfe was charged on 11 counts, including felony murder and aggravated assault, and was denied bond by a judge on Friday. He maintains his innocence. “While Rayshard Brooks’s death was tragic, Officer Garrett Rolfe’s actions were justified under Georgia law,” his lawyer, Noah H. Pines, said in a statement. 

Hundreds of people gathered in Tulsa on Friday along Greenwood Avenue — the site of one of America’s worst racist attacks — to celebrate Juneteenth, the holiday that commemorates when enslaved black Americans in Texas formally learned of emancipation.

In any year, Juneteenth in Tulsa means something different than it does in other cities, falling against the backdrop of the 1921 white riot that killed an estimated 300 black Tulsans and destroyed the area once known as “Black Wall Street.”

“We’re celebrating the emancipation of slaves, but we’re really celebrating the idea of being black,” said Jacquelyn Simmons, who has lived in Tulsa for 45 years. “We love it and we love us.”

Organizers had planned to cancel their annual Juneteenth celebration amid the national coronavirus pandemic. Then President Trump announced a campaign rally in the city, originally slated to be held on the Friday holiday but later moved to Saturday evening.

With that event looming, what was typically a celebration of resilience transformed into one of defiance. “Black Lives Matter” was painted in bright yellow letters across Greenwood Avenue.

“It’s not really about his rally for us,” said Otis Collins, 51, who drove more than four hours to Tulsa from Dallas. “We want to show defiance to his act, but he’s going to have his rally and do his thing regardless.”

At the celebration on Friday, officially titled “I, too, am America: Juneteenth for Justice,” a racially diverse crowd saw a link between past and present, a through line between the white anger that once set Greenwood Avenue ablaze and the coalition that elected Mr. Trump after eight years of Barack Obama, the nation’s first black president.

Charman Sanders, 70, a black Tulsa resident whose family in the region dates back to 1921, said there was no way to see Mr. Trump’s actions as anything other than “disrespectful.”

Relatives of black Americans killed by police officers say they are marking this year’s Juneteenth with a renewed sense of purpose: to celebrate the memory of their loved ones and to continue a fight against racial injustice.

The family of Atatiana Jefferson, who was in her home playing video games with her nephew when she was fatally shot through a window by a white Fort Worth police officer last year, plans to host an event Friday at the home where she was killed.

It will be the formal unveiling of the Atatiana Project, an organization aimed at promoting science, technology, engineering and math to young children. Ms. Jefferson, 28, had studied biology in college and had hoped to become a doctor.

Ashley Carr, a sister, said she and her siblings intend to turn the Fort Worth house where Ms. Jefferson was killed into a headquarters for the organization and a gaming center for children.

Ms. Carr said that the last several weeks of protests had affirmed her anger over the death of her sister, who was killed by the officer after a neighbor called a nonemergency line seeking a welfare check. The officer, Aaron Y. Dean, has been charged with murder.

“It actually let me know that I’m not mad by myself,” Ms. Carr said, adding, “It helps with the wound.”

In Tulsa, the family of Terence Crutcher, who was unarmed when he was fatally shot by a white police officer in 2016, has helped to organize the city’s Juneteenth celebration, where thousands are expected to gather for music, poetry and calls for justice.

“We will be rallying with a purpose,” Mr. Crutcher’s sister, Tiffany Crutcher, said in an interview.

Mr. Crutcher, 40, was fatally shot during an encounter with the police, after he could be seen on video raising his hands above his head. The officer, Betty Shelby, who said she thought he may have been reaching for a weapon, was acquitted.

In recent days, the mayor apologized for comments he made playing down the role of race in the Mr. Crutcher’s fatal encounter with the police, and the Tulsa police department has been grappling with growing criticism. The police recently announced an inquiry into the forceful arrest of a black teenager who was accused of jaywalking, and a Tulsa police officer came under fire for a radio interview, in which he said that police officers were “shooting African-Americans about 24 percent less than we probably ought to be, based on the crimes being committed.”

“Even though we commemorate the Emancipation Proclamation, the reality is in 2020, we still aren’t free,” Ms. Crutcher said.

On the eve of Juneteenth, President Trump used a manipulated, fake video and a second, slickly produced, campaign-style ad to accuse the news media of inventing racism where it does not exist.

The pair of videos appeared to be designed to push the idea that Trump supporters are falsely accused of being racists, a message that was echoed by Brad Parscale, the president’s 2020 campaign manager, in an appearance on Fox News.

“They want that moment where CNN or some other fake news media can try to make it look like a Trump supporter is not a loving, caring person,” Mr. Parscale said, referencing the videos.

Mr. Trump tweeted out a video Thursday night that purported to show a clip from CNN in which a black toddler is shown running from a white toddler as ominous music plays in the background. The label, or chyron, at the bottom reads: “BREAKING NEWS: TERRIFIED TODLER RUNS FROM RACIST BABY.”

The Trump video goes on to show that the two children were in fact playing happily together. It ends by saying: AMERICA IS NOT THE PROBLEM. FAKE NEWS IS.”

In fact, the video itself is fake. The CNN chyron — including the misspelled word “todler” — never existed and the original CNN video manipulated in the ad reported about the joy between the two young children.

Twitter flagged the president’s tweet with a “manipulated media” warning that says, “Video being shared of CNN report on toddlers is doctored, journalists confirm.”

The second video that Mr. Trump tweeted Thursday night accuses liberals and the news media of assuming that Trump supporters are racists. It shows a woman posting a video of a white man wearing a Make America Great Hat yelling “go, go” at the black driver of a car.

“My racist neighbor just chased my BLACK Uber driver out of our neighborhood,” the woman writes on a social media site, with the hashtags: MAGA, Racist and Love Trumps Hate.

In the video, her posting goes viral, with more than 1.6 million views and reactions from people blaming Mr. Trump and calling him “a Nazi.”

The video also appears to use a fake CNN chyron saying “WHITE MAN IN MAGA HAT ATTACKS BLACK UBER DRIVER.”

The staged video then reveals that the white man had been helping the driver out of a patch of ice by pushing the car, and was yelling “go, go” so it wouldn’t get stuck again.

How Progressive Candidates of Color Are Building Winning Coalitions,"Welcome to Poll Watch, our weekly look at polling data and survey research on the candidates, voters and issues that will shape the 2020 election.

Just last month, it looked as if Amy McGrath would coast to the Democratic Senate nomination in Kentucky. A moderate former fighter pilot with strong backing from the party establishment, she had raised over $40 million, far more than all her competitors combined. From her TV ads, you would have thought she was already running against Senator Mitch McConnell in the general election.

But then came weeks of protests for racial justice, and a flush of new energy on the party’s left wing. Charles Booker, a state legislator endorsed by the likes of Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, had been campaigning on a platform of “Medicare for all,” the Green New Deal and bold police reform; he surged in the weeks before Tuesday’s election.

On Thursday, after a new batch of preliminary results were released, Mr. Booker held a 3.5-percentage-point lead over Ms. McGrath, although most absentee ballots haven’t been counted yet and we may not know who won the race for days.

As swift and dramatic as Mr. Booker’s rise has been, it’s part of an ongoing trend in Democratic politics — one that’s been a long time in the making, according to polling on political attitudes.

In congressional races across the country this year, candidates of color are assembling coalitions that bring together liberal white voters and voters of color, picking up where Mr. Sanders’s unsuccessful presidential run left off and building support in areas where he was never fully able to.

“The task going forward for progressives is combining the African-American and Latino base with white progressives in increasingly diverse districts,” Sean McElwee, the founder of the left-leaning polling firm Data for Progress, said in an interview.

“The way progressives win is to find progressive candidates of color who can build trust with voters of color and then can win over white progressives,” he said.

That dynamic played out this week in congressional races around New York, where three black progressives — Jamaal Bowman, Mondaire Jones and Ritchie Torres — appeared on track to defeat their more moderate foes.

Mr. Bowman, a middle school principal who campaigned on a racial-justice platform, held a wide lead Friday morning over Eliot L. Engel, a 30-year incumbent. Mr. Engel is white; his district, which includes parts of the Bronx and nearby suburbs, is about one-third black, one-third white and one-quarter Latino.

Mr. Bowman held decisive leads in both Westchester County, which is predominantly white, and the Bronx, which is heavily black and Hispanic.

“The interests are aligned,” Mr. Bowman said in an interview, referring to his varied racial constituencies. “They are aligned more urgently because of the moment that we are living in, but even prior to the moment, we all centered this work in our common humanity and our values around equality and justice for everyone.”

For years, polling shows, black voters have been broadly supportive of liberal policies such as universal government health care and free tuition to public colleges. That’s only becoming more true as millennials and members of Generation Z account for an increasing share of the electorate.

Black voters are among the most likely to name health care as a key voting issue, according to PRRI polling.

And data suggest that as some particularly left-wing ideas move from the party’s fringe into its mainstream, they are being carried there by a coalition of voters of color and some white progressives.

Among people of color younger than 45, fully 81 percent expressed support for the Green New Deal, according to an aggregate of NPR/PBS/Marist College polling from last year provided to The New York Times.

Two out of three of these younger adults of color backed making public colleges and universities tuition-free, and 65 percent supported instituting a tax on wealth over $1 million.

On each of those issues, white people under 45 were also broadly in support, though not in equally high numbers, according to the NPR/PBS/Marist data. But among progressives, support ran considerably higher.

Candidates of color in many states are building winning coalitions around staunchly progressive platforms with messages of racial justice and representation at their center.

The road was paved in many ways in 2018, when Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Representatives Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar and Ayanna S. Pressley beat out establishment Democrats. Each of them combined a progressive policy vision with a localized approach to campaigning, often rooted in community identity.

This year, in New Mexico, Teresa Leger Fernandez campaigned in support of the Green New Deal and Medicare for all. She beat Valerie Plame, the establishment-backed Democratic candidate, in a primary in a heavily Latino congressional district.

Candace Valenzuela of Texas and Georgette Gómez of California are each Hispanic congressional candidates who have been endorsed by high-profile progressives; both are headed to runoffs after advancing in their respective Democratic primaries.

Even in whiter areas, candidates are finding that Democratic voters are receptive to campaigns that put calls for racial justice at the center.

In Kentucky, analyzing only the 10 counties where the most votes have been counted thus far, Mr. Booker’s support tends to run higher in counties with larger black populations, suggesting that he is indeed drawing crucial support from African-American voters.

If the current numbers hold, he will have won all three of the large counties in which black people make up at least 10 percent of the population, while losing to Ms. McGrath in the more overwhelmingly white areas.

But roughly four in five Kentucky Democrats are white, and Mr. Booker could not be performing strongly without meaningful support from white progressives.

Years before the current wave of protests against systemic racism and police brutality, polling showed that white liberals, influenced by the Black Lives Matter movement, were beginning to express far greater concern about the nation’s legacy of racism.

But something key has changed in the past few weeks: A wider swath of voters now expect candidates to put bold proposals for racial justice at the center of their platforms.

No less than 96 percent of Democrats in a recent Monmouth University poll said they saw racism as a big problem. And in a New York Times/Siena College national poll released this week, 74 percent of Democrats expressed a “very favorable” view of the Black Lives Matter movement. That’s roughly on par with the 77 percent of black people who said so.

In that poll, more than four in five Democrats across races said they supported the protests.

The call by protesters to defund the police is less popular, though the concept is still a relatively new entrant into mainstream political discourse. Just 14 percent of Americans said in a Quinnipiac University poll this month that they supported scrapping their local police department and replacing it with a new one.

But 41 percent — including 62 percent of black people and 70 percent of Democrats across races — said they would like to see some funding cut from the police and rerouted to social services.

So You Want to Learn About Juneteenth?,"Juneteenth, an annual holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the United States, has been celebrated by African-Americans since the late 1800s.

But in recent years, and particularly following nationwide protests over police brutality and the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and other African-Americans this year, there is a renewed interest in the day that celebrates freedom.

This year’s celebration may resonate in new ways, given the sweeping changes and widespread protests across the U.S. President Trump had planned to hold a campaign rally in Tulsa, Okla., on the holiday, June 19. Late last week, Mr. Trump, bowing to pressure, announced that he would delay it for one day.

Here’s a brief guide to what you should know about Juneteenth.

On June 19, 1865, about two months after the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox, Va., Union Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, to inform enslaved African-Americans of their freedom and that the Civil War had ended. General Granger’s announcement put into effect the Emancipation Proclamation, which had been issued more than two and a half years earlier on Jan. 1, 1863, by President Abraham Lincoln.

The holiday received its name by combining June and 19. The day is also sometimes called “Juneteenth Independence Day,” “Freedom Day” or “Emancipation Day.”

The original celebration became an annual one, and it grew in popularity over the years with the addition of descendants, according to Juneteenth.com, which tracks celebrations. The day was celebrated by praying and bringing families together. In some celebrations on this day, men and women who had been enslaved, and their descendants, made an annual pilgrimage back to Galveston.

Celebrations reached new heights in 1872, when a group of African-American ministers and businessmen in Houston purchased 10 acres of land and created Emancipation Park. The space was intended to hold the city’s annual Juneteenth celebration.

Today, while some celebrations take place among families in backyards where food is an integral element, some cities, like Atlanta and Washington, hold larger events, like parades and festivals with residents, local businesses and more.

Galveston has remained a busy site for Juneteenth events over the years, said Douglas Matthews, who has helped coordinate them for more than two decades. He said the city usually has about 15 events, including parades, barbecues, musical performances and a beauty contest, beginning in the first week of June. Combined, the events draw about 10,000 people in total, he said.

“This year, there’s only probably about two or three events because of the coronavirus epidemic,” he said. “We’re just happy with the significance of our Juneteenth anniversary.”

In 1980, Texas became the first state to designate Juneteenth as a holiday, though the recognition is largely symbolic. Since then, 45 other states and the District of Columbia have moved to officially recognize the day. In 2019, New Hampshire became the latest state to declare Juneteenth a state holiday. On Tuesday, Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia said he would propose legislation to make Juneteenth a paid state holiday and on Wednesday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York declared the anniversary a holiday for state employees.

Also this month, Twitter and Square, a mobile payment company, designated Juneteenth as a company holiday. Jack Dorsey, the chief executive and a founder of Twitter and Square, said the day was for “celebration, education, and connection.” Vox Media, Nike, the N.F.L., Best Buy and Target have also made similar announcements, joining others in making the celebration a paid day off. Capital One said its offices and bank branches would close early on that day.

But so far, it has fallen short of becoming a national holiday. There are several online petitions calling for the change, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont also called for it to become a national holiday in 2019 when he recognized Opal Lee, an activist in Fort Worth who campaigns for the cause. In 2018, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution designating June 19 as “Juneteenth Independence Day,” but it has not yet reached the House.

Following the filmed killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man who died in the custody of the Minneapolis Police last month, thousands of people around the U.S. have poured onto the streets in protest. Mr. Floyd’s name, as well as the names of Ms. Taylor, Mr. Arbery, David McAtee and others, have become rallying cries for change across the country, effectively re-energizing the Black Lives Matter movement.

That change has come in waves. In Minneapolis, officials banned the use of chokeholds and strangleholds by police, and said officers must intervene and report any use of unauthorized force.

Democrats in Congress unveiled sweeping legislation targeting misconduct and racial discrimination by the police. The bill is the most expansive intervention into policing that lawmakers have proposed in recent memory.

Companies across the business spectrum have voiced support of the Black Lives Matter movement and have either suspended or fired employees who mocked Mr. Floyd’s death or made racists remarks.

Mark Anthony Neal, an African-American studies scholar at Duke University, said there are some comparisons between the end of the Civil War to current unrest, adding that this moment feels like a “rupture.”

“The stakes are a little different,” Mr. Neal said. “Many African-Africans, black Americans, feels as though this is the first time in a long time that they have been heard in a way across the culture.”

“I think Juneteenth feels a little different now,” he said. “It’s an opportunity for folks to kind catch their breath about what has been this incredible pace of change and shifting that we’ve seen over the last couple of weeks.”

For the first time since the coronavirus outbreak shut down most of the country, Mr. Trump will return to the campaign trail. He had planned a rally in Tulsa on June 19. In 1921, the city was the site of one of country’s worst episodes of racist violence, when white mobs attacked a wealthy black business district known as Black Wall Street. The mobs destroyed more than 1,200 homes and killed as many as 300 people.

The announcement drew ire from Mr. Trump’s critics. “This isn’t just a wink to white supremacists — he’s throwing them a welcome home party,” Senator Kamala Harris of California tweeted. In response to the backlash, Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, touted Mr. Trump’s “solid record of success” for African-Americans.

Asked in an interview with Fox News on Friday if the rally was set on June 19 on purpose, Mr. Trump said no. “The fact that I’m having a rally on that day, you can really think about that very positively as a celebration,” he said, adding, “It wasn’t done for that reason. But it’s an interesting date.”

Melanye Price, a political science professor at Prairie View A&M University, a historically black university in Texas, called the planned rally on Juneteenth a “slap in the face.”

“In the middle of the largest protests we have ever seen in this country about racial justice, he shows up in a town on a day that is meant to celebrate racial freedom and liberation, in a town where the black population was decimated by racial prejudice and white supremacy,” Ms. Price said. “Who doesn’t see this as a problem?”

Late Friday night, in a Tweet just before midnight, the president announced that the rally would be held the following day instead.

“We had previously scheduled our #MAGA Rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for June 19th — a big deal,” he wrote. “Unfortunately, however, this would fall on the Juneteenth Holiday. Many of my African-American friends and supporters have reached out to suggest that we consider changing the date out of respect for this Holiday, and in observance of this important occasion and all that it represents. I have therefore decided to move our rally to Saturday, June 20th, in order to honor their requests.”

"From Sacramento to San Diego, Californians Join Protests","Good morning.

(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)

Over the weekend, in at least 140 cities across the country, demonstrators took to the streets in outpourings of grief and rage over the death of George Floyd, a black Minneapolis man who, before he died, pleaded with the white police officer who had pinned him to the ground with a knee on his neck.

“I can’t breathe,” he can be heard saying in a graphic video.

[See photos of the protests around the nation.]

In California — despite Gov. Gavin Newsom’s support of the demonstrations and assurances about the will to better address systemic racism — widespread protests sparked by Mr. Floyd’s death were yet another reminder that the state’s progressive politics haven’t healed deep wounds in black and Latino communities, which continue to be the targets of disproportionate policing here, just as they are in other parts of the country.

And so, Californians in cities large and small joined the protests. Many of the demonstrations started peacefully and became violent, with widespread looting. Hundreds have been arrested.

It’s not comprehensive, but here’s a look at some of what happened:

Protests in Los Angeles

In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti at first reassured Angelenos that he wouldn’t call in the National Guard, although demonstrations downtown had taken a destructive turn.

“This is not 1992,” he said, referencing the riots that year spurred by Los Angeles police officers’ beating of Rodney King.

[Read about how past presidents responded to protests against police brutality.]

But by Saturday afternoon, after police officers and demonstrators clashed in the city’s upscale Fairfax district, Mr. Garcetti reversed course. He announced an overnight curfew.

Mr. Newsom declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles County.

And as the sun rose Sunday, for the first time since 1992, National Guard troops patrolled Los Angeles’s streets.

The Los Angeles Times reported that for many black Angelenos, the current moment bears similarities to that era. But as one resident told the paper: “It’s worse today than it was back then.”

Later on Sunday, while many peacefully marched in Santa Monica and Long Beach, looters ransacked department stores and smashed windows.

Officials announced another Los Angeles countywide curfew on Sunday night roughly an hour before it was set to go into effect.

Protests in the Bay Area

In Oakland, the legacy of Oscar Grant III loomed large over the weekend’s unrest.

When Mr. Grant was killed by a transit officer at the Fruitvale BART station on New Year’s Day in 2009, the outrage that followed has been widely cited as a kind of antecedent to the Black Lives Matter movement.

NBC Bay Area reported that Mr. Grant’s mother, Wanda Johnson, spoke about the compounding trauma for black Americans: “We’re fighting the pandemic and we’re fighting this issue of hate,” she said.

As The San Francisco Chronicle reported, the pain inflicted by the pandemic was just one of several reasons this week’s protests have been more “explosive” in the Bay Area.

On Friday, during protests, two officers were shot while protecting Oakland’s federal courthouse — one fatally. Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, called the shooting an act of domestic terrorism.

Violence and looting — the latter rising especially on Sunday — erupted in other Bay Area cities, like San Jose, Walnut Creek and Danville, which The Mercury News reported implemented curfews.

Protests in the Central Valley and the Inland Empire

While demonstrations had some tense moments, protests in the Central Valley and Inland Empire largely remained calm, according to The Fresno Bee and The Press-Enterprise.

There were, however exceptions: In at least two instances, passing drivers appeared to target protesters.

In Bakersfield — the seat of Kern County, where The Guardian once reported the police killed more people per capita than anywhere else in the country — a 31-year-old man was arrested after the authorities say he drove through a crowd of protesters and struck a 15-year-old girl, according to KGET.

In Visalia, officials were investigating an incident on Saturday in which a person driving a blue Jeep flying flags supportive of President Trump struck two Black Lives Matter protesters, according to The Visalia Times Delta.

Protests around San Diego

In La Mesa, a small city in San Diego County, a crowd that had gathered in what started out as a peaceful protest on Saturday eventually blocked Interstate 8, set two banks ablaze and damaged City Hall, according to The San Diego Union-Tribune.

Protesters said they were gathering in solidarity with those in Minneapolis, but they also aimed to draw attention to what they said was the unfair detention last week of a black man by a white officer at a transit station in an encounter that was captured on video.

Protests in Sacramento

And in the state’s capital, what started as peaceful demonstrations on Friday, Saturday and Sunday deteriorated into chaos, according to The Sacramento Bee. Police officers shot rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters; looters left behind a trail of destruction in the heart of the city.

Mr. Floyd’s death touched a particular nerve there, according to CapRadio, following the death of Stephon Clark, an unarmed young black man who was gunned down in his grandmother’s backyard in 2018 when the police mistook a cellphone he was holding for a gun.

The fury over his death was a driving force behind the state’s passage last year of landmark legislation that makes it easier to prosecute police officers who kill people on the job by raising the standard for the use of deadly force.

[Read more about the death of Stephon Clark, and the law he inspired.]

Supporters of the measure have said it makes California’s police use-of-force laws some of the strictest in the nation.

Still, the officers who shot Mr. Clark were never charged in his death.

In a time like this, words often feel insufficient. But there are other ways to support black communities, and not just in times of crisis.

They Fled Asia as Refugees. Now They Are Caught in the Middle of Minneapolis.,"They came as refugees from the jungles of Laos, an ethnic minority allied with American forces during the war in Vietnam. Beginning in the winter of 1975, thousands settled in frigid central Minnesota, and eventually became business owners, teachers and police officers —their versions of the American dream.

They are Hmong-Americans, and in the week since George Floyd died in police custody in Minneapolis, they have found themselves in the middle of a national conflagration over race that was bigger than many have seen in their lifetimes as Americans.

One of the police officers who stood by as Mr. Floyd was pressed to the ground was Hmong-American. So was the wife of Derek Chauvin, the officer who put his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck, who last week filed for a divorce. A number of the businesses burned in the looting belonged to Hmong-Americans. The result has been a fraught descent into the nation’s battles over race and equality and a sense that, whether they want to or not, they have been drawn into the conflict.

“We came to this country with nothing,” said Gloria Wong, 50, whose building on University Avenue in St. Paul was badly damaged. “I have been working my whole life for my building. Now it just takes one or two persons to trash it. I feel very down right now. My heart is just aching all over.”

Ms. Wong said she had a fondness for police officers: Her uncle was one of the first Hmong-Americans to become one in the 1980s. But when she saw the video, she thought that Tou Thao, the officer who stood by during Mr. Floyd’s death, had acted wrongly. 

“I thought he had neglected what he went to law enforcement school for,” Ms. Wong said. Still, she understood why he had attended. His family, she said, was also striving. 

“They were trying to work hard and rise up and have the American dream too,” she said. 

Hmong-Americans do not fit cleanly into the country’s broad racial categories. Because so many came as impoverished refugees, they are more likely to be poor than many other Asian immigrants from places like China and India who often have specialized degrees. 

An ethnic minority in Laos, they were recruited by the United States to help disrupt supply lines and fight against communists in Southeast Asia. After the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, they settled around the Twin Cities, Milwaukee and Fresno, Calif., starting out with very little as they tried to establish roots. 

Chy Nou Lee, a deputy sheriff in the Ramsey County Sheriff’s Department, said he grew up in public housing. Inspector Lee said his father had fought alongside Americans, a role he was proud of, so the career choice of police officer seemed natural. 

Becoming a police officer “kind of extends from the older community back in Laos,” said Inspector Lee, the highest-ranking Hmong-American officer in Minnesota. “If you work for the military or government, you have huge stature. That mentality is built into the culture.”

It was something more too, he said: A way to feel less like an outsider looking in. 

“It’s starting to say, ‘Hey, we have a voice in this society,’” he said. 

Inspector Lee, who is 37, said he did not know Mr. Thao, the Hmong officer who stood by during Mr. Floyd’s death, and did not want to debate his actions. 

But he added: “I want to see justice brought for Mr. Floyd.” 

Inspector Lee was born in the United States. For newer immigrants, the week’s events were even more bewildering. 

Kongsue Xiong, 46, a Hmong business owner in St. Paul whose building was damaged last week, said the burning reminded him of his childhood in Laos. He said he hid in the jungle as a child and saw people dying, and communist forces burning villages. He came to the United States in 1992 alone. His father had been killed in the violence and his mother, who had survived, had remarried and did not want to immigrate.

“What happened to George Floyd is not right,” he said. “But burning businesses is not related to the death. Two things are going on at the same time and you are just confused.”

He said the past week has made him “as scared of Black Lives Matter as of the police.”

Hmong-Americans are the single largest group of Asians in Minnesota, with a population of up to 90,000. In St. Paul, Asians make up about 12 percent of the population, slightly less of than African-Americans, at about 13 percent. 

The community is divided on how it sees the week’s events, people said. Younger people tend to view it from the perspective of Black Lives Matter, saying that the outrage over police violence that had driven protesters into the streets was understandable. Older immigrants seemed more likely to emphasize the loss of property and the pain of watching a cherished small business destroyed. 

In St. Paul, a lot of the damage was concentrated on University Avenue, the center of Hmong business life, an area that had been transformed since the 1970s into a bustling shopping district. 

Mai Kou Vang, 42, a liquor store owner who lost all her merchandise to looting, said she felt like she had to choose a side — the protesters or immigrant business owners. 

 “But either side we choose,” she said, “it hurts us.”

The events come after several months in which Asians had experienced acts of bigotry related to the coronavirus. In May, an African-American youth kicked a Hmong woman who was sitting at a commuter rail station in St. Paul in the face, while another recorded with his phone and then posted on social media. 

Ms. Wong said her son, who had just graduated from high school and was working delivering groceries, had been harassed by customers because he was Asian. 

Hmong-Americans have also been victims of police violence. In 2006, a Minneapolis police officer shot and killed Fong Lee, 19. A jury later exonerated the officer.

On Sunday, Mr. Lee’s mother appeared at a protest in Minneapolis to encourage the Hmong community to stand with their black neighbors.

But the past week has also caused pain for some Hmong-Americans that is likely to linger. 

Rob Yang, 44, said Thursday was by far the strangest day of his life in the United States, since he came when he was 3. He stood watching in the afternoon sun as dozens of people walked into his shoe store and helped themselves to every last scrap of his merchandise. A black woman who tried to stop them was ignored. A white woman who tried was punched in the face. 

He said he had felt angry at the death of Mr. Floyd. He had posted about it on Facebook. But on Thursday he stood there, numb, unable to move away. 

“You know how people say, when you are about to die, things flash in front of your eyes?” he said. “I was thinking how hard I worked to get the store open and just how much work it was to live the American dream you know?”













"
‘A True Disappointment’: When Your First Pride March Is Canceled,"Colin Beresford was looking forward to the summer of 2020, and for the first time celebrating Pride among the crowds of people in Ann Arbor, Mich.

Mr. Beresford, 23, grew up in a conservative Michigan town and described a slow process of coming to understand that he was bisexual, to acknowledge that within himself, and finally to take pride in it.

“For me, it has been scary to accept myself,” he said. “I thought this year could be the year that I go and show myself, and everyone else, who I am. But, just like countless other things, that will have to wait.”

Pride marches and events have been canceled or postponed throughout the country this year because of the coronavirus, and many people like Mr. Beresford in the L.G.B.T.Q. community are missing out on an important moment of visibility and acceptance: their first Pride.

The Pride celebrations are not alone in being called off, but few other events are as much about being seen — by everyone.

“It’s something that’s so central to our identities as L.G.B.T.Q. folks,” said Fred Lopez, the executive director of San Francisco Pride. “To remember that time when we were able to walk hand in hand with a boyfriend or a crush, even amongst hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of people, is really inspiring.”

In place of the marches, parades and parties that have defined Pride in the United States, there will be small gatherings as cities begin to reopen, along with virtual celebrations this weekend. World leaders, human rights activists, musicians and drag queens will participate in a 24-hour online celebration that will be streamed on YouTube and the Global Pride website this weekend starting on Saturday.

But the importance of Pride as a public event that transforms city streets was underscored by readers who responded to The New York Times when asked what the loss of the large gatherings meant to them.

Susanna Yudkin said she had been to Pride marches in the past as an “ally,” but last year went for the first time as an openly queer woman. “Attending Denver Pride with my pride of fellow queer lionesses was nothing short of exhilarating,” she said, describing a newfound sense of belonging, as well as deep gratitude to those who came before her to make moments of open celebration possible.

Gregory Antollino said he still remembered what his first Pride, at the age of 23 in 1988, meant to him. He had just moved to New York City, had not yet connected with the gay community and unknowingly stumbled into a Pride parade.

“I made it a holiday,” he said. “Pride was joyous.”

He has since attended Pride in London, Lisbon and Amsterdam, and he said each experience was as “magical as those in my first years in New York.”

Neil Wu-Gibbs said his first Pride in 2013, when he marched with the Gay Asian & Pacific Islander Men of New York, gave him “a sense of belonging” that helped him decide to move back from Britain to New York City. “It was like a homecoming,” he said.

Though most Pride events were canceled in the spring over fears of large crowds spreading the coronavirus, mass gatherings have returned since Memorial Day in the form of protests in response to the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, Rayshard Brooks, Layleen Polanco and many others.

At many of the demonstrations, people have waved the rainbow L.G.B.T.Q. flag to honor Pride month — a reminder that the first Pride march 50 years ago was itself rooted in protest and followed the uprising against police brutality at the Stonewall Inn a year before.

And this month in Brooklyn, more than 15,000 people — wearing all white — rallied for a Black Trans Lives Matter demonstration, bringing attention to disproportionately high rates at which black trans people are killed and incarcerated, and highlighting the point that they do not always feel fully included in the Black Lives Matter movement.

For many in the L.G.B.T.Q. community, proclaiming their identities is not an easy undertaking. Many choose to come out in a public way, while others share who they are only with close family members and friends, and some never openly identify themselves as gay.

By her own account, it has taken Jennifer Depew, 23, a long time to accept herself as bisexual. She came out this month, she said, first to a friend and then to her family.

“I was looking forward to being able to celebrate Pride this year as someone fully comfortable with my identity, fully a member of the community,” Ms. Depew said. “To lose out on that opportunity this year is a true disappointment — another melancholic note of 2020.”

In countries where same-sex relationships are criminalized or homophobia is endorsed by the state, coming out publicly or celebrating Pride can come with grave risks.

The poet and essayist Chibuihe Obi Achimba, 27, grew up in a small village in southeastern Nigeria and for a long time struggled with being open about his sexuality.

In 2017, he wrote an essay titled “We’re Here, We’re Queer,” in which he detailed his experience with homophobia, spoke out against Nigeria’s laws that criminalize same-sex relationships, and described his longing to find positive L.G.B.T.Q. presentation in Nigerian literature. 

After the essay was published, Mr. Achimba said, he became the target of abuse and physical violence. He left Nigeria and came to the United States in 2019 as a fellow in the Harvard University Scholars at Risk program.

So 2020 looked like the year he had been waiting for all his adult life, and he was eager to join Pride, calling it “this global celebration of resistance, love, freedom, happiness and hope.”

“I planned to enact my own deliverance from the chokehold of my country’s state-sanctioned oppression and the sharp cudgels of my countrymen’s homophobia at this year’s Pride,” he said. “But now, we need to wade through the murky waters the coronavirus has stirred up.”

“It feels like a personal loss,” he added."
"In Los Angeles, the Ghosts of Rodney King and Watts Rise Again","LOS ANGELES — Patrisse Cullors was 8 in 1992, when Los Angeles erupted in riots after four police officers were acquitted of assault for the beating of Rodney King, which occurred outside a San Fernando Valley apartment building not far from where Ms. Cullors grew up.

“I was scared as hell,” she recalled. “As children, when we would see the police, our parents would tell us, ‘Behave, be quiet, don’t say anything.’ There was such fear of law enforcement in this city.”

With America seized by racial unrest, as protests convulse cities from coast to coast after the death of George Floyd, Los Angeles is on fire again. As peaceful protests in the city turned violent over the past few days, with images of looting and burning buildings captured by news helicopters shown late into the night, Ms. Cullors, like many Angelenos, was pulled back to the trauma of 1992.

The parallels are easy to see: looting and destruction, fueled by anger over police abuses; shopkeepers, with long guns, protecting their businesses. The differences, though, between 1992 and now, are stark. This time, the faces of the protesters are more diverse — black, white, Latino, Asian; there has been little if any racially motivated violence among Angelenos; and the geography of the chaos is very different, with protesters bringing their message to Los Angeles’ largely white and rich Westside.

“South Central has been completely quiet and peaceful,” said Ms. Cullors, now a prominent activist and co-founder of Black Lives Matter who organized a protest on Saturday in the Fairfax District, west of downtown. “That’s an important distinction, that these current situations are not happening in black communities.”

[Sign up for California Today, our daily newsletter from the Golden State.]

Los Angeles, in many ways, is America’s reference point for urban racial unrest, including the Watts riots in 1965 and the uprising in 1992. The Rodney King beating in 1991, captured on film, was one of the first viral videos of a black man being abused by the police, before cellphones even existed. In those uprisings, dozens of people were killed — 34 in 1965, and more than 40 in 1992.

Some of the most searing images from 1992 were of racially motivated violence on the streets — the beating of Reginald Denny, a white truck driver; gun battles between Korean shop owners and black looters. But the mayhem largely stayed in the historically black community of South Los Angeles and in Koreatown.

Now, organizers here say, they have very deliberately brought their anger to those they believe need to hear it the most: the white and the wealthy.

In 2013, when Black Lives Matter held its first demonstration in Los Angeles, it was in Beverly Hills.

“We launched it there because we said, ‘Hey, our community knows about this issue,’” Ms. Cullors said. “‘Let’s go into the heart of what is symbolically white in Los Angeles, which is Beverly Hills. These people need to hear our pain and our grief.’” Ms. Cullors added, “We wanted to bring this to communities who often aren’t dealing with police violence.”

The protest on Saturday in Fairfax stayed peaceful for hours before descending into chaos after confrontations with the police. Looters ransacked hip boutiques, running off with expensive sneakers. They looted expensive purses from Alexander McQueen and tagged graffiti on the walls and windows of Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, a symbol of privilege and luxury.

The people turning out this time are different as well. The first rocks and bottles hurled in the 1992 riots were in working-class black neighborhoods, where white and Hispanic bystanders were attacked. This time, the participants are mostly young and from diverse backgrounds and races.

In these protests, rage and anger over racism and police abuses have been compounded by outrage at another of America’s most profound issues — growing income inequality. In an annual countywide survey by the Luskin School of Public Affairs at University of California, Los Angeles, nearly two-thirds of residents under 40 said this year that the Los Angeles area was not a place where people who worked hard could succeed, but rather “a place where the rich keep getting richer, and the average person cannot get ahead.”

Erwin Chemerinsky, who in 1992 was a law professor in Los Angeles living in the Fairfax District and is now dean of the law school at University of California, Berkeley, said he remembered explaining to his children what was happening in 1992.

Now, he said, they are calling him from L.A. about new images on CNN of burned-out cars and broken storefronts, stretching far more deeply into their neighborhood than last time.

“It’s just sad,” Mr. Chemerinsky said. “It’s sad that the police violence against African-Americans continues in the same way that precipitated riots in the 1960s. It’s sad that we have this enormous economic disparity that has made people so desperate. It’s sad that there is so much anger and that we are so divided.""

For city and county officials in Los Angeles struggling to contain the violence, the trauma of 1992 never fully healed and has rarely been far from mind in recent days.

Hours before the city erupted in violence over the weekend, Mayor Eric M. Garcetti tried to assure his anxious city, saying he would not need to call on the National Guard.

“This is not 1992,” he said.

A few hours later, with chaos growing, Mr. Garcetti was on the phone with Gov. Gavin Newsom, asking him to send in the Guard. Mr. Garcetti made a point to say that they would not be patrolling South Los Angeles — now predominantly Latino — an acknowledgment of the painful history, but also largely a moot point because the streets there have been calm.

“I think it’s very different from 1992 because this is a collective national pain,” Mr. Garcetti said in an interview. “It happened in Minneapolis on top of an incident in Louisville on top of an incident in Georgia.”

In 1965, Mark Ridley-Thomas was an 11-year-old boy, standing on the corner of Vernon and Hooper in South Los Angeles, watching the National Guard roll through his neighborhood.

In 1992, as a first-term City Council member, he was at the First A.M.E. Church awaiting the verdict in the Rodney King case. On Saturday night, Mr. Ridley-Thomas, who is African-American and a member of the powerful county board of supervisors, was at home because of the pandemic watching the footage on television, and thinking about history.

“The locus of the crisis was not pinpointed in Los Angeles,” he said, of Mr. Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. “So there’s some real differences, but the pain, the hurt, the disgust, the frustration, the anger is real and is cumulative. So it’s not hard for people to reach back to ’92 and many events since that time.”

When the officers use kicks, chokeholds, punches, takedowns, Mace spray, Tasers and the like, the person subject to that force is black about 60 percent of the time.

George Gascon, who was a 38-year-old L.A.P.D. sergeant on the ground in South Central in 1992, when the riots erupted at the corner of Florence and Normandie, said he was, “brokenhearted” over the weekend watching the television footage.

After the 1992 unrest and the Rampart corruption scandal, the L.A.P.D. underwent a number of reforms and improved relationships with black and brown communities. But the city still faces accusations of abuse, and to this day, police officers are rarely prosecuted for shootings — the last time an officer faced charges was in 2000.

“At the end of the day, as soon as the dust settles, as soon as the fires are put out and the broken glass is fixed,” Mr. Gascon said, “we go back to business as usual. And we go back to giving a pass over and over and over again to a broken policing system.”

He added, “Floyd was definitely the spark, but I can tell you that there are many Floyds in L.A. County happening all the time, just as there are in other parts of the country.”

On Sunday, the protests moved further west, reaching Santa Monica, just on the ocean.

Jaaye Person-Lynn, a lawyer who was out protesting there on Sunday, was mindful of the history of Watts and Rodney King and said in an interview with Spectrum News 1, a local news channel, that this time was different.

“Now we are right here on the water,” he told Spectrum. “We can’t get any further west.”

And he vowed that protesters would continue to bring their voice to enclaves of white privilege.

“We’re going to start hitting these farmers’ markets right where people are most comfortable,” he said. “While they are buying their gluten-free bread and their organic tomatoes, they’re going to have to feel it the same way we do.”

Air Force Sergeant With Ties to Extremist Group Charged in Federal Officer’s Death,"An Air Force sergeant linked to an anti-government movement was charged with murder and attempted murder on Tuesday in the shooting death of a federal security officer outside a courthouse in Oakland, Calif., last month.

The sergeant had expressed his allegiance to the so-called boogaloo movement by writing with his own blood on the hood of a white Toyota Camry and had used the recent protests against racial injustice as a cover to attack law enforcement, according to the F.B.I.

Staff Sgt. Steven Carrillo, 32, is accused of firing an assault rifle from the open back door of a moving vehicle and gunning down the federal officer, according to the criminal complaint.

The driver of the van, Robert Alvin Justus Jr., 30, who had met Sergeant Carrillo on Facebook, was charged with aiding and abetting the murder of Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, the officer killed in the shooting, the complaint said. Both men were also charged with the attempted murder of a second officer who was gravely wounded.

“They came to Oakland to kill cops,” John F. Bennett, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I. in San Francisco, said at a news conference on Tuesday.

Evidence tied Sergeant Carrillo to the boogaloo, an extremist ideology that seeks to bring about a second civil war to overthrow the United States government.

Sergeant Carrillo had previously been charged with the shooting death of a sheriff’s deputy in Santa Cruz County during a gun battle on June 6 that led to his arrest.

In that showdown, Sergeant Carrillo used his own blood to scrawl “Boog” and other phrases linked to the movement on the hood of the car he had stolen.

Sergeant Carrillo is the latest person tied to the movement to be arrested in recent weeks. All of them have sought to exploit protests — first against the coronavirus lockdowns and then around the death of George Floyd in police custody — to accelerate their apocalyptic vision.

The term, initially derived as an inside joke from the 1984 cult classic film “Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo,” is used as shorthand on internet forums for a brewing second civil war.

However, boogaloo does not represent a cohesive or singular ideology. It has been connected to what some consider humorous memes, as well as with occasional physical violence and militaristic shows of force (similarly to armed militias such as the Oath Keepers or III Percenters).

The reference migrated offline from social media platforms like Reddit, 4chan and Facebook with volatile speed in recent months. Adherents often wear distinctive Hawaiian shirts, a reference to the fact that they sometimes transform their name into the “Big Luau” or the “Big Igloo.”

Subscribing to the boogaloo ultimately translates to one core tenet: a belief that the United States government has failed and that the country’s divisions, inflamed by the news media, will result in a violent internal war.

“This is a very violent movement even if they are wearing Hawaiian shirts and using funny memes to try to soften what they are doing,” said Kathleen Belew, a history professor and the author of “Bring the War Home: The White Power Movement and Paramilitary America.”

Sergeant Carrillo’s case follows the arrests last month in Las Vegas of an active-duty member of the Army and two veterans, who were charged with trying to provoke violence between the police and protesters at Black Lives Matter marches. Those men were also found to have ties to the movement.

There have been other arrests of boogaloo adherents in recent months in Colorado, Texas and Ohio, each involving plots to ambush law enforcement. In addition, followers of the movement have backed the conservative effort to reopen the Texas economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. Armed men have showed up outside some businesses to support them as they reopened in defiance of the lockdown.

The movement attracts both far-right white supremacists and some armed men who joined the Black Lives Matter protests because of their anger at the police and other symbols of government authority. The 1992 siege by federal law enforcement agents over firearms charges at Ruby Ridge in Idaho, which left two people dead, has long been a rallying cry.

Members often express admiration for training and other benefits that come with being a military veteran. Having a small number of dedicated activists corresponds to an increasing emphasis on violent activity, Ms. Belew said. “They do not want 1,000 people down in the street,” she said. “They are interested in six people who can make and detonate a bomb.”

Sergeant Carrillo was on active duty at Travis Air Force Base in Central California when the Oakland shooting occurred, according to the complaint. He had recruited Mr. Justus online.

In the scenario described by the complaint, the two men, using the distraction provided by protests in downtown Oakland, parked a Ford van directly across from the federal courthouse there. After scoping out the area, Mr. Justus drove the van toward the courthouse and Sergeant Carrillo fired multiple rounds at the guard post, killing Mr. Underwood and wounding his partner, the complaint said.

That sparked an eight-day manhunt that culminated in a shootout near Sergeant Carrillo’s residence in Ben Lomond, Calif., after a witness reported an abandoned van that appeared to contain ammunition, firearms and bomb-making equipment.

Sergeant Carillo, who grew up in the pine-covered mountains of Ben Lomond, north of Santa Cruz, had joined the Air Force in 2009, according to military records.

Deputies from the Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office responded to the report and arrived at the residence where Sergeant Carrillo is accused of opening fire on the deputies, killing Sgt. Damon Gutzwiller.

His lawyer in the state case, Jeffrey C. Stotter, said he had not yet been retained on the federal case but expected to be involved since both were possibly capital cases.

After Sergeant Carrillo shot Mr. Gutzwiller, according to the complaint, he fled on foot and carjacked the Toyota Camry. It was on that vehicle that he scrawled phrases in blood linked to the movement, including “I became unreasonable” and “Stop the duopoly.”

The first quote is attributed to Marvin Heemeyer, who bulldozed 13 buildings in Colorado in 2004 over a zoning dispute. Mr. Heemeyer killed himself but became a hero among antigovernment extremists who call him “Killdozer” in chat rooms.

“Stop the duopoly,” a nonviolent political phrase, refers to criticism that the Democratic and Republican Parties do not allow any room for others, such as libertarians.

Sergeant Carrillo also had a patch on his bulletproof vest of the movement’s flag, with an igloo replacing the stars plus black-and-white stripes, with one stripe a Hawaiian motif.

The F.B.I. searched Sergeant Carrillo’s Facebook accounts, where he had communicated with Mr. Justus and also expressed his violent intentions, according to the complaint.

“It’s a great opportunity to target the specialty soup bois,” Sergeant Carrillo wrote, according to the complaint. The comment was linked to a video of a crowd attacking two California Highway Patrol vehicles. On chat rooms, “bois” is often used as an alternative spelling for “boys,” and soup is shorthand for alphabet soup, which is how adherents refer collectively to federal law enforcement agencies with their many acronyms.

‘A Uniquely American Moment’ in California,"Good morning.

(Don’t already get California Today delivered to your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.)

Most of the curfews around California have been lifted. The National Guard started to leave Los Angeles and Sacramento over the weekend.

But still, thousands of demonstrators poured into the streets in their cars and on horseback. They marched onto the Golden Gate Bridge and set up outside city halls and in parks, calling to fight racism against black Americans, to hold law enforcement officers who kill people accountable, and to defund police departments.

On Sunday afternoon, some 20,000 people — estimated to be the largest protest over the death of George Floyd in the Los Angeles area so far — poured into the streets lined by the Hollywood Walk of Fame for a widely promoted march organized by Black Lives Matter Los Angeles and BLD PWR, along with the rapper YG.

Though protesters’ message was urgent, the vibe was more like a street festival for a diverse spectrum of Angelenos. N.W.A. and Nipsey Hussle blared and people sang along.

While social distancing wasn’t possible, nearly everyone wore face coverings and demonstrators passed out water bottles and hand sanitizer.

The only police presence I saw was in the air — helicopters circled overhead.

[Get the latest on protests around the country.]

Late last week, I talked with Marqueece Harris-Dawson, a City Council member who represents South Los Angeles and has been vocal about issues of race and equity, about what might come next.

Here’s our conversation, lightly edited and condensed:

Tell me about what your days have been like this past week. And how are you feeling about everything?

Every day since Thursday I’ve been spending time walking with protesters, talking with protesters, talking to police officers in the street, talking with businesses.

The rest of my day, I’ve been working with other elected officials, both at the city and state and the county and even national level.

I’ve never felt such strong currents of pain, despair, anger and hope all in the same space at the same time.

[Read more about how protests that started with an image of police violence have been providing more.]

What have you been thinking about what you’ve seen at the protests from demonstrators and in terms of the law enforcement response?

I think the protests are amazing. I never dreamed I would walk up to crowds full of white people, nonblack people screaming, “Black lives matter.”

It’s a uniquely American moment. For the generation of people for whom this is their first big social moment, this is Boston Tea Party-level. This is the Stonewall Riot-level.

The world’s not going to be the same after this. And it’s great to see people coming to their power to take the mantle.

[Read The Vallejo Times-Herald’s reporting on the Vallejo police officer who shot and killed Sean Monterrosa, a San Francisco man, last week in the midst of protests.]

The police response — it’s been, in Los Angeles, I think, mostly good. There were things that could have been better.

Normally, you have a protest one day and then it gets bigger the second day and maybe it peaks on the third day and then it starts to dissipate. Since Thursday of last week, these marches haven’t gotten smaller, they’ve gotten bigger. So I think the L.A.P.D. has been stretched and challenged, and I definitely think they’ll grow from this.

[Read about Gov. Gavin Newsom’s call to create standards for crowd control, from The San Francisco Chronicle.]

What did you think about the mayor’s announcement that his administration would seek to cut $100 million to $150 million from the Police Department’s budget and look for ways to spend it on other community programs?

It was a good first step. It indicates to the people of Los Angeles that he heard us and that he feels the pain and he feels the frustration.

What other kinds of things will you support?

One, we have to substantially reduce the role and our reliance on police officers to do a variety of tasks. Then we’ve got to reduce the proportion of the budget that is taken up by the Police Department.

There are so many other public safety strategies that you can’t ever pursue, because every time there’s an extra nickel, we give three or four cents of it to the Police Department.

[Read more about the debate nationwide over defunding police departments and “reimagining” public safety.]

And that’s really a longer term struggle.

As an example, during the pandemic and in the lockdown, I heard about armed police officers escorting homeless people into buses to go to shelters. The reason we have police officers doing that is because we don’t have anybody else.

If all you’ve got in your toolbox is a hammer, you tend to think everything is a nail. And that disables society as a whole and ends up with death and injury, for particularly African-American young men, but also people of color in general.

How were you seeing South L.A. through all this, where protests were very deliberately peaceful and there wasn’t any of the vandalism or looting other places have seen?

I think people didn’t come to South L.A. because the investment class hasn’t come to South L.A. in a real way. So their stuff wasn’t here. And so I think protesters wanted to flip the script on what they were taught in history books.

[Track coronavirus cases in California.]

Tell me about how you’re thinking about investment in South L.A., particularly in light of the pandemic and the economic downturn.

The impacts have not hit yet, outside of the immediate employment numbers.

That takes a while to hit the streets. Every investment that was about to happen or was on the books in South L.A. before is still on the books and no one’s reporting, we can’t do it now. Now, two months from now, that could be different. We just kind of have to wait and see.

For a lot of people, investment is inevitably tied to gentrification and displacement. Do you see that dynamic changing, now that we’re not in a boom?

The scenarios are very divergent. There’s one scenario that says, it takes pressure off the housing market and so, it’ll become less of an issue for a short amount of time.

Another scenario that says it has the exact opposite effect. People see investment opportunities. The famous investment saying that goes, “Buy when there’s blood in the streets.”

And those scenarios produce such divergent outcomes that it’s hard to prepare for either.

What would you say to nonblack Angelenos who are, like you said, coming into their political power, who want to make their actions and their voices more sustainable in a longer term way?

One thing I would say, they need to stay in the streets.

The budget proposal, I’m telling you, just two weeks ago, you would have been laughed out of the building, if you even suggested half of that as a cut. That’s only happening because they’re there. And what I want them to understand is that more is possible, but you’ve got to keep the pressure on.

You cannot let up and let the forces of the status quo reassume their position.

What to Watch For at Trump’s Tulsa Campaign Rally,"President Trump is scheduled to attend two events in Tulsa, Okla., on Saturday: at 7 p.m. Eastern time, he will deliver brief remarks at what the White House called a “Great American Comeback Celebration” event, and then he will attend a rally inside the BOK Center scheduled for 8 p.m.

This is Mr. Trump’s first rally since March 2. Joining him will be Vice President Mike Pence, Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma and almost a dozen House members, among others.

Tulsa health officials have expressed concerns about conducting the rally in a large, indoor arena while coronavirus cases in Oklahoma are on the rise. The city’s top health official recommended postponing the rally.

The rally was originally scheduled for Friday, June 19, the Juneteenth holiday. Mr. Trump moved it a day after public pressure and quiet lobbying from some West Wing officials and outside allies.

Times reporters are in Tulsa and will provide coverage of the rally and events in the city at nytimes.com.

TULSA, Okla. — President Trump is determined to try to have a political comeback rally in spite of the devastating health and economic crises that have unfolded on his watch, as well as the nationwide protests against racism that have left him on the defensive.

But he is walking on the edge in several ways.

He hopes to pack the 19,000-seat BOK Center and show that America is reopening, but he doesn’t want to bear responsibility for creating a “super spreader” event that sickens his most die-hard supporters. (See: waivers the campaign is requiring from attendees so it can’t be blamed if people catch the coronavirus.)

The health guidance for rallygoers reflects those contradictory ambitions. Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, said he would distribute masks outside the arena and wear one himself, but wouldn’t require people to wear them inside. Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, said Friday she did not plan to cover her face.

Then there is the timing: Mr. Trump will arrive in Tulsa a day after Juneteenth, and at a time when many Americans are grappling with the country’s racist history. His campaign is trying to spin the visit as an effort to shed light on African-American history, rather than to be insensitive to it.

The Trump campaign does not plan to enforce any mask wearing or social distancing policies inside the arena. That means it will be up to people heading inside a crowded arena to care for themselves.

The line outside the arena may be the first tell of how the night will unfold.

Will it look like the line at a Whole Foods in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, where people give each other a generous six-foot berth? Or like the packed beaches in Miami on the first weekend after reopening?

The president has suggested that wearing a mask is an anti-Trump political statement. Do his supporters try to prove their allegiance by risking their health?

Mr. Trump thrust this rally into the nationwide conversation about racism when he originally scheduled it for the Juneteenth holiday that commemorates the end of slavery.

But Mr. Trump rarely talks about injustice or violence against black Americans. He prefers to use wild hyperbole like how he has “done more for the black community than any president since Abraham Lincoln.” He also has a penchant for using racist language, such as his remark last month that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.”

So: What does the president say about race on the day after Juneteenth, in a city that had one of the worst episodes of racial violence in the nation’s history?

Many Oklahoma officials now acknowledge that racist past in Tulsa, where a white mob massacred black people in 1921 and destroyed a prosperous black neighborhood. That openness has helped support racial reconciliation.

But Mr. Trump and his allies rarely show that kind of openness. On Friday, Mr. Pence refused to use the words “black lives matter” in an interview with a Pennsylvania news station, saying instead that “all lives matter” — a phrase that dilutes the specific violence suffered by black Americans for centuries.

How Mr. Trump decides to talk about race will be one of the biggest takeaways of the night.

Prominent black Tulsans, religious leaders and civil rights activists called on Saturday for the city’s mayor, G.T. Bynum, to cancel the president's rally because of health concerns. They also said the city’s black community may bear the brunt of a coronavirus surge, if the rally helps increase infections in the area.

Greg Robinson II, a progressive activist who is running for mayor, implored black citizens to protest away from the rally. “We know that the answer is bringing political officials and policymakers to the table,” he said. 

Pastor Robert Turner of the historic Vernon A.M.E. church on Greenwood Avenue, said he knew the chances that the mayor canceled the rally were slim. He said the leaders sought to pressure Mr. Bynum to “stand up the president.”

Their comments came as thousands of Trump supporters were lined up to enter the rally arena, many of them not wearing masks or socially distancing. In Washington, President Trump departed the White House for Oklahoma midafternoon showing no concerns about the health fears. 

“The event in Oklahoma is unbelievable. The crowds are unbelievable,” he said. “We’ll give a hopefully good speech, see a lot of great people, a lot of great friends.”

Cooped up for three months, Mr. Trump has been acting at times like a caged animal, lashing out at reporters and making unsubstantiated claims on Twitter — suggesting at one point that an older protester who was injured by a police officer in Buffalo was an antifa provocateur who staged the assault.

His poll numbers, in turn, have suffered and now show him trailing former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. both nationally and in critical battleground states. Republican allies have been desperate for Mr. Trump to regain the familiar rally stage, where he first established himself as a political star and where he has become accustomed to letting off steam.

But for years now, Mr. Trump’s rallies have not shocked and awed the way they once did. Has the three-month break from the rally circuit created a pent-up demand among Mr. Trump’s supporters, and breathed life back into Mr. Trump’s campaign, or has the “MAGA” rally lost its luster?

Will there be clashes between Trump supporters and protesters — and if so, how heated do those clashes get?

On Friday, there were signs of tension. As black Tulsans gathered to celebrate Juneteenth, one man at an encampment of Trump supporters about a mile away wore a shirt with a racist message claiming that blacks were slave owners, too. Several also applauded Mr. Trump’s veiled threat to protesters of his rally.

Meanwhile, in a building overlooking the road where rallygoers had set up, signs hanging in the windows spelled out an obscenity directed at Mr. Trump, as well as messages like, “Covid is real. And so is systemic racism.” By Friday evening, several people in an entertainment district in Tulsa were boarding up stores ahead of possible unrest.

Mr. Trump has been downplaying the risk of attending his rally, even as the number of infections in Tulsa and across the country continues to rise and some companies are already beginning to shut down again.

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Trump claimed that Covid-19 testing was overrated and suggested that Americans were wearing masks not for their own protection, but to demonstrate that they do not support him. Will he downplay health concerns on the political stage as the pandemic rages on?"
How Reparations for Slavery Became a 2020 Campaign Issue,"When Shaniyat Chowdhury, a Democratic candidate for Congress in New York, was asked about the most urgent concern facing his district, his options were not in short supply. He could have said housing or hunger. Healthcare was certainly on the table. But when prompted in a local news interview to name what he intends to do about his “single most pressing issue,” the 28-year-old democratic socialist had this answer: reparations, to address centuries of racial injustice.

Mr. Chowdhury was raised in public housing in South Jamaica, Queens. His father waited tables and his mother cleaned hotel rooms. His parents immigrated from Bangladesh, but growing up he noticed that many neighbors who lived like him, in poverty, were black.

He remembers the fifth grade teacher who taught him about slavery, the “original sin” of the country his own family came to seeking economic opportunity. Two decades later, he is running for Congress to reckon with that history.

“It’s about more than a check,” he said in a recent interview. “It’s about improving the quality of life for black Americans. It’s about addressing the sins of this nation over 400 years.”

transcript

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

Today: It began with a government promise 155 years ago that in some ways has yet to be fulfilled. Professor Daina Ramey Berry on the history of Juneteenth, and what it means in this moment. It’s Friday, June 19.

Dr. Berry, take us back to June 19, 1865, and what happened that day.

For most enslaved people in Texas, it was a typical day. They got up, they went to the fields, were picking cotton or producing sugar, and working just as they always had done. This was two months after the Civil War ended and two-and-a-half years after the Emancipation Proclamation that President Lincoln issued on January 1 of 1863. Although they were fighting for their freedom, although they were still running away and committing acts of day-to-day resistance on plantations, enslaved people were not actually living in freedom.

But on that day, June 19 of 1865, General Gordon Granger of the Union Army galloped into Galveston with 2000 other individuals and came and gave a proclamation. “The people of Texas,” Granger said, “are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the executive of the United States, slaves are free.

This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor.”

Formerly enslaved people, when they heard the news that slavery was over in Texas, celebrated. It was a day of great jubilee.

They danced, they sung, they fled their plantations.

It was them claiming their freedom. It was them going out and embracing it. It was them packing their bags and leaving. It was them hugging their loved ones and saying, we’re free. We’re finally free.

In the 1930s, the Works Progress Administration interviewed formerly enslaved people and asked them to tell their stories of slavery. Many recalled June 19, particularly those that had been enslaved in Texas. We learned decades later of their experience and their response to when they learned about freedom.

Sarah Ford said, “When freedom come, I didn’t know what that was.” Her uncle came to the yard and yelled, “Everybody free, everybody free. And pretty soon soldiers comes and the captain reads the proclamation.”

Others like Molly Farrell, a Texas bond woman, said, “Everybody talk about freedom and hope to get free before they die. Me and my mother left right off. Most everybody else goes with us. We walked down the road, singing and shouting to a beat of the band. My father comes the next day and joins us.”

Sarah Ashley recalled, “I was 19 years old when the burst of freedom come in June and I get turned loose.” Her former enslaver said that they were welcome to stay, except her father felt like they wanted to leave, Sarah recalls. “Papa left, but he came back with a wagon and mules. When he borrows and he loads up mama and my sister and me, and us goes to East Columbia on the Brazos River, and we settled down. They hired out my time, gave us a patch of land, and for the first time, I ever seen money. Papa builds us a cabin and a corn crib, and I was so happy, because the bright light done come and there was no more whippins.”

Within a year when formerly enslaved people are celebrating Juneteenth, they’re also facing grave restrictions upon their lives because of the 1866 Black Codes, which restricted African-Americans from doing everyday activities — restricted them from where they could go. They actually predated Jim Crow legislation. This was also the same year that the Ku Klux Klan was founded in Pulaski, Tennessee.

But African-Americans that were formerly enslaved in Texas celebrated on. They celebrated Juneteenth in their backyards, in their churches, in their communities. They had barbecues and picnics and celebrated and remembered. They remembered the institution of slavery. Elders came and talked to the young children and told them about their experiences with slavery, and wanted them to recognize the importance and the significance of emancipation. Because of the Great Migration, African-Americans that lived in Texas moved to other parts of the United States, and they brought the celebration of Juneteenth, Emancipation Day, with them.

But then, in the 1920s, ‘30s and ‘40s, because of Jim Crow laws, African-Americans celebrated Juneteenth in private settings, in their homes and in their churches. They were restricted in terms of parks and public spaces. They could not go to movie theaters except for on certain days, and they had to enter through certain doors. They were restricted from amusement parks, water fountains, lunch counters. All forms of segregation forced African-Americans into their own communities. And in these spaces, during the heart of Jim Crow segregation, African-Americans celebrated Juneteenth privately.

Uh! Your bad self! Say it louder! I’m black and I’m proud!

The resurgence of the public version of Juneteenth returns in the 1960s with the civil rights movement and the Black Power movement.

[CHANTING] Black is beautiful.

The Black Power movement disseminated ideas about black is beautiful.

[CHANTING] Set our water free. Frey Huey! Set our water —

Black people embraced the way they looked.

The reason for it, you might say, is like a new awareness among black people that their own natural appearance, physical appearance, is beautiful.

Their hair, their clothing.

Isn’t it beautiful? All right.

— an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my poor little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. I have a dream today.

At this time, African-Americans were celebrating victories from the civil rights movement.

Now, in this summer of 1964, the Civil Rights Bill is the law of the land. In the words of the president, it restricts no one’s freedom, so long as he respects the rights of others.

And they then started becoming more and more public about their celebrations with Juneteenth festivals.

Residents of Resurrection City, and my fellow citizens —

One particular celebration occurred on June 19 of 1968.

— I stand here today with many mixed emotions.

The D.C. Urban League invited Coretta Scott King to speak on that day.

For it was five years ago that my late husband, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., stood in this very spot and told the nation about his dream.

A mourning wife, a grieving mother is talking to a crowd of 75,000 people about African-American freedom and the freedom of all people.

Perhaps racism can be traced to that dark period in our history when slavery became institutionalized for 244 years.

The roots of racism, she reminded us, deprived African-Americans and other poor people of color dignity, self-respect, jobs, and they often experienced violence by the hands of white Americans.

The road to justice, peace and brotherhood is difficult. We must renew our strength, increase our faith and gird our courage.

People left this particular celebration and brought it back to their homes in their states throughout the country.

And in this moment, African-Americans are embracing and celebrating Juneteenth. They’re celebrating it because they’re taking pride in their culture, they’re remembering a difficult part of their history — the history of slavery — and they’re recognizing freedom and equality.

Juneteenth becomes a state holiday in Texas officially in 1980. And from this moment on, celebrations from Juneteenth become much more public, large scale parades, barbecues, picnics. African-Americans are celebrating and sharing the stories of slavery, sharing the history of slavery and sharing oral histories from those that remember celebrations from years ago.

Another widely publicized incident captured on videotape has become a focus for ethnic tensions between the black and Korean communities in Los Angeles.

Then there came a moment in the early 1990s where Juneteenth celebrations took on new meanings.

March 16, 1991. Latasha Harlins, a black teenager, is shot and killed by a Korean store owner, Soon Ja Du.

Du claimed Harlins was stealing a bottle of orange juice when she confronted the teenager.

The merchant, Soon Ja Du, was convicted of voluntary manslaughter. Her sentence: five years probation. No jail time.

The black community is outraged.

And it sends a bad message that a human life is not valued.

What, six months probation? I mean, the people were pissed then.

The title of this videotape is very appropriate. It’s called “The Foothill Incident.” And by now, like every man, woman and child in probably the United States, you have witnessed this videotape in your own living rooms over and over again.

A bystander videotaped the policeman shocking 25-year-old Rodney King with a stun gun, then clubbing and kicking him as he lay on the ground.

Against a growing national furor over last weekend’s police beating of an unarmed black motorist, Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates said today that all 14 officers involved will be disciplined, and that three will face criminal charges.

These two incidents sparked unrest in the community. But after the King beating, African-Americans were once again on alert.

35 days of testimony, 54 witnesses, the video played scores of times in real time, slow motion, frame by frame. Finally, the jurors leave to deliberate.

Well, my reaction is shock first and then disappointment. Obviously, we feel the evidence warranted a conviction on the defendants, and the jury disagreed with us. And we must abide by their decision.

All the police officers involved in the beating of Rodney King were acquitted, and that led to the Los Angeles riots.



The violence erupted after the acquittal of four white policemen in the beating trial of black motorist Rodney King.

We’re being told that several patrol cars have been surrounded near Parker Center downtown. All of the officers in the Central Division are being instructed to put on their helmets with shields in the area near the police headquarters.

[CHANTING]

I feel that there is an undercurrent of racism and that the system is rotten to the core.

No justice, no peace!

We’re looking at you. We can tell you now at least five major fires have broken out in South Central.

There were so many blazes the fire department couldn’t respond to all the calls and just let some buildings burn to the ground.

Yes, they saw law abiding citizens expressing their anger at the verdict. And they chose as an opportunity to steal, to loot, to vandalize and indeed, to kill. That we cannot and will not tolerate.



As in 1968, after the Rodney King beating, there was a resurgence in the celebration of Juneteenth, because African-Americans were thinking about freedoms and thinking about civil rights and thinking about Rodney King. They wanted to celebrate and focus on African-American liberty, African-American justice, and they felt like Rodney King did not receive justice. So Juneteenth celebrations were celebrations to recognize freedom and recognize enslavement at the same time.

So the story of Juneteenth, from what you’re saying, is cyclical. It’s the story of cycles of joy and pain living side by side. And the last time that Juneteenth experienced a major resurgence began with this scene of police brutality and systemic racism broadcast to the entire country.

Absolutely. We saw this the very first year Juneteenth was celebrated in the 1860s against the backdrop of both joy and pain, of slavery and freedom. We saw this in the 1960s. We saw this again in the 1990s. And we’re seeing this again today.



We’ll be right back.

So Dr. Berry, here we are. It’s about 30 years after Rodney King. And we are in the middle of another national outcry over police violence and systemic racism. And it is now June 19, 2020 — Juneteenth. And I know that this may be a bit of an unfair question to ask a historian without the benefit of time and of distance, but what does this day mean right now in this moment?

For me, as a historian, it means celebrating African-American freedom and African-American restraints that are put upon us as a people. It is a moment where we celebrate gains and losses.

We’re seeing African-Americans today being beaten the same way we did in the 1990s, the same way we did in the ‘60s, and in the 1860s. We’re seeing African-American life being devaluated by not only police officers, but also citizens who feel like they have the right to challenge and confront African-Americans for doing everyday, mundane tasks. Black people are being killed in their living rooms. They’re being killed in their backyards. They’re being killed on the streets. And they’re being killed sleeping in their cars. They’re being killed for going and purchasing some Skittles or playing with a toy gun in a park.

I have these conversations, and these conversations means so much to me, as a mother who has an African-American teenage young man in my household.

And so what has that conversation been like with your son?

Very difficult conversations with him. The fear of the police and what to do if he’s confronted. We had that conversation with him when he was 12. And it’s been hard because we have very close friends that are police officers. So it’s a very mixed conversation, you know, to have with him. And to talk to him about how to interact, how to carry himself, how to speak, when to speak, what to do with his hands. All of these sort of prescriptive things that we talk to him about, so that he knows what to do, and that he can make smart decisions when being confronted by police officers.

And he worries that his life expectancy is short. And he said that to me when he was eight. And he’s talked about it recently, and he said, you know, am I going to live to 30?

And what did you say back?

What did I say back. I said, that’s a reality that is hard. And as a mother, it’s hard to have this conversation. But yes, you can live till you’re more than 30.

But that the reality is, no matter what he does, some people will still look at him as a threat to society. He remembers when he was “cute.” He was still cute at seven. But once he became eight or nine, people started grabbing their purses on elevators when we got on elevators.

Just two weeks ago in our own neighborhood, when we were walking our dog, he was behind me, and some of our neighbors followed him because he had a mask on. And he said, well mom, how do I protect myself from disease when people are looking at me as a criminal? And I said, carefully, gingerly. And do the best you can at being who you are, being proud of who you are, but also being careful that not everybody see you as the beautiful child that I gave birth to and that my husband and I have raised.



So in this cycle of joy and pain that has always been Juneteenth, which way does it lean for you and for your family this year? Joy or pain?

Pain. Absolutely pain. We’re hurt by the ways in which African-Americans are being hurt in this country. We’re hurt that all of the battles of freedom and for equality. We’re hurt that no matter what we do, we’re still being treated with a level of disrespect that hearkens back to earlier periods in American history.

I teach an African-American history class called Intro to African-American History. And it covers African arrival in what became the United States until today. It’s a big, sweeping time period. But students often are exhausted by the time we reach the 20th century, because of the highs and lows that African-Americans have experienced in this country.

I remember one student asking me, where is the black joy? When do we get to see black joy? And I said we’re coming up to the Harlem Renaissance. There’s lots of joy in that decade. But then it follows by the Great Depression and the Jim Crow legislation and lynching. And so once we have a high, then it ebbs down into a low valley of despair and pain. And students are saying again, Dr. Berry, we’re getting exhausted. We’re going back into this period of despair. And then there’s a resurgence of the civil rights movement and the Black Power movement, and we have another sort of swing upward.

But as a historian, I wonder, in this moment — it’s hard to interpret historical moments when we’re in them — but I wonder what we’ll say about today 50 years from now. Will we say that there was a change, or is this another high or another low that we’ve experienced, and we go back to business as usual? I like to think, because I’m an optimist, that there will be change and that we will come out of this low moment as a better people and a better society.



When you think about Juneteenth as the day that finally brought freedom to enslaved people in Texas, how do you think about freedom in this moment?

For me, when I think about Juneteenth as Emancipation Day, and I think about this moment, I feel like we still need to be emancipated. There are still more freedoms that need to be protected. There’s still more laws that need to be revised. There’s still more inclusion that needs to happen. There’s still more achievement to be had. There’s still more space for change and growth.

And so for me, on today, on Juneteenth, I’m reflecting on how can I, in my little corner of the world, make change happen and make generations that come after me experience a more just and whole society. And I spend the day reflecting on that, and having conversations with my husband and my son, and trying to encourage him to have hope and faith in the future.



Dr. Berry, thank you very much. We appreciate it.

Thank you for having me on this historic day.



We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today. The Times reports that global daily infection rates from the coronavirus reached record highs over the past week, driven by outbreaks in Latin America, Africa, South Asia and the United States. In Brazil, officials reported more than 32,000 new cases on Wednesday, the most in the world. The U.S. reported the second most, more than 25,000. Within the U.S., California and Florida reported their highest daily infections yet on Thursday, prompting California to require the state’s 40 million residents to cover their faces in almost all settings outside the home. And —

I’ve sent a letter to the clerk of the House, directing the clerk to remove the portraits of four previous speakers of the House who served in the Confederacy.

In Washington, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she would take down the portraits of four previous House speakers who had served in the Confederacy. One of them, James Orr of South Carolina, had vowed on the floor of the House to quote, “preserve and perpetuate slavery.”

There’s no room in the hallowed halls of this democracy, this temple of democracy, to memorialize people who embody violent bigotry and grotesque racism of the Confederacy.

For some scholars who have studied reparations for decades, that’s a remarkable sentiment to hear from a congressional candidate, even one running in a deep-blue Queens district.

Representative John Conyers, who died in 2019, was a long-serving Democrat from Michigan and a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus. He introduced a bill on the study of reparations every year beginning in 1989 and said he would “do so until it’s passed into law.” (He did, until he resigned in 2017.) For years, the prospect of the bill becoming law seemed quite distant. Gallup polling has shown that more than two-thirds of Americans oppose reparations. President Barack Obama said in 2016 that he considered the idea impractical.

Slowly, though, the notion has gained political traction. Sheila Jackson Lee, the Democratic congresswoman from Texas, reintroduced Mr. Conyers’s bill that would establish a commission to study the impact of slavery and make recommendations for its “apology and compensation” in 2019, and Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, introduced companion legislation in the Senate. Last year on Juneteenth, an annual holiday commemorating the ending of slavery, a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee held a first-of-its-kind hearing on reparations.

“This is a nation that has gone through slavery, Reconstruction, lynching, Jim Crowism,” Ms. Jackson Lee said Thursday. “We’re in a new era. We have the hearts and minds of the American people. That’s why I think reparations will pass.”

But few political candidates have featured the issue front and center in their campaigns. “It was somewhat of a verboten topic for political figures in the past,” said William Darity, a public policy professor at Duke University and author of “From Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the Twenty-First Century.” “There’s been a real fear that there could be a political penalty from the white electorate from any intimation that you might seriously consider it.”

In the past year, that attitude appears to have shifted: “It’s striking to me that people campaigning to be elected officials are mentioning the word at all,” Mr. Darity said. “There seems to be a sea change.”

Candidates around the country have found the idea of reparations to be a powerful way of engaging young progressive voters. Charles Booker, the state legislator running in the Democratic primary to challenge Mitch McConnell for Senate in Kentucky, mentions reparations on his campaign website, noting his own family’s history of lynching and enslavement. Jamaal Bowman, running in the Democratic primary against congressman Eliot Engel in New York, has said that he believes in reparations, citing author Ta-Nehisi Coates’s testimony at last year’s congressional hearing.

While the political push has long come from veteran black lawmakers, white candidates are discussing the issue of reparations too. At a recent Senate primary debate between Senator Ed Markey and Representative Joe Kennedy, both the Massachusetts Democrats said they were open to the idea. Mr. Kennedy said in an interview that the conversation should “go beyond debate over a study” of the issue, where the legislative focus has remained for decades.

Andrew Romanoff, a Democratic candidate for Senate in Colorado, announced that he supports reparations for both Native and black Americans during a recent primary debate. Mr. Romanoff started his career working at the Southern Poverty Law Center, and later led an undercover investigation on employment discrimination for a state civil rights agency. He has made racial justice a central part of his policy platform.

“Like other big ideas, reparations is one arriving more swiftly to the realm of the possible,” he said. “For a long time it was stuck in a debate over the mechanics and the money. How much would it cost? The first step is to recognize the moral obligation.”

The mechanics are no doubt fiercely debated; reparations has been used to describe a variety of proposals, though at its heart refers to financial compensation from the government to the descendants of enslaved people. Mr. Romanoff, and many others, looks to the precedent set by Germany in paying reparations to victims of the Holocaust when arguing for the plausibility of a similar effort in the United States.

Mr. Romanoff said he has heard voters describe reparations as “too extreme” or “too far left.” But he views its polling popularity as “beside the point” and said he sees his campaign as an opportunity to educate voters about the feasibility of ideas that may seem politically unpalatable.

“If you agree it’s the right thing to do, then the fact that it may not poll well isn’t a concern,” Mr. Romanoff said. “Consensus doesn’t magically materialize, it has to be forged.”

Some polls indicate that current conditions may be ripe for forging consensus on issues that long seemed beyond the sphere of political possibility. In the two weeks after the killing of George Floyd, public support for the Black Lives Matter movement increased almost as much as it had in the preceding two years. The idea of defunding or abolishing the police, which was for years relegated primarily to the realm of a hashtag, has inched closer to reality in Minneapolis, where a veto-proof majority of the City Council has pledged to disband its police department.

And the country has now seen both a public health crisis and an economic crisis that disproportionately hurt black Americans. “Whenever we have an economic shock, you see black people have a harder time recovering because of historical discrimination connected to the wealth gap,” said Andre Perry, a Brookings Institution fellow and a co-author of a recent report on reparations. “Now you see how easily we found money to give out when white people were suffering because of Covid and you scratch your head.”

Practicality is not the only impediment mentioned. A nationwide poll conducted last year found that while a majority of black Americans favor reparations, they think of the proposal as less helpful than other progressive policies such as a higher minimum wage and stronger anti-discrimination laws.

The country’s first systematic attempt to offer a form of reparations for slavery came when Union General William T. Sherman issued an order, in 1865, promising 40 acres of land, and later a mule, to former slaves. The idea originated in a conversation the general and War Secretary Edwin Stanton held with 20 leaders of the black community in Savannah, Ga. But Andrew Johnson, President Lincoln’s successor, overturned the order months later. (The name of the house reparations bill, H.R. 40, is a reference to those promised 40 acres.)

“With 40 acres and a mule, what slaves were asking for was the ability to become functioning members of society, by working,” said Royce West, a Texas state senator who is running in a Democratic primary for U.S. Senate. At a recent debate he said he leans in favor of reparations; his opponent, M.J. Hegar, did not go that far, saying she would want to study the issue further. “That particular promise was never kept by government because the politics did away with it,” he added.

More than a century and a half later, Mr. West is hopeful that the politics constraining that unfulfilled promise have changed. “Right now you have corporate America throwing money at the problem,” he said, referring to the million of dollars poured into racial justice organizations in recent weeks. “The question is how will that money be spent.”

It’s not just corporations — hundreds of thousands of Americans have taken to the streets marching for racial justice in recent weeks. Amid the unrest, some candidates have found the idea of reparations to be a powerful way of engaging young progressive voters. Mr. Darity said younger Americans also seem to view reparations more favorably than older generations; polling in 2016 showed that nearly 4 out of 5 baby boomers tend to oppose the idea, while more than half of millennials say they are either in favor or unsure.

“Young people across races are very excited about it,” said Mr. Bowman, one of the Democratic congressional candidates in New York who has made reparations part of his pitch.

“Voters have been telling me this is long past due. For a very long time we’ve talked about the study of the need for reparations, but the data is already available,” he added, citing low health, education and economic outcomes for black Americans.

And one more data point: The Black Lives Matter rallies he has attended in predominantly white neighborhoods, and with large, diverse crowds, have made him think that what once seemed to so many as a political impossibility could be closer to reality.

Ask Your Questions About the Pandemic in California,"Good morning.

(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)

Today we’re starting with a call for questions from Marie Tae McDermott:

After California’s nearly 40 million residents were ordered to stay at home to slow the spread of the coronavirus, people were forced to adapt to a new reality. Every aspect of life as we knew it changed drastically.

As the state continues to allow businesses to reopen, cases have been steadily increasing, leaving many residents wrestling with what to do.

The pandemic also underscored the vast disparities that exist in the state. Millions of immigrant families are excluded from federal relief packages. The state’s economy is collapsing, and low-income families have been hit the hardest. California’s unemployment rate is above 20 percent, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom.

The virus’s toll on life in California has been devastating, to say the least.

[See which California counties have rising coronavirus case counts.]

To help us understand the events of the past few months and what the future might look like, we’re reviving our Your Lead series, where we’ll answer your questions about the effects of the pandemic on daily life for millions of Californians.

What do you want to know about how the pandemic is changing life in California?

We want your questions about everything — not just the economy, but also about health care, the environment, dating, traveling, commuting, how our culture is changing and more. We want to look at all the ways we are experiencing life during the pandemic.

Here’s your chance to shape our reporting as we write about life in 2020 and beyond. While we are based in California, we may share some of your questions with our colleagues across the country.

Using this form, tell us what you’re wondering about, what topics you want us to dig into and why you want to know. We’ll answer some of your questions in future newsletters and stories.

In our previous call for questions about inequality in California, you asked and we answered: Where does the state’s homeless population come from? What income counts as middle class? How does homelessness in California compare with other states? We will continue reporting out answers to your questions about inequality.

We look forward to hearing from you.

It’s been a while since we included a remembrance of someone lost in the coronavirus pandemic, but we’re continuing with the series. (If you’d like to share memories of a Californian who has died, please email us at CAtoday@nytimes.com.)

Today’s piece is about Wanda DeSelle and was written by Amy Mostafa:

When talk of retirement came up, Wanda DeSelle, 76, would always laugh it off.

“I’ll retire after you do,” Mrs. DeSelle would tell her boss of 40 years, Dr. Mohammad Ashraf, a cardiologist seven years her junior. “She’d say, ‘If you’ll work for another 20 years, then I’ll work for another 20 years,’” he recalled.

Mrs. DeSelle was the office manager at Dr. Ashraf’s six-person medical practice in Madera, a small city in the Central Valley northwest of Fresno. She worked full time with hardly a day off. Her husband died five years ago and she said she’d be bored at home anyway.

A sign in the reception area read, “Do you want to talk to the boss or the person who really knows something here?” Everyone in the office knew that person was Mrs. DeSelle. “She did everything,” Dr. Ashraf said.

In mid-March, Mrs. DeSelle left work early with a stomachache. Her condition declined rapidly and she went to the hospital, where she tested positive for Covid-19 and was eventually put on a ventilator. She died on April 3.

“Her laugh is the majority of my memories of her,” Brenda Alvarez, a medical assistant who worked with Mrs. DeSelle for two decades, said. “You could just see the sparkle in her eye when she would laugh and you knew that she was just happy.”

Mrs. DeSelle is survived by two children, five grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.

"Protests Spur Surge in Donations, Giving ActBlue Its Biggest Day of the Year","The mass protests that have swept the nation in recent days to express outrage at the death of George Floyd have been paired with a flood of financial donations, as hundreds of thousands of Americans have opened their wallets to give to charitable groups, community bail funds and Democratic candidates.

The Minnesota Freedom Fund, which pays bail for those who cannot afford it and received online support from some celebrities, took in a remarkable $20 million in a matter of days — so much that its website was now encouraging donors to give elsewhere.

A GoFundMe memorial fund established by Mr. Floyd’s brother had raised more than $7 million from more than a quarter-million contributors.

And on ActBlue, the central online hub that processes money for Democratic candidates and causes, Sunday was the single largest day of giving in all of 2020, with donations of $19 million, according to a New York Times analysis of the site’s donation tracker.

Then donors set another record for the year on Monday, topping $20 million shortly after 9 p.m.

The sums given on ActBlue on both Sunday and Monday topped all the presidential primary debate nights and election nights in 2020, and were more than double the amount given on the final day of April (monthly deadlines tend to drive online political giving). The previous high for the year was the day in late February when former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. won the South Carolina Democratic primary and revived his campaign for president; donors contributed $18.3 million that day.

In all, ActBlue processed more than $60 million between Friday and Monday, a sign that the energy spilling into the streets nationwide might also be matched by a wave of money for Democratic causes. (The closest Republican equivalent of ActBlue, called WinRed, does not have a public donation ticker.)

ActBlue does not disclose in real time how donations to the platform are divided between candidates and causes, but a spokesperson for the site said half of the donations on Sunday went to charitable causes.

One ActBlue page where supporters could split a donation across 37 different bail funds reported more than 20,000 donations worth about $1.5 million as of late Monday morning. Such funds help cover the costs of posting cash bail for those jailed before trials, and are seen as a way to support protesters who have been arrested.

So much money is flowing so fast it is hard to keep track.

On Sunday evening, Senator Bernie Sanders emailed his enormous list of supporters asking them to donate to a different group of charities. The email alone raised $400,000 in its first 12 hours, according to Mike Casca, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders.

One nonprofit in Minneapolis, the Lake Street Council, reported raising $2.25 million as of Monday morning from 27,000 donors. It said it would use the money to help rebuild businesses, “many of which are black- or minority-owned.”

In Illinois, the Chicago Community Bail Fund reported receiving more than $1.6 million from 30,000 people. An effort in Los Angeles, the People’s City Council Freedom Fund, went viral and jumped from $1,500 raised as of early Saturday to more than $860,000 on Monday from more than 21,000 contributors.

“Watching the numbers climb was surreal,” said Sabrina Johnson, an organizer with the Los Angeles group, which was initially raising funds to pay for tickets people received in April protesting the mayor’s response to the coronavirus. Ms. Johnson said the fund was now partnering with a local chapter of Black Lives Matter and the National Lawyers Guild, a progressive group, to distribute the windfall.

The group posted a cautionary note on Twitter after donating went viral. “If you share it,” it wrote of its GoFundMe page, “please let your followers know it’s not just a bail fund!”

For the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which posted a note directing people to other organizations on Saturday, the volume of money was staggering. In the group’s most recent tax form available online, from 2018, it reported receiving $110,000 in donations.

“We have been flooded with tens of thousands donations large and small, totaling around $20 million dollars,” the group said in a note. “We did not ask for or anticipate this massive outpouring of support.”"
"Bernie Sanders Predicted Revolution, Just Not This One","People are in the streets, confronting injustice and demanding fundamental change.

It is the kind of moment that Senator Bernie Sanders spoke about on the 2020 presidential campaign trail, and for decades before that. But when the revolution finally came, it wasn’t his.

The rise of revolutionary sentiment, like many things, is about timing. The coronavirus outbreak had already renewed support for progressive policy proposals, including “Medicare for all.” But the disproportionate impact of the coronavirus on black Americans, combined with the galvanizing death of George Floyd at the hands of the police in Minneapolis, have heightened the call to address systemic racism and police brutality, uniting Democrats — and the country — in a campaign for action in a way that Mr. Sanders’s message of economic equality did not.

“People are sick and tired of police murders of African-Americans,” Mr. Sanders said in an interview. “People are saying enough is enough.”

Mr. Sanders, whose slogan on his campaign was “Not me, us,” described the protests as a validation of his theory of social change: “What I have said for a very long time is that real change is never going to come from the top on down, it’s always from the bottom on up.”

But during his presidential bid, Mr. Sanders at times seemed uncomfortable speaking overtly about race. At a presidential forum in April 2019 for women of color, he offered few specific policy details, and drew some groans from the audience when he referred to marching with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in response to a question about how he would handle current challenges.

And more recently, during an event in Flint, Mich., in March that campaign aides had billed as an opportunity for him to speak directly to black voters, he decided not to deliver a planned speech and instead largely ceded the stage to panelists including the academic Cornel West.

When Mr. Sanders spoke about racial equality, it was often in the context of economic equality, championing proposals and prescriptions that he believed would improve the lives of all working Americans. He said that policies like single-payer health care would address higher maternal and infant mortality rates in black communities. And he wanted to legalize marijuana and end cash bail, policies he said were aimed in particular at helping black Americans and other people of color.

These proposals, however, also amounted to an implicit expectation that voters trust the government — an especially difficult sell for those including older black voters who feel they have been historically let down by the government.

They were shortcomings that help explain why Mr. Sanders lost to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in the Democratic primary race: Unable to win over older black voters, he came in a distant second to Mr. Biden in South Carolina, then went on to lose to Mr. Biden in every Southern state on Super Tuesday. Those defeats, Mr. Sanders’s allies say, contributed to the perception that Mr. Biden was more electable and would fare better against President Trump in the general election in November — a notion that helped propel Mr. Biden to victory in the primary.

Now, some of the same progressive leaders who never quite figured out how to mobilize such a broad coalition in the primary are considering how to not only support the movement, but also harness its energy as they look toward November.

Many Sanders allies maintain that racial justice was and continues to be a central tenet of his ideology. “If you do parse back the things that our campaign was fighting for, those policies, if they were able to come to life, would have certainly changed the positions for African-Americans in this country,” said Nina Turner, a national co-chair of the Sanders campaign and one of his most prominent black surrogates.

Though she praised his agenda regarding black Americans, she conceded that he did not articulate it forcefully enough. “It had that kind of tone to it, but it wasn’t as piercing as this moment demands,” she said.

Yet amid a national movement for racial justice that took hold after high-profile killings of black men and women, there is also an acknowledgment among some progressives that their discussion of racism, including from their standard-bearer, did not seem to meet or anticipate the forcefulness of these protests.

Kimberlé Crenshaw, the legal scholar who pioneered the concept of intersectionality to describe how various forms of discrimination can overlap, said that Mr. Sanders struggled with the reality that talking forcefully about racial injustice has traditionally alienated white voters — especially the working-class white voters he was aiming to win over. But that is where thinking of class as a “colorblind experience” limits white progressives. “Class cannot help you see the specific contours of race disparity,” she said.

Many other institutions, she noted, have now gone further faster than the party that is the political base of most African-American voters. “You basically have a moment where every corporation worth its salt is saying something about structural racism and anti-blackness, and that stuff is even outdistancing what candidates in the Democratic Party were actually saying,” she said.

Already, a split has emerged in the way progressive leaders and protesters approach systemic racism and police reform, raising broader questions about whether elected officials are in sync with what is happening on the ground. While some activists have embraced the protesters’ rallying cry to “defund the police,” many progressive leaders, including Mr. Sanders, are calibrating their approach.

Unlike during the primary season, when he often took the most leftward position, Mr. Sanders has disagreed with protesters’ demands to eliminate funding for police departments, staking out a careful position on police reform.

“Anyone who thinks that we should abolish all police departments in America, I don’t agree,” Mr. Sanders told The New Yorker. In keeping with his stance when he was mayor of Burlington, Vt., he supported paying police officers more.

At the same time, progressive organizations like the Sunrise Movement, a youth-led liberal environmental group that endorsed Mr. Sanders in the primary, have aggressively pushed to defund the police, adopting the policy as one of their own. When Mr. Biden released a statement last week that took a more cautious position on police overhaul, the Sunrise Movement denounced his stance on Twitter. “@JoeBiden you’re hurting any chance you have at defeating Trump by taking these centrist stances,” the group said. “We need someone fighting with us to create bold change, not someone to maintain the status-quo #DefundPolice.”

But while most progressives might not have seen this revolution coming, they are catching up.

Rahna Epting, the executive director of the progressive group MoveOn, said the protests were a time for national groups like hers to listen to the grass roots. “In terms of what we do, we see the people on the streets right now, this is completely organic,” she said. “This is beyond any one organization or institution.”

She added: “We’re recognizing the moment is not ours, it’s the people’s, and we need to flank the people right now.”

The protests are not directly connected to partisan politics, even though there are some similarities between their broad demands and the revolutionary sentiment embodied by Mr. Sanders’s campaign. But if there is overlap, it is not yet clear whether the energy on the ground, particularly among young progressives who supported Mr. Sanders but remain dissatisfied with Mr. Biden, will translate to enthusiasm at the ballot box in November.

Progressives at both the national and grass-roots level are still trying to push Mr. Biden to the left even as he has begun to adopt the language of systemic disruption. His willingness to satisfy their demands — on policing perhaps most urgently but also on issues like climate change and health care — could help determine whether he is successful in the general election.

Despite persistent ideological disagreements, some progressive leaders are optimistic that the mass social movement will become an animating force in the upcoming election, especially for voters on the left who may have been unhappy initially with Mr. Biden. In a Pew Research Center survey released last week, 91 percent of Democrats and those who lean Democratic said they supported the Black Lives Matter movement.

“At some point, many of the people on the street will view this election as a referendum on black lives,” said Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the left-wing Working Families Party and a leader in the Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of rights groups. In addition to elevating the demands of protesters, he said, his group plans to support candidates who are “brave enough to say that this is a time that we take on the police.”

Some progressives point to the demonstrations occurring around the country, in big cities and small towns, as proof that many Americans did support the idea of systemic, revolutionary change, even if it did not succeed as an electoral argument for Mr. Sanders in the primary.

“We see on television wonderful evidence of the kinetic energy of the Democratic Party,” said Faiz Shakir, who served as Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, “that was obviously evident during the Bernie Sanders campaign, too.”

Many political observers are eagerly awaiting the results of the June 23 Democratic primary in New York’s 16th Congressional District, a predominantly black and Hispanic district that includes parts of Westchester and the Bronx, where Jamaal Bowman, a middle school principal and outspoken advocate for racial justice, is running a tight race against the longtime incumbent, Representative Eliot L. Engel. In recent days, Mr. Bowman has received endorsements from several top progressives, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Mr. Sanders.

In an interview, Mr. Bowman was reluctant to speak about his electoral odds. But he said he had received messages from supporters thanking him for speaking out against racism and racial inequality. “What we need now from Democrats and the country is a deep analysis of structural racism,” he said.

It is a sentiment that has taken on new urgency among many progressives, who stress their longstanding support for racial justice but who have also come to realize that they must more directly confront racism and police brutality than they have before.

To support the protest movement, Mr. Sanders has endorsed a slate of progressive candidates who are fighting explicitly for racial justice. Using his email list, he has raised more than $2 million for racial justice organizations, according to a spokesman.

“It’s not good enough to sit back,” Mr. Sanders said.

Although he said he thought there would be “a broadening of discussion about what we mean by justice in America,” he also held firm to his political philosophy.

“If you’re serious about racial justice — if you’re serious about criminal justice,” he said, “you have got to be serious about economic justice.”

Minneapolis to Ban Use of Chokeholds by Police,"

Minneapolis officials on Friday announced an agreement to immediately ban the use of chokeholds and strangleholds, in a move meant to bolster accountability within a Police Department that uses force against African-Americans far more often than against white residents.

Officials also announced a duty for officers to intervene and report any use of unauthorized force, according to an agreement between city and state officials.

The agreement comes after nearly two weeks of protests over the death of George Floyd, a black man who was pinned under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer for nearly nine minutes, including after Mr. Floyd fell unresponsive. The officer faces a charge of murder, and three other officers on the scene were charged with aiding and abetting the killing.

“George Floyd’s service yesterday underscored that justice for George requires more than accountability for the man who killed him — it requires accountability from elected leadership to deep, structural reforms,” Mayor Jacob Frey said in a statement.

The manual of the Minneapolis Police Department previously stated that neck restraints and chokeholds were basically reserved for life-or-death situations for officers, a threat that was not apparent during Mr. Floyd’s detention.

Under the agreement with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights, the Minneapolis Police Department must also comply with a civil rights investigation and can only use force to control protest crowds with the approval of the chief of police. After approval by a county judge, the terms of the agreement will be enforceable by the court.

The Minneapolis ban came as use-of-force policies are being re-examined across the country. This week, Colorado introduced legislation to ban the use of chokeholds by law enforcement, and on Friday, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California called for the removal of neck restraints from the state’s police training programs, saying that such tactics have “no place any longer in 21st-century policing and practices.”

The Los Angeles Police Department banned the use of neck restraints in 1982 after 16 deaths in police custody in seven years were attributed to chokeholds. Illinois, Colorado and California have also passed laws restricting the use of the tactic.

But various types of neck restraint remain within policy in many departments, even in states where its misuse has been a problem. For example, in Sacramento, Calif., where video surfaced over the weekend of the police using a neck restraint on a suspected looter, the tactic is still regarded by law enforcement as a permissible use of force.

The use of neck restraints have come under intense scrutiny after high-profile deaths, including the death of Eric Garner at the hands of the New York Police Department in 2014. The New York Police Department has banned chokeholds since the 1990s, but some officers still use them, and investigators determined that the officer who wrestled Mr. Garner to the ground was using a banned chokehold.

Mr. Garner famously gasped “I can’t breathe” 11 times while lying facedown on the sidewalk, a sentence that Mr. Floyd also said several times.

Elsewhere, Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin on Tuesday urged passage of legislation aimed at minimizing the use of lethal police force, and New Jersey’s attorney general said the state would update its use-of-force guidelines for the first time in two decades. In Maryland, state lawmakers last week announced a bipartisan police reform work group.

Chief Carmen Best of the Seattle Police Department said she was banning the use of tear gas on protesters for at least 30 days and calling for a review of the department’s crowd control tactics. And in Denver, a federal judge on Friday night limited the ability of police officers to fire rubber bullets or use tear gas on protesters.

The temporary restraining order by Judge R. Brooke Jackson of the United States District Court of Colorado, issued in response to a lawsuit filed by four protesters, set specific conditions for when such measures can be used, including that police must keep their body cameras running. It also came with a lacerating rebuke to the Denver Police Department, which the judge said had “failed in its duty to police its own.”

On the 11th night of protests following George Floyd’s death, significant crowds continued to gather in the streets of America’s cities, from New Orleans to Los Angeles to New York, in advance of what was expected to be a huge outpouring of rage against police violence on Saturday, with major demonstrations planned across the country.

In Washington, which has been the site of the some of the largest crowds this week with outrage focused on the White House, thousands of protesters are expected to converge downtown, and the Police Department said it was closing many streets for protests on Saturday beginning at 6 a.m. and lasting until midnight.

Philadelphia: A police inspector, Joseph Bologna, will face two felony counts of aggravated assault and other charges after beating a Temple University student in the head with a baton during a protest earlier in the week, the city’s district attorney said on Friday. A video of the outburst on Monday was shared widely on social media. 

Cleveland: Two Pennsylvania men bent on setting fires and rioting drove across state lines to Cleveland last weekend with a gun and a bottle of fire starter, federal authorities said on Friday after the men were arrested and charged with multiple felonies. An adult and three juveniles who were in possession of fire starters were also arrested during a break-in attempt at Progressive Field, the home of the Cleveland Indians baseball team, the city police said.

Brooklyn: Hundreds of demonstrators marched in the rain outside the Metropolitan Detention Center to protest the death on Wednesday of Jamel Floyd, an inmate who was pepper-sprayed by a guard before he was found unconscious. The Bureau of Prisons said that Mr. Floyd had barricaded himself in his cell and was breaking his cell-door window with a metal object.

Providence, R.I.: A black firefighter said in an interview with WPRI, a local television station, that he was ordered out of his car by police officers at gunpoint on a recent night during a citywide curfew. The firefighter, Terrell Paci, 23, said he was wearing his uniform in a car parked outside of a city fire station when the officers asked if he had a gun and searched the vehicle. The firefighters’ union lamented the incident in a Facebook post, saying, “This situation makes clear that even in uniform — a young black man is not immune from the impact of systemic, institutional racism.” A city spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Miami: A standoff between protesters and police in riot gear closed Interstate 195 in both directions. A line of police officers blocked an exit ramp that the protesters tried to use to enter the expressway, which crosses Biscayne Bay and is a major artery to Miami Beach.

St. Louis: The Metropolitan Police Department released security camera footage from a pawnshop where a retired police captain was fatally shot by a looter on Monday night. President Trump tweeted his condolences to the family of the victim, David Dorn, 77.

Columbus, Ohio: Protesters raised their fists in unison outside the State Capitol ahead of a citywide curfew that remains in effect. Some questioned the need for the curfew, contending that protests in the city had been peaceful. A week ago, protesters smashed several windows of the State Capitol.

Washington: The District of Columbia, which has sparred this week with the federal government over troops being deployed onto city streets, painted a two-block-long mural on the streets leading to the White House. The mural reads “Black Lives Matter,” in yellow street paint and is likely to last well beyond this week’s protests. Mayor Muriel Bowser also renamed 16th Street Northwest, just before the White House, “Black Lives Matter Plaza NW.”

Denver: The University of Denver is one of several colleges and universities nationwide that have rescinded admission to students who were accused of posting racist material online in the wake of George Floyd’s death in police custody, after a social media backlash against the students. “It is clear that we are in a defining moment,” Jeremy Haefner, the school’s chancellor, said in a letter signed by other university administrators.

Kensington, Md.: A cyclist who was captured on video roughly grabbing a young woman on a Maryland trail while she posted fliers against police brutality was arrested and charged Friday with three counts of second-degree assault, the police said.

[gunshots] Police and National Guardsmen in Kentucky are under investigation after David McAtee, a restaurant owner in Louisville, was shot and killed during a heightened moment in the city, when people were protesting police violence. Crowd: “Breonna Taylor!” Kentucky’s governor released videos of the incident, and says police were responding to gunfire when McAtee was shot. But that doesn’t tell the whole story. The Times analyzed those videos, police scanner audio and a livestream filmed by a bystander. We synchronized the videos precisely by lining up key moments, allowing us to see — and most critically, hear — what happened from four different angles. We’ll see how the episode started, and how questionable policing tactics resulted in a fatal outcome. It’s just after midnight on Monday, June 1, when police and National Guardsmen arrive at a busy intersection in West Louisville. They’ve been sent to enforce a dusk-to-dawn curfew imposed by Louisville’s mayor. David McAtee, also known as Yaya, is in his barbecue stand, smoking food for customers. Across the street at Dino’s Food Mart, a local resident, Chris Smith, is livestreaming to Facebook as he hangs out with friends. “We out here. We out here.” His video will provide us with audio of critical moments. “Hold on.” “Police just came.” “Go. In the car and leave, just go.” “I‘m gone, soon as I get my keys.” As the area by Dino’s is cleared, a police officer and guardsman cross the street toward Yaya’s. One police officer readies a weapon as they approach the area. It appears to be a modified paintball gun which the Louisville police used to fire pepper balls, like you see in this footage from a previous incident. “… at us, like, directly at us.” While crossing the street, the officer aims it at the bystanders near Yaya’s, and fires a pepper ball into the curb. Immediately, diners to the front of Yaya’s hurry back along the alleyway, and take shelter inside the building through a side door. McAtee, who hasn’t seen what happened, approaches the doorway from inside. He appears to have a gun holstered on his right hip. McAtee and his niece stand by the door and peer outside. There appears to be no immediate threat to the officers at this moment, but one of them immediately fires at least two pepper balls at them. Let’s watch this back, side by side. McAtee and his niece are by the door. A police officer is aiming the pepper-ball gun at the door. As they peer out, one pepper ball pierces a soda bottle, which falls from the table. Another strikes the doorway, and just misses the head of McAtee’s niece. She ducks and falls back inside. In response, McAtee appears to fire his handgun out the side door. It’s unclear where he’s aiming. [gunshot] “Front door.” We’ll replay this moment from different camera angles to show what happens. The livestream from Dino’s picks up this gunshot. “Where you going? I saw you at the site.” [shouting] The police and guardsmen nearest the restaurant immediately retreat. The officer who fired pepper balls now draws a handgun. “Shots fired, shots fired.” Another officer radios into dispatch, and others take cover in the area. “Shots fired northwest side.” Eight seconds later, McAtee peers out again, and again raises his arm. [gunshots] The same police officer, two guardsmen and another officer fire 18 rounds at McAtee. He stumbles inside, drops a handgun and collapses to the ground. One bullet hit his chest. Louisville police guidelines say officers must avoid the use of force when trying to disperse nonviolent crowds. They must also ID themselves, issue a dispersal order and give people reasonable time to disperse. None of that appears to have happened here. A day after the shooting, the assistant police chief described how officers use pepper balls. “It is police policy when we use pepper-ball spray to actually shoot at the ground.” That also did not happen. Pepper balls were fired into the doorway where people were standing. Kentucky governor, Andy Beshear, said the investigation will continue, and urged the public to examine the video footage frame by frame. “And people can see with their own eyes, and make determinations with their own eyes.” “What do we want?” “Justice.” “When do we want it?” “Now.” “What do we want?” “Justice.” “When do we want it?” “Now.”

As protests over the death of George Floyd sweep the nation, the demonstrations have revealed powerful moments of peaceful protest and in some cases among police officers, who have been seen taking a knee in solidarity, reading the names of police brutality victims out loud or quietly crying alongside protesters.

But the protests have also revealed widespread incidents of police aggression, documented with the same tool that captured Mr. Floyd’s death under the knee of a white police officer in Minneapolis: video.

In Buffalo, two police officers were suspended without pay after a video showed them shoving a 75-year-old protester, who was hospitalized with a head injury. In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Miami Herald reporters filmed officers who were shooting a nonviolent protester in the head with foam rubber bullets, fracturing her eye socket. Cellphone videos show New York City police officers beating unarmed protesters and sideswiping demonstrators with opened squad car doors.

Captured by bystanders and sometimes shown on live television, the episodes have occurred in cities large and small, in the heat of mass protests and in their quiet aftermath. A compilation posted on Twitter by a North Carolina lawyer included over 300 clips by Friday morning.

The episodes have emerged over nearly two weeks of largely peaceful demonstrations in at least 600 cities across America, as thousands of people filled the streets in historic protests against systemic racism and police brutality.

Authorities in the city of Las Cruces in southern New Mexico announced on Friday that a police officer would be fired and charged with involuntary manslaughter in connection with the killing of a man who fled from a traffic stop.

The man, Antonio Valenzuela, 40, died on Feb. 29. The Las Cruces Police Department said he had an open warrant because of a parole violation, and was tased twice by officers while running away after being pulled over. Officer Christopher Smelser then used a chokehold technique on Mr. Valenzuela.

The Las Cruces medical examiner’s office determined this week that Mr. Valenzuela died from the injuries caused by being asphyxiated, the department said.

The death of Mr. Valenzuela, a painter and father of four, has resonated across New Mexico, which was already grappling with some of the highest rates of fatal shootings by police officers anywhere in the United States.

Involuntary manslaughter is a fourth-degree felony. Officer Smelser is also in the process of being fired from the force, said Dan Trujillo, a police spokesman. Officer Smelser could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday, and it was unclear whether he had a lawyer.

The department also said in a statement that the neck restraint technique used on Mr. Valenzuela was prohibited immediately after the episode.

After President Trump renewed criticism of N.F.L. players protesting during the national anthem, Commissioner Roger Goodell delivered his strongest support yet for their right to demonstrate to fight racism and police brutality.

In a swift response to a video montage that featured star players asking the league to address systemic racism, Goodell said he apologized for not listening to the concerns of African-American players earlier and said he supported the players’ right to protest peacefully.

During the 2016 season, Colin Kaepernick started the movement within the league when he knelt to call attention to racial injustice and violence by police, but no team has offered him a contract since then.

Goodell’s comments were diametrically opposed to the president, who spoke out to defend New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees, who said this week that it was disrespectful to kneel during the pregame playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”

Brees apologized on Thursday after immediate backlash. But the president said on Twitter that Brees should not have backtracked and that people should stand when the anthem is played. On Friday night, Brees directed an Instagram post to the president.

“We can no longer use the flag to turn people away or distract them from the real issues that face our black communities,” Brees said. “We did this back in 2017, and regretfully I brought it back with my comments this week.”

More than any other major sports league, the N.F.L. has wrestled in recent years with the issue of race, the lack of African-Americans and other people of color in positions of power in the league and the rights of players to protest social issues on the field. While three-quarters of the league’s players are African-American, nearly every team owner is white and several of the most prominent owners are strong supporters of the president.

We live in a world in which our blackness has been weaponized against us.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada took a knee on Friday, along with hundreds of others, repeating the gesture that in the United States has become synonymous with protest against police brutality against black people.

Kneeling at a large anti-racism march in the capital city, Ottawa, was the latest symbolic move by the prime minister that seemed intended to say more than he’s been willing to share in words.

When asked pointedly at a news conference earlier in the week what he made of President Trump’s call for military action against American protesters and the tear gassing of peaceful demonstrators to make way for the president’s photo-op, the Canadian prime minister paused for an uncomfortable 21 seconds, trying to frame his thoughts.

Finally, he responded diplomatically, “We all watch in horror and consternation what’s going on in the United States.” He then went on to say Canadians needed to address their own problems of systemic racism.

That was not enough for some protesters on Friday, who were captured on television chanting “Stand up to Trump.”

The Ottawa march was one of many on Friday and planned for Saturday across Canada in support of Black Lives Matter protests in the United States, and also in reaction to police brutality in Canada against black Canadians, indigenous people and others.

Attorney General William P. Barr said Friday that law enforcement officers were in the process of following his order to clear Lafayette Park when President Trump decided to walk through it on his way to a nearby church, prompting the officers to use more aggressive means to remove protesters from the area.

“They had the Park Police mounted unit ready, so it was just a matter of execution,” Mr. Barr told The Associated Press. “So, I didn’t just say to them, ‘Go.’”

By making a fine-grained distinction between his Monday afternoon order to clear the park and the tactical decision hours later to use pepper balls and smoke bombs to hurriedly remove clergy and peaceful protesters from Mr. Trump’s path, Mr. Barr was attempting to further distance himself from a controversial incident that ended with the president having his photo taken holding a Bible in front of St. John’s Church.

He said most criticisms of how he handled the situation were illegitimate, and that a rebuke by former defense secretary Jim Mattis was “borne of ignorance of the facts.”

Mr. Trump’s walk was also criticized by the Rev. Gini Gerbasi — the rector of St. John’s Church in Georgetown and a former assistant rector at St. John’s — who was attacked by officers and driven from the church patio.

Mr. Barr’s latest comments shifted the narrative set by White House officials, who had said that he gave the order to clear the park.

Mr. Barr said that a Park Police tactical commander was responsible for how the park was cleared, which led to widespread condemnation when federal officers were caught on video beating a cameraman and using riot shields and horses to contain a mostly peaceful crowd.

David Bernhardt, the secretary of the interior, declined to explain the Park Police’s role, saying on Friday that Democrats’ request for one was an “unacceptable” attack on law enforcement.

In a letter to Representatives Debra Haaland of New Mexico and Raul Grijalva of Arizona, Mr. Bernhardt said park police officers had been “under siege.”

Mr. Bernhardt’s recounting conflicted with multiple eye-witness accounts of the demonstration from reporters, protesters, clergy and others at the scene who said the gathering was nonviolent until park police advanced on protesters, and that some type of chemical irritant was employed.

District attorneys in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx will not prosecute people accused of low-level offenses after being arrested amid the protests against police brutality and systemic racism that entered their second week in New York City on Friday.

Since last week, more than 2,000 people have been arrested in the city on charges like disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, unlawful assembly, assault on a police officer and burglary, according to the police and prosecutors.

On Friday, the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said that he would not prosecute protesters accused of unlawful assembly and disorderly conduct. In a statement, he commended demonstrators who had gathered peacefully and committed no other offenses.

“The prosecution of protesters charged with these low-level offenses undermines critical bonds between law enforcement and the communities we serve,” Mr. Vance said in a statement. “Our office has a moral imperative to enact public policies which assure all New Yorkers that in our justice system and our society, black lives matter and police violence is a crime.”

According to the district attorney’s office, the move affects 71 cases.

Under an existing policy, Manhattan prosecutors dismiss such cases after six months, provided that the accused was not charged with a new crime.

Brooklyn’s district attorney, Eric Gonzalez, has taken a similar stance. He has said his office would review cases in which a desk appearance ticket was issued and then determine whether the case should move forward. In instances where a person was only charged with unlawful assembly or with violating curfew, his office will decline to prosecute.

“We will respond to the arrests here, but we will make sure the prosecution of the individual makes sense and does not trample on the right to assemble,” Mr. Gonzalez said in an interview this week. “We stand for the right of people to protest.”

Mr. Gonzalez’s office has so far declined to prosecute a half-dozen cases.

The Bronx district attorney, Darcel D. Clark, has also declined to prosecute protesters accused of unlawful assembly or violating the curfew. A summons will be issued in such cases instead.

Mr. Vance did not say his office would not prosecute those accused of violating the curfew. He and Mr. Gonzalez have said they would continue to prosecute people accused of violence against officers and looting. Both offices are also investigating allegations of police abuse and brutality against protesters.

A spokeswoman for the mayor’s office did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.

Devora Kaye, a spokeswoman for the Police Department said in a statement, “It is our understanding that each arrest will continue to be looked at on a case-by-case basis.”

President Trump said he hopes that quote, “George Floyd is looking down and seeing” — “this is a great day for our our country.” For the president to try to put any other words, in the mouth of George Floyd, I frankly think it’s despicable. And the fact that he did so on the day when black unemployment rose, Hispanic unemployment rose, black youth unemployment skyrocketed, tells you everything you need to know about this man, and what he really cares about. The fact is that about 13 million fewer jobs today for American workers, than the day President Obama and I left office. So while it’s wonderful to see 10 percent of the families who’ve lost their job due to Trump’s disastrous pandemic response start to make their way back, the president’s behavior makes me deeply worried for the 90 percent who haven’t. It’s time for him to step out of his own bunker. Take a look around, the consequences of his words and his actions. Let’s be clear, the president who takes no responsibility for costing millions and millions of Americans their jobs, deserves no credit when a fraction of them return.

President Trump was pilloried by Democrats on Friday for declaring during a speech on the economy that it was a “great day” for George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis after his neck was pinned under the knee of a white police officer.

“Hopefully, George is looking down right now and saying this is a great thing happening for our country,” Mr. Trump said. “A great day for him, a great day for everybody. This is a great day for everybody. This is a great day in terms of equality.”

Mr. Trump’s comments drew immediate condemnation from former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, the president’s Democratic challenger. “George Floyd’s last words, ‘I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe,’ have echoed all across this nation and quite frankly around the world,” Mr. Biden said in a speech on Friday. “For the president to try to put any other words in the mouth of George Floyd I frankly think is despicable.”

Mr. Trump’s comments on Mr. Floyd were delivered as he glanced down at a piece of paper during an otherwise scattershot speech to briefly address the need for law enforcement officials to treat Americans fairly.

“Equal justice under the law must mean that every American receives equal treatment in every encounter with law enforcement regardless of race, color, gender, or creed,” Mr. Trump said in the Rose Garden. “They have to receive fair treatment from law enforcement.”

But his comments drew outrage from those who were appalled that Mr. Trump was tying Mr. Floyd’s killing to a bright spot in the American economy.

“Keep George Floyd’s name out of your mouth until you can say Black Lives Matter,” Senator Kamala Harris of California, a possible vice-presidential pick for Mr. Biden, tweeted at the president.

In interviews with several of his allies this week, Mr. Trump has largely declined to address a larger effort to curb police violence.

Facebook said on Friday that it had removed nearly 200 social media accounts connected to far-right hate groups that had tried to rally followers to infiltrate the George Floyd protests.

The social network said it removed 80 Facebook accounts and 50 Instagram accounts associated with the white supremacist group American Guard, and 30 Facebook accounts and 30 Instagram accounts linked to the Proud Boys, another hate group.

Both groups had previously been banned from the company’s networks, but such bans are hard to enforce because new accounts can crop up — often under aliases — as quickly as old ones are removed. Facebook said the two groups had re-emerged on social media and were calling for people to join protests against racism and police violence, sometimes with weapons.

“These groups were planning to rally supporters and members to physically go on the ground to the protests, in some cases preparing to go with weapons,” Brian Fishman, Facebook’s director for counterterrorism and dangerous organizations, said on a call with reporters.

Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy, said the site had also removed a third batch of accounts that included those of users masquerading as members of Antifa, the loose-knit, far-left antifascism activist movement.

Mr. Gleicher said that third group of accounts was linked to an account that Twitter took down on Monday, a move reported earlier by NBC News. The owner of that account posed as an Antifa member aiming to incite violence during the protests.

Facebook said it had not seen foreign interference on its site related to the protests, even as its security teams were actively scouring the social network for signs of meddling. Attorney General William P. Barr had said on Thursday that the federal government had seen evidence of “foreign actors playing all sides to exacerbate the violence.”

A woman who witnessed the arrest of Manuel Ellis, a black man in Tacoma, Wash., called on the police to “stop hitting him” after they wrestled Mr. Ellis to the ground, according to a video of the arrest.

Mr. Ellis died in the minutes following his arrest in March after pleading, “I can’t breathe” — an eerie echo of some of the final words from other black men who have died in police custody, including Eric Garner and George Floyd.

The woman captured video clips showing brief portions of the arrest of Mr. Ellis, 33, including punches that officers threw while he was on the ground. She was in her car and had pulled up right behind the police vehicle on the southern edge of Tacoma late on the night of March 3.

After the videos were posted online, Tacoma’s mayor, Victoria Woodards, released a video message late Wednesday night saying she was enraged by what she saw and was directing the city manager to fire each officer involved.

“The officers who committed this crime should be fired and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” Ms. Woodards said.

The first video captured by the witness begins in the middle of the encounter, showing both officers standing, right as they took Mr. Ellis to the ground on the road in front of some garbage cans. With Mr. Ellis on his back, one of the officers got down on his knees and began punching Mr. Ellis.

“Stop. Oh my god, stop hitting him. Just arrest him,” the witness called out in the video.

In a later clip, as she drove past the scene, video showed the officers asking Mr. Ellis to put his hands behind his back. The officers appeared to have Mr. Ellis subdued and on his side.

Detective Ed Troyer of the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department, which is handling the investigation, said Mr. Ellis at one point called out “I can’t breathe,” and the officers called for medical support.

Trump Speaks at West Point Graduation Amid Tensions With Military Leaders,"President Trump told the Army’s newest officers on Saturday that they will not have to serve in “endless wars” being waged in “far away lands,” but made no mention of his thwarted effort in recent days to deploy the active-duty military to the streets of American cities over the objections of Pentagon leaders.

In a commencement ceremony at the United States Military Academy at West Point that had been postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic before the president insisted on moving forward with it, Mr. Trump presented himself as a staunch supporter of the armed forces who has increased spending on tanks, aircraft and other weapons even as he said they should not be used in fruitless foreign conflicts.

transcript

West point is a universal symbol of American gallantry, loyalty, devotion, discipline and great skill. There is no place on Earth I would rather be than right here with all of you. To the 1,107 cadets who today become the newest officers in the most exceptional army ever to take the field of battle, I am here to offer America’s salute. Thank you for answering your nation’s call. The members of this class have come from every state in our union. You have come from the farms and the cities, from states big and small, and from every race, religion, color and creed. But when you entered these grounds you became part of one team, one family, proudly serving one great American nation. You became brothers and sisters pledging allegiance to the same timeless principles, joined together in a common mission to protect our country, to defend our people and to carry on the traditions of freedom, equality, and liberty that so many gave their lives to secure. Every graduate on this field could have gone to virtually any top-ranked university that you wanted. You chose to devote your life to the defense of America.

“We are ending the era of endless wars,” Mr. Trump said. “In its place is a renewed cleareyed focus on defending America’s vital interests. It is not the duty of U.S. troops to solve ancient conflicts in far away lands that many people have never even heard of. We are not the policeman of the world. But let our enemies be on notice: If our people are threatened, we will never, ever hesitate to act. And when we fight from now on, we will only fight to win.”

The president’s address skirted the more acute issue of the last few days as he threatened to order active-duty troops to put down demonstrations against racial injustice that have been predominantly peaceful but marred at times by looting and rioting. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, successfully resisted the president, leaving a deep schism between the commander in chief and the military.

Mr. Trump alluded to the national reckoning over race following the killing of George Floyd only elliptically by noting that West Point graduates were among those who “fought and won a bloody war to extinguish the evil of slavery” during the Civil War and were “at the forefront of ending the terrible injustice of segregation” during the civil rights era.

“What has historically made America unique is the durability of its institutions against the passions and prejudices of the moment,” Mr. Trump told the cadets. “When times are turbulent, when the road is rough, what matters most is that which is permanent, timeless, enduring and eternal.”

The president’s critics have condemned him for exploiting the military and for forcing West Point to hold commencement in person when other schools canceled theirs. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside West Point on Saturday, holding signs like “Cadets Aren’t Props” and “Welcome Cadet Bone Spurs.” Others showed support for the Black Lives Matter movement.

Laura Vetter, an instructor for 18 years at West Point before retiring last fall, was among those who said she was protesting on behalf of West Point graduates who are not allowed to make political statements in uniform. “The day I retired my muzzle came off,” she said.

Tsui Pappas and her son Armand Pappas said they were protesting partly in honor of two graduating cadets they declined to name. “I’m here to protest for Black Lives Matter but also to honor their graduation,” Armand Pappas said. “They can’t be here to protest even though I know they’d like to.”

Inside the gates, it was a commencement ceremony like none other in the 218-year history of West Point. Graduating cadets who had been isolated for 14 days in advance of the event marched onto the field in their dress gray-and-white uniforms and face masks. They sat in white folding chairs spaced six feet apart, at which point they were allowed to take their masks off. The West Point band played with plexiglass shields to protect against the virus.

Rather than march onto stage to shake the president’s hand as is customary, the cadets instead saluted the commander in chief from below the stage as their names were called. Mr. Trump saluted back. No family or friends were allowed to attend, but the cadets were permitted to throw their caps into the air as is traditional.

Neither Mr. Esper nor General Milley was on hand, although officials said their decisions not to attend were made before the latest conflict with the president. Mr. Esper, a West Point graduate, sent a video congratulations played on jumbo video screens on the field.

Mr. Trump included in his speech some of his favorite claims from the campaign trail, including taking credit for rebuilding a military that he characterized as “totally depleted” when he took over and investing “over two trillion — trillion, that’s with a T — dollars” in the armed forces. As he often does, he exaggerated. Military spending has increased substantially since he took office, from $607 billion a year to $713 billion, but in using the $2 trillion claim Mr. Trump gave himself credit for the entire military budgets over three years rather than just the increases.

Likewise, he hailed himself for victory in the battle against the Islamic State in the Middle East. “The savage ISIS caliphate has been 100 percent destroyed under the Trump administration and its barbaric leader al Baghdadi is gone, killed, over,” he said. While it is true that American forces killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and recaptured territory it once held, the terrorist organization has carried out a series of attacks in Syria and Iraq over the last two months.

The president’s appearance at West Point came at a fraught moment in the history of civilian-military relations in the United States. Mr. Esper and General Milley, both appointed to their positions by Mr. Trump, resisted the president’s demands to send active-duty troops into the streets, first in an Oval Office meeting that turned into a heated argument and later in public comments.

The tension was accentuated by the president’s walk through Lafayette Square to St. John’s Church after peaceful protesters were forcibly pushed out by riot police, a photo op that both Mr. Esper and General Milley joined to their later regret amid vociferous criticism from retired military officers like Jim Mattis, the Marine general who served as Mr. Trump’s first defense secretary.

Mr. Trump wanted to fire Mr. Esper after he spoke out publicly against invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807 to send active-duty troops into the streets but was advised against it by aides who feared it would be a political debacle. General Milley, for his part, considered resigning before opting against it for now but made a point of publicly apologizing for participating in the president’s church photo op because it inserted the military leadership into a partisan event.

The friction grew over the last few days as Mr. Esper, General Milley and other military leaders signaled that they were open to renaming Army installations named after Confederate generals, including Fort Bragg, Fort Hood and Fort Benning, as part of a broader effort to address the legacy of racism in the armed forces.

But Mr. Trump, who never served in the military and avoided the Vietnam War citing bone spurs in his foot, slapped down the Pentagon by rejecting the idea, suggesting it would be insulting to the troops who trained at those bases and then went off to fight in overseas wars.

The issue has resonance at West Point, where Gen. Robert E. Lee was both a cadet and later superintendent. The Confederate icon remains honored on campus, with a gate, a road and a barracks named after him and his portrait on display. Some critics, including veterans, have called for his name to be removed from the campus.

Mr. Trump made no mention of the issue during his speech, but did single out Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, the Union commander, for praise, although mispronounced his first name as “Ulysseus.”

The president’s desire to deliver a commencement address at West Point in person was already a contentious decision. Cadets were sent home in March because of the coronavirus but after Mr. Trump announced that he would go through with plans for a speech they were ordered back to campus and quarantined in their dorms for the past 14 days to safely stage the ceremony.

As they awaited Mr. Trump on Saturday, the graduating cadets, who over the past two weeks had been divided into four pods of around 250 each, dining in separate shifts, were assembled into a full crowd in a quad away from the ceremony site. Reunited as a class, few if any appeared at that moment to be trying to maintain social distance as recommended by public health officials.

The ceremony was the first since 1977 that was not held in Michie Stadium, the West Point football venue, because it did not have enough room on the field to keep all 1,107 cadets six feet apart. Instead, it was held on the main parade ground called the Plain with no audience in attendance.

Mr. Trump marched to the bandstand and cannons fired a 21-gun salute that echoed across the mostly empty field. The unusual seating arrangement put some graduates facing two large screens instead of the stage, even though it was only about 100 feet from their chairs. But it was a visual that a president campaigning for re-election would surely cherish.

Klobuchar Drops Out of Biden’s V.P. Search and Backs Picking a Woman of Color,"WASHINGTON — Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota announced late Thursday that she was withdrawing from consideration to be the running mate to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on the Democratic ticket.

Ms. Klobuchar, who mounted her own campaign for the presidency before dropping out and becoming one of Mr. Biden’s most spirited surrogates, said during an MSNBC interview that she called Mr. Biden on Wednesday night and told him he should choose a woman of color to be his running mate.

Ms. Klobuchar, a moderate and veteran of the Senate like Mr. Biden, was known to have a strong rapport with the presumptive Democratic nominee, and was an early favorite of a significant number of his donors and supporters. But her case for being Mr. Biden’s running mate was badly damaged after the Memorial Day killing of George Floyd in the custody of Minneapolis police officers. The death, which has prompted weeks of demonstrations and protests against police violence across the country, led to renewed scrutiny of Ms. Klobuchar’s career as a local prosecutor in Minneapolis.

“After what I’ve seen in my state and what I’ve seen across the country, this is a historic moment and America must seize on this moment,” she said. “I truly believe, as I told the vice president last night, that I believe that this is a moment to put a woman of color on that ticket.”

In a Twitter post late Thursday, Mr. Biden praised Ms. Klobuchar and described her as a key ally in the contest to beat President Trump in November.

Mr. Biden committed to naming a woman as his vice-presidential pick during a debate with Senator Bernie Sanders on March 15. His team’s search committee has contacted roughly a dozen women, and eight or nine are being vetted more intensively, according to people familiar with the process.

Senator Kamala Harris of California, who also ran against Mr. Biden and is the only black woman in the Senate, is widely regarded as a strong candidate for the vice-presidential slot. Several other black women are being vetted by Mr. Biden’s search committee, including two whose prospects have risen as the national debate over racial justice amplifies calls for him to select a woman of color: Representative Val Demings of Florida and Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta. Mr. Biden is also considering Susan E. Rice, the former national security adviser under President Barack Obama, the people familiar with the process have said. 

Ms. Klobuchar was still being vetted until her Wednesday night phone call to Mr. Biden, according to a person familiar with Mr. Biden’s running mate selection process. But in conversations earlier this week, Ms. Klobuchar suggested to friends that she recognized that her own history made it difficult for Mr. Biden to select her, given the widespread Black Lives Matter protests. 

As the district attorney in Hennepin County, which encompasses Minneapolis, Ms. Klobuchar developed a tough-on-crime reputation 20 years ago that is a difficult fit with modern Democratic Party politics. Though she has rebutted criticism that she failed to prosecute police misconduct, her record was scrutinized during the presidential campaign and would quite likely have become a major headache for Mr. Biden’s campaign had he selected her as the running mate. 

One person she spoke with on Monday said Ms. Klobuchar relayed then that she understood she would not be selected, and said she cited the scrutiny of her record as prosecutor. A Klobuchar spokeswoman disputed the recollection of the call. 

Ms. Klobuchar’s declaration that Mr. Biden should choose a woman of color created something of an awkward political dynamic for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, another former presidential rival who is being considered by Mr. Biden as a possible running mate. Ms. Warren is the most prominent and formidable white candidate in the running, and she is far along in the vetting process.

Other white candidates under consideration include Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island. 

Asked by the MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell if her past record as a prosecutor would have made it difficult for her to “function” as Mr. Biden’s running mate, Ms. Klobuchar said it was not a factor in her decision. 

“I think I could have functioned fine,” she said. “There’s a lot of untruths out there about my record and now is not the time to debate them.”"
Security Concerns Give the White House a Fortified New Look,"WASHINGTON — President Trump was furious when news got out last weekend that as protesters gathered outside the White House he had been rushed to an underground bunker. But now, as crowds keep coming back to demonstrate, the entire White House seems to be turning into one.

Every day, more fences go up and more concrete barriers are put in place as the security perimeter expands farther and farther. The universally recognized symbol of American democracy increasingly looks like a fortress under siege in the heart of the nation’s capital, a Washington version of the Green Zone that sheltered American and Iraqi officials in Baghdad during the worst of the war.

The measures taken over the last week have made the compound occupied by the president, his family and his staff more sealed off from demonstrations but also more removed from the American public. National Guard troops and riot police will certainly withdraw at some point, and White House officials say the barriers will be eventually removed. But history shows that security changes made at the White House in the heat of a momentary perceived threat often become lasting fixtures.

With the capital awash in security forces and much of downtown boarded up, Washington officials bristle at the martial moment and fear that the city is being transformed once more in a way evoking locked-down authoritarian nations instead of an open, pluralistic society.

“Keep in mind that that’s the people’s house,” Mayor Muriel E. Bowser said this week even as she sent Mr. Trump a letter asking him to withdraw extra security forces from the streets. “It’s a sad commentary that the house and its inhabitants have to be walled off.”

Ms. Bowser sent a signal of her own overnight, dispatching city workers on Friday to paint the words “Black Lives Matter” in giant yellow letters covering the entirety of two blocks of 16th Street leading toward the White House. She also posted a sign renaming the area Black Lives Matter Plaza and on Friday night projected the slogan on nearby buildings while protesters chanted: “Whose house? Our house.”

Mr. Trump fired back on Friday evening. “.@MayorBowser is grossly incompetent, and in no way qualified to be running an important city like Washington, D.C.,” he wrote on Twitter. “If the great men and women of the National Guard didn’t step forward, she would have looked no better than her counterpart Mayor in Minneapolis.”

His aides stressed that the security changes around the White House were not ordered by Mr. Trump but were made at the direction of the Secret Service based on its assessment of the security situation. Small fires were set as close as a block away from the compound last weekend, including one that did minor damage at the iconic St. John’s Church, and a few protesters penetrated a barricade near the Treasury Department, next door to the White House. The authorities said dozens of law enforcement personnel had been injured in scrapes with protesters.

But while the demonstrations near the White House have been predominantly peaceful, especially as the week has progressed, Mr. Trump shows no discomfort with the increasing security. He has embraced the idea of military units in the streets of the capital, seeing it as a demonstration of strength and berating governors for not using the National Guard more in their states.

“They came in, and this was like a piece of cake,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Rose Garden, sheltered behind the new fencing and surrounded by security. “Call in the National Guard. Call me. We will have so many people, more people then you have to dominate the streets. You can’t let what’s happened happen. It’s called dominate the streets.”

transcript

We have fantastic military, we have fantastic National Guard. National Guard was barely used and these people have done an unbelievable job. They helped the Secret Service at Washington — Secret Service by the way are unbelievable. The job they did at the White House is unbelievable. There was never any form of like, Oh gee, this sounds dangerous. All I could see is what I was seeing on television. But they were outside and the Secret Service was incredible. But we were also helped by the D.C. police, and we were helped by the National Guard was unbelievable. They came in and they — this was like a piece of cake. And I really am suggesting, because if you look at Minnesota and the great success we had there and other places, I’m suggesting to some of these governors that are too proud in New York — I mean you see what’s going on there. Don’t be proud. Get the job done. You’ll end up looking much better in the end. Call in the National Guard. Call me. We’ll have so many people. More people than — you have to dominate the streets. You can’t let what’s happening happen.

The Secret Service said on Friday that it was closing off the areas beyond the 18-acre White House compound until June 10 but did not explicitly say whether the barriers would then come down. “These closures are in an effort to maintain the necessary security measures surrounding the White House complex, while also allowing for peaceful demonstration,” it said in a statement.

With the demonstrations still ongoing, the White House was bracing for the possibility of hundreds of thousands of protesters descending on Washington on Saturday. The White House declined to discuss the matter on the record. “The White House does not comment on security protocols and decisions,” said Judd Deere, a spokesman.

But another official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss security protocols, said there was no intention to make the new fencing and concrete barriers permanent and compared the expanded perimeter to the temporary measures taken when Pope Francis visited President Barack Obama in 2015.

For now, at least, the images are jarring. “The White House is the people’s house,” said Lindsay Chervinsky, a presidential historian at the Institute for Thomas Paine Studies at Iona College. “The American people own it, pay for it and permit the president to live there. The fencing and barriers show that Trump is rejecting his predecessors’ example and instead concealing himself from the American people.”

Plenty of critics and commentators compared the additional barriers around the White House to the wall he is building along the nation’s southern border, a small-scale manifestation of his desire to wall off outsiders. In this case, the outsiders are not foreigners but fellow Americans.

“If Trump erected more than three miles of fence around the White House, it would exceed the length of his new wall on the southern border,” Anthony Scaramucci, who served briefly as Mr. Trump’s White House communications director before breaking with him, wrote on Twitter. “His bigotry is only exceeded by his incompetence.”

For now, at least, the new security perimeter has annexed Lafayette Square, a leafy landmark with its signature statue of Andrew Jackson on horseback just north of the White House, where for a couple hundred years city residents, tourists, protesters and cranks have strolled, shouted and speechified.

A new chain-link fence about eight feet tall was first erected this week along the park’s northern edge, forcing the demonstrations farther away from the White House. The fencing has now been extended down 17th Street, along the western side of the White House compound, and about halfway along Constitution Avenue, the southern border of the Ellipse. Concrete barriers have been put behind the fencing in many places. Stacks of fencing segments were piled on 15th Street on Friday for workers to complete the perimeter.

The barriers reflect a radical evolution since the early days of the mansion. Thomas Jefferson, the first president to live eight years in the building, installed a low, wooden and rail fence and later a stone wall, but the grounds were kept open to the public. In 1833, according to the White House Historical Association, the stone wall was cut down and a heavy wrought-iron fence was installed along Pennsylvania Avenue. Ulysses S. Grant expanded the grounds and the iron fencing.

For generations, the public largely had the run of the grounds during daytime, treating it as an open park of sorts. Jackson invited thousands into the mansion itself on his Inauguration Day, a moment of populist mayhem that served as a metaphor for his presidency.

Irritated that visitors were trying to photograph his daughter, Grover Cleveland closed the South Grounds in 1893, and William Howard Taft restricted the North Grounds to certain days in 1913. Still, outsiders managed to wander in from time to time, including one who slipped into the building and watched a movie in the dark with an unsuspecting Franklin D. Roosevelt.

The grounds were closed altogether to the public during World War I and World War II, and the first version of the bunker that Mr. Trump would later be taken to was built under Roosevelt in case of enemy attack. In addition, soldiers camped on the grounds and gun crews were stationed on the roof. But Roosevelt rejected deploying tanks outside the mansion “because it might look as if our democracy was under siege,” as the historian Michael Beschloss noted.

Protests were permitted along Pennsylvania Avenue and in Lafayette Square during the Vietnam War, close enough that Lyndon B. Johnson could hear them chanting, “Hey, hey, L.B.J., how many kids did you kill today?” But when President Richard M. Nixon feared protesters against his Cambodia incursion in 1970 would storm the White House, the authorities surrounded the building with buses.

In 1995, after a drunken pilot crashed a Cessna 150L onto the South Lawn, a gunman opened fire at the White House from outside the gates and militia members blew up a federal building in Oklahoma City with a truck bomb, Bill Clinton closed Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicle traffic.

The street was further closed to pedestrian traffic for three years after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and the bunker under the White House where George W. Bush was brought during subsequent terror scares has since been upgraded. After intruders made it onto the grounds during Mr. Obama’s presidency, the government designed a more formidable 13-foot steel fence with what the police called “anticlimb and intrusion detection technology” to replace the historic one about half as tall.

As it happens, construction on that new fence began only last year and is not scheduled to be completed until next year."
Peaceful Protesters Defy Curfews as Violence Ebbs,"This live briefing has ended. Click here for the latest updates.

Protesters returned to the streets on Tuesday from California to Pennsylvania, while the nation’s capital sizzled with tension a day after a highly criticized episode outside the White House in which law enforcement officers used tear gas on peaceful protesters in order to clear a path for President Trump. 

The public spectacle on Monday and the arrival of dozens of military vehicles on Washington’s streets on Tuesday seemed to underscore the president’s latest threat — to use the military to crack down on violence and looting — as it emerged that it was Attorney General William P. Barr who ordered officers to clear Lafayette Park on Monday in time for Mr. Trump to walk to a historic church and have his picture taken there.

On Tuesday night, more than 1,000 protesters remained near the park after a 7 p.m. curfew, facing police officers across a tall chain-link fence erected overnight.

“You’re in the cage now!” one protester yelled. Another said, “Our tax dollars at work.”

But the crowd remained peaceful in a mood that appeared to be taking hold in other cities, too. When a few demonstrators began to rock the fence, they were quickly stopped. “Use your words,” two women yelled. “Don’t do that.”

The tensions earlier in the day in Washington reflected a nation on edge, ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic, skyrocketing unemployment and now a public reckoning with systematic racism and police brutality. 

Daily protests have spread to at least 140 cities, in a sprawling expression of anger and frustration after the killing in Minneapolis last week of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black security guard, who died after his neck was pinned under a white police officer’s knee for nearly nine minutes. The officer has been charged with murder. 

Though planned protests have largely been peaceful, the national unrest has also come with escalating tensions, including attacks on law enforcement, injuries and deaths of protesters and others on the streets, and widespread looting and destruction. Police officers in several cities have been fired or disciplined for using excessive force.

Officials across the country remained on guard Tuesday for another night of chaos. Here is the latest from around the country.

Philadelphia: Hundreds of protesters gathered outside City Hall by Tuesday afternoon, after a night of explosive tension. Mayor Jim Kenney defended a decision to use tear gas on protesters Monday but condemned a group of largely white men who had been seen patrolling the largely white neighborhood of Fishtown holding baseball bats. “Armed vigilantism will not be tolerated moving forward,” he said. However, no arrest has been made after the owner of a South Philadelphia gun shop opened fire early Tuesday morning on four men who smashed through the front door of his business, killing one of the men.

Atlanta: Police and military personnel used tear gas to disperse a large crowd gathered near Centennial Olympic Park shortly after the city’s 9 p.m. curfew, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The crowd broke up soon after the confrontation.

New York: Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that an 8 p.m. curfew would be imposed all week after a night of looting in Manhattan. He acknowledged that the previous 11 p.m. curfew had failed to quell the violence that marred the peaceful protests of previous days. After an hourlong standoff between the police and demonstrators at the entrance to the Manhattan Bridge, the protesters were eventually allowed to cross back to Brooklyn.

Charlotte, N.C.: Protesters and police skirmished in the city center after the authorities ordered the crowds to disperse. Video showed police officers surrounding demonstrators and using stun grenades and pepper spray and pepper pellets, which was criticized by a black state lawmaker who represents Charlotte. The police said that they would conduct an internal review of the episode, but that officers were hit by bottles and rocks, and that a protester threw what they called a chemical agent at an officer on a bicycle. One protester who was arrested was in possession of a military-style rifle and two 30-round magazines, the police said.

California: Protesters filled the streets of Hollywood with chants of “Black lives matter,” a crowd of protesters gathered along a beach in San Francisco and the city of Santa Monica enacted among the strictest curfews in the nation, starting at 2 p.m. local time. The Los Angeles Police Department made hundreds of arrests throughout the city Tuesday night, said a spokesman, Officer Tony Im.

St. Louis: President Trump tweeted his condolences to David Dorn, a retired police captain whom the police said was shot by a looter at a pawnshop on Monday night. Mr. Dorn died the same night four active-duty police officers were shot during protests.

They tried to keep the gathering as secret as possible. No announcements, no social media. Don’t talk to strangers, don’t talk to the press; police spies could be anywhere.

“I guarantee you there are agents in your midst,” said Melina Abdullah, a professor at California State University, Los Angeles, and a Black Lives Matter leader.

About 200 protesters were called to a small park in Koreatown on Tuesday afternoon by the leaders of Black Lives Matter L.A. The plan: Walk the 15 minutes to Getty House, the official residence of Mayor Eric Garcetti, and then fire up social media.

“When you get there, livestream away,” Ms. Abdullah said.

The demonstration outside the gates of the mayor’s mansion quickly swelled to hundreds as word spread around the city, and protesters waving placards streamed down some of the city’s fanciest residential streets, past mansions and manicured lawns.

The location was chosen to highlight the group’s demand that the mayor reduce the police budget. The mayor himself was at City Hall, preparing to give his daily news conference.

As the 6 p.m. curfew approached, some protesters started leaving, but many stayed behind, vowing to hold the streets — “Our streets!” they chanted.

A crowd of more than a thousand people marched to the city’s emergency operations center, demanding to speak with Mayor Jenny Durkan. After some of the group’s leaders were invited inside, Ms. Durkan stood on the building’s steps and addressed protesters for the first time since demonstrations erupted in the city last week. 

The mayor agreed to work with protesters to reform the Police Department, which is under a federal consent decree. When pressed for a specific timeline, Ms. Durkan responded, “What are you doing tomorrow?” 

They agreed to meet at 3 p.m. 

The protest leaders asked people to submit their ideas for change to a new Gmail account they had established, yelling out the address letter by letter through a loudspeaker.

Ms. Durkan, gripping a blue medical mask in her hand, stopped short of agreeing that police officers would not use tear gas again Tuesday evening, as the department had the previous night. “I am not going to stand up and make a promise I am not going to keep,” she said.

After Ms. Durkan left, the protesters began marching through downtown, stopping at one point to take a knee. The group split at an intersection, with marchers shouting above the noise of chanting and helicopters, debating whether to join another group of demonstrators near where the police used tear gas on Monday evening.

Police officers used pepper spray on Tuesday in Puerto Rico as more than 200 protesters wearing gas masks broke a 7 p.m. curfew. The protest, organized by Colectiva Feminista, demanded a stop to racism and police brutality in the island. 

“Where are the anti-racist people? We are here,” hundreds chanted on the cobblestone streets. “And we are not afraid.”

Protesters blamed local officials for black lives lost. 

“Don’t tell us you don’t see racism here,” Gloriann Sacha Antonetty, 39, said. “Because we don’t only see it. We feel it in our skin.”

Washington, D.C.

On Tuesday afternoon, less than two hours before Washington’s 7 p.m. curfew went into effect, U.S. troops positioned military vehicles across the city. 

The crowd of protesters in Lafayette Square was at least twice the size from the day prior and swelling.

Following the arrival of the troops and the use of helicopters to suppress protesters on Monday night — a tactic fitting for battles with insurgents but now applied to American citizens — some in the crowd whispered that more soldiers were on the way. 

Alec, a 32-year-old protester who spent two deployments in Afghanistan, said he had seen things over the past two days that he never expected to see in his own country. 

“There are real problems here,” Alec said, declining to give his last name because he works for the government, “and no amount of uniforms or soldiers are going to fix them.”

“They’re only going to get worse,” he said.

President Trump this week responded to the unrest roiling the nation by visiting two religious sites and calling for more military intervention. On Tuesday, both moves were greeted with criticism from many of his rivals, as well as some of his sometime allies.

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the likely Democratic nominee for president, said during a speech in Philadelphia that the nation was “crying out for leadership.” And Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, wielding her own Bible and quoting from the Book of Ecclesiastes, criticized Mr. Trump for being a “fanner of the flame” of division. 

Two Republican senators, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Tim Scott of South Carolina, and some moderate Democrats in conservative-leaning districts joined in the criticism. Representative Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, a former C.I.A. officer, called his response the type of action “undertaken by authoritarian regimes throughout the world.”

Mr. Trump was also criticized by Christian leaders after visiting two religious sites in Washington — on Monday he posed holding a Bible outside St. John’s Church, and on Tuesday he and his wife spent about 10 minutes inside the St. John Paul II National Shrine.

“I find it baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people, even those with whom we might disagree,” Archbishop Wilton Gregory of Washington wrote in a statement.

And the Rev. Gini Gerbasi, an Episcopal priest who had been on the patio of St. John’s when nearby protesters were sprayed with tear gas, said in an interview, “They took what literally had been holy ground that day and turned it into a literal battleground.” 

Following President Trump’s vow on Monday to “dominate” demonstrators, the federal government has mobilized its law enforcement agencies across the country, from border agencies and the Drug Enforcement Administration to F.B.I. hostage rescue teams, working alongside local law enforcement, the military police and the National Guard.

Nowhere is the show of force as strong as in Washington, where Mr. Trump is seeking to flood the city’s downtown with agents from the F.B.I., the Bureau of Prisons, the U.S. Marshals, Customs and Border Protection and several other agencies, along with the military, turning the nation’s capital into a heavily armed federal fortress. 

Even Transportation Security Administration officers have been called out of the airports to help protect federal property in the “national capital region,” the agency said.

The Justice Department on Tuesday confirmed that Attorney General William P. Barr is managing the federal law enforcement response. It was Mr. Barr who ordered federal officers to clear peaceful protesters out of Washington’s Lafayette Park on Monday so that President Trump could walk to a historic church and have his picture taken there, according to a Justice Department official who was not authorized to discuss the matter.

In warnings that echoed the threats issued by Mr. Trump, Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said Tuesday that the federal government would control the protests “at any cost.”

“D.H.S. and its partners will not allow anarchists, disrupters and opportunists to exploit the ongoing civil unrest to loot and destroy our communities,” Mr. Wolf said. 

The Pentagon announced late Tuesday that a battalion of combat troops from an Army quick-reaction force based at Fort Bragg, N.C., had moved into the Washington area, as well as a military police headquarters unit from Fort Bragg and a military police battalion from Fort Drum, N.Y.

In all, about 1,600 troops were being deployed to the Washington area, the statement said, noting that they would be stationed initially at nearby bases outside of the District of Columbia. In a statement, the Pentagon called the troop movements “a prudent planning measure.”

Law enforcement officers have been targeted in attacks in cities across the country in recent days, with officers wounded in gun battles in St. Louis and Las Vegas and others injured when they were run over by cars in New York City and Buffalo.

But officers also have been charged, or fired, in several states by police and government leaders trying to preserve and defend demonstrators’ right to protest while also restoring order after days of violence and lawlessness. The swirl of emotions and instructions and events, Manny Fernandez of The Times reports, have made it a volatile time to be a police officer in America.

The Las Vegas police on Tuesday identified both a man who was killed by officers and an officer who was gravely wounded in two separate shootings the night before. The officer, Shay K. Mikalonis, 29, was in grave condition after being shot in the head, and a 20-year-old suspect was arrested. In another shooting, the Las Vegas police killed Jorge Gomez, 25, who they said raised a pistol at officers after they had hit him with “low lethal” shotgun rounds. 

In St. Louis, four officers were struck by gunfire in a shootout between gunmen at a protest and the police. The officers’ injuries were believed to be “non-life threatening,” Chief John Hayden of the St. Louis Police Department said at a news conference. 

In New York, an officer was in stable condition after being run over by a black sedan early Tuesday in the Bronx, and in Buffalo the driver of an S.U.V. was arrested after speeding through a line of law enforcement officers in riot gear and injuring two of them in an episode that was caught on video. The driver now faces several felony charges.

But the police also have been the subject of complaints about their actions. 

Officials in Atlanta said arrest warrants had been issued for six police officers after video footage showed them Tasing and assaulting two college students in a car while enforcing a curfew. In Richmond, Va., the Police Department apologized and said it would discipline officers who used tear gas on protesters on Monday. And in Denver, an officer was fired after sharing a photo of himself and two other officers in riot gear on Instagram on Monday with the caption “Let’s start a riot.”

In Louisville, police officials said a restaurant owner killed on Saturday had fired a gun before he was fatally shot, by either a police officer or a National Guard soldier. On Tuesday, Mayor Greg Fischer and police commanders held a news conference to release images from two security cameras. Neither camera gives an unobstructed view of what happened, and neither has sound.

The restaurant owner, David McAtee, 53, was killed shortly after midnight on Monday, and has been cited as an innocent victim of the violent turmoil rocking the country. Before the day was over, Mr. Fischer dismissed the city’s police chief because the officers at the scene had not activated their body cameras.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

Today: The Minneapolis police officer whose tactics led to George Floyd’s death had a long record of complaints of misconduct. My colleague, Shaila Dewan, on why he was still patrolling the streets.

It’s Tuesday, June 2.

Shaila, you have been covering the criminal justice system and the cops for a really long time. So what were you thinking as you watched the video of George Floyd’s death?

Well, at first, I didn’t actually watch the video. I read about it, and I have seen too many of those videos. And it just is too painful. I knew what I needed to know right then to do my job, which was immediately to find out more about the officers who were involved in the incident and what we knew about them, what we could tell about them.

So we wanted to look immediately to see their work histories and whether they had had problems in the past. I mean, sometimes it can be really, really difficult to find out the history of an officer, especially if you need to do it quickly. There is a lot of secrecy around police records. Sometimes they just only keep complaints for a certain amount of time, sometimes you can’t see complaints at all.

So we use a variety of sources of information from civil lawsuits — that’s often a really good way to see details about what happened. We look at news accounts. So we just try to pull it from wherever we can find. Often, it’s a patchwork.

But Minneapolis is actually unusual in the sense that they have a searchable database online. And pretty quickly they put out a list of the complaints for each officer involved in the case. So in the case of Officer Chauvin, who was the guy who had his knee on George Floyd’s neck for over eight minutes — he had at least 17 complaints against him in his 19-year history. But we can’t see what the complaints were about.

And we found that the vast majority of those resulted in no discipline. There were two letters of reprimand placed in his file. We could also see that he was the subject of a brutality complaint.

And we know that he was involved in three shootings over the course of his career. In one of those, the man said that Officer Chauvin came into his house, and the man did not have a gun. There was a domestic violence call. And he says that Chauvin burst through the bathroom door, started hitting him and then fired two shots in his abdomen.

Wow.

He says that Chauvin basically shot him unprovoked. And Chauvin said that the guy was going for his gun.

So you’re saying that despite all these complaints, Chauvin was never suspended, he wasn’t docked pay, he wasn’t really punished at all. I guess, to the degree he was punished, it was some kind of wrist slapping.

That’s right. Like I said, there were two letters of reprimand placed in this file. And there’s an account of one verbal reprimand for using derogatory language in a demeaning tone.

And what about the other officers on the scene when George Floyd dies? What did you find out about them?

So the officer who Chauvin and arrived at the scene with, Tou Thoa, had six complaints against him on his list. And he also was the subject of a civil lawsuit that said he basically handcuffed a guy and then beat him up. And that resulted in a $25,000 settlement.

But what about repercussions for that officer as a member of the Minneapolis police department?

Again, it doesn’t seem like that officer was ever disciplined by the police department.

I mean, how is that possible that neither of these officers face any real punishment, stayed on the force despite these complaints, and stayed in the kind of line of work where they would respond to a street incident like the one involving George Floyd?

Well, it’s not just possible. It’s notoriously common in this country. Our systems are basically set up to protect police officers from repercussions for their actions. That’s been noted over and over again. And it’s even been bitterly complained about by police chiefs who come in wanting to make changes and wanting to reform their departments and clean them up, and even they are sometimes prevented from doing that by the systems that are in place.

What do you mean?

Well, Minneapolis is actually a perfect example of this. They’ve had two police chiefs who were heralded as reformers. The current chief in fact, sued the department for what he said were racist hiring practices before he became chief. And when I read that he had fired these four officers almost immediately, my first thought was, I don’t know if that’s going to stick. He may be forced to rehire those guys because of all the protections that officers have.

I mean, so what exactly is happening here? I mean, what is getting in the way of these police chiefs running their departments the way that they want to, reforming them if they want to, and disciplining cops who cross the line?

So many things. There are so many things that work together to put these obstacles in place. They’re just kind of enshrined parts of the job. And it can be sort of helpful to break them out into buckets.

So there are five main reasons why it’s so hard to hold the police accountable for their actions. The first one is that the police are often policing themselves. Departments have internal affairs divisions that are part of the department usually. And those officers take complaints and investigate them, and come back and say what they think happened and what they think the consequences should be. And they tend to be charitable towards their own.

And what’s an example of this?

Well, for example, in Minneapolis in 2010, it was almost like a precursor of the Floyd case, where a man named David Cornelius Smith was held down by two officers. One of them had a knee on his neck for four minutes. He ended up dying. And the officers, after an internal affairs investigation, were never disciplined. In fact, the police chief at that time praised them for handling a tough situation.

OK, so what’s the second system that tends to block the disciplining of cops?

The second system this is really interesting civil service protection. Basically, public employees are allowed to appeal firings or other discipline to an independent body. And a lot of times with cops, they are given a lesser punishment when they appeal. Or if they’ve been fired, they’re reinstated. And in the Minneapolis area, The Pioneer Press did an analysis of this. And they found that the Minnesota board that deals with these cases reinstated law enforcement officers 46 percent of the time after they were fired.

So half the time that a cop was somehow fired for misconduct, this system puts them back in their jobs, basically overrules the punishment?

That’s right. And one interesting thing is that — sometimes the board would say there wasn’t enough evidence. But sometimes they would say, you know, you can’t punish this officer this way because there are prior examples of someone doing the same thing, and they didn’t get this severe of a punishment. So what that means is if you have a reformer coming in who wants to clean up, who wants to stop being lenient and wants to get tough on officer discipline, they’re going to be hamstrung by what was done in the past. So if somebody does something completely unacceptable in their eyes and they fire them, someone can come along and say oh, other officers that have kicked people were only given a suspension. So you can’t fire this guy.

So arbitration relies on a kind of precedent system, and the precedent has been not to punish these cops too severely. So it’s like a self-reinforcing cycle in which no person involved in arbitration is likely to break out of that system too far.

That’s right.

OK, what is the third bucket here?

That’s the concept of civilian review. And I hate the use of the word civilian, because it implies that the police are not civilians, which they are. But it’s this idea that non-police officers should be able to review the actions of police and complaints against the police and determine whether the police are meeting community standards for behavior.

They might be able to watch the body camera footage. They might be able to call in witnesses. And then typically they would make a recommendation. And sometimes the police department can just ignore the recommendation of the civilian review board. They’re a lot of times non-binding.

So they’ve kind of, over time, been seen as toothless. And Minneapolis is actually a perfect example of the kind of push and pull over how are we supposed to police the cops. They’ve had a civilian review board and then dismantled it, and had it again and dismantled it. And then finally a few years ago, they just did away with it altogether and replaced it with a police conduct review panel.

And the city maintains that this panel works much better. It is made up of appointed civilians and police together. Critics say that complaints from the public are still largely disregarded.

It’s important to keep in mind, of course, that any member of the public can lodge a complaint for any reason, and often, they are very unhappy when they have an interaction with the police. So it’s not uncommon to find many civilian complaints unfounded. But the percentage that this one organization cited to me that keeps track of such things is that out of 2,600 complaints that originated with the public, only 12 resulted in discipline. And the city has since come back to dispute that figure, but it is certainly a very low percentage of complaints that result in discipline.

Suggesting that this panel frequently does not punish cops based on public complaints?

That’s right.

We’ll be right back.

So the fourth reason why it’s hard to hold police accountable is the police unions. And these are the organizations that represent the rank-and-file members. It’s their job, basically, to protect police jobs. So they’re often led by kind of old-school, law-and-order individuals who are often the biggest opponent of reform-minded chiefs who come in. That is often a real source of clashing and tension.

And is that the case in Minneapolis?

Minneapolis is actually a textbook example of this. The union president, Bob Kroll, is a very controversial figure. He himself has had 29 complaints against him as a police officer. He is a Trump aficionado who stood on stage with him and thanked him for letting cops do their jobs. He has been blamed by the previous police chief for blocking reforms, for being one of the biggest opponents to cleaning up the department. And he’s already saying that he’s going to fight to get the jobs back of the four officers that were involved in the Floyd killing. So that’s the guy who represents the rank-and-file Minneapolis police officers. So if you have somebody who’s just saying you’ve got to defend officers at all costs sort of no matter what they do, that’s a banner that some cops could choose to walk under.

So Shaila, I mean, with all that in mind, how much power does any police chief in the country — I mean, even the most reform-minded variety of police chief — really have to try to discipline cops given the obstacles?

I think it is really hard, even as we’ve seen public attitudes shift dramatically, and the unions just have so much power in this equation.

OK. By my count, we are on system number five that keeps police from being disciplined.

That’s right, system number five is a big one. And that’s the difficulty of holding police criminally accountable for their actions. And that’s a lot due to a legal concept called reasonable fear. So even if you overcome prosecutor’s reluctance to charge police officers, and even if you overcome jury’s reluctance to convict officers, officers still have a lot of protection. And that’s built up on the idea that they have very difficult, dangerous jobs where they have to make split-second decisions. And you can’t really second guess them. So if an officer can make an argument that a reasonable officer would have been afraid for their life, or for the life of a fellow officer in that moment, then the jury is not supposed to convict them. And that’s a pretty big hurdle to overcome if what you think is that police need to be sent to prison. And that’s the system that we’ve set up for the courts.

And of course, Minneapolis has charged Officer Chauvin with murder. It sounds like you’re saying that if that charge is brought to a trial, that this concept of reasonable fear could be a major argument in his favor and could make it very hard to prosecute him.

I mean, there’s already a lot of talk about what a jury might do in this situation and how hard it will be to prove this case. Certainly, nobody thinks it’s going to be an easy case to prove.

Shaila, all these systems that we are discussing as potential impediments to disciplining cops, I have to think that all of them were put in place for a reason, and maybe even at first a good reason.

I mean, sure. There’s two sides to all of these stories. So of course, as an employee, you don’t want to be at the whim of an unreasonable boss. So you want the protection of being able to appeal. I think we can all understand how a union protects workers. And no one thinks that police officers have an easy job. But I think there’s something even deeper going on here, which is that these systems come out of a failure of trust — that police officers simply don’t trust, and maybe for good reason, that the public could possibly understand them or their choices or their jobs, or what they’re really facing. And so they can’t contemplate subjecting themselves to that kind of public scrutiny.

And so that belief kind of permeates all of this.

It permeates all of this.

You know, it’s interesting, almost by definition, whether you think that these systems are problems or you think that they offer necessary protections to cops, they feel quite entrenched. And they feel kind of immovable.

This is a system that, even an institution that wants to change itself, can’t overcome its architecture. And this is why you see the rage on the streets. Those are people who, I think, viscerally feel that architecture. And the only thing they can see to do is dismantle it. They don’t think that it’s about tweaking it or adjusting it. It’s about tearing it down.

Thank you, Shaila.

Thank you, Michael.

On Monday afternoon, the medical examiner’s office in Hennepin County, Minnesota released the results of a preliminary autopsy on George Floyd. The office classified his death as a homicide, saying that his heart stopped as police, including officer Chauvin, restrained him and compressed his neck.



We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today.

You have been dominated. If you don’t dominate, you’re wasting your time. They’re going to run over you. You’re going to look like a bunch of jerks.

In a conference call with governors on Monday, President Trump lashed out at them for what he described as their inadequate response to the protests, demanding, quote, “retribution against the demonstrators for the unrest.”

You have to arrest people, and you have to try people. And they have to go to jail for long periods of time. I saw what happened in Philadelphia.

A few hours later, in his first remarks from the White House since the protests began, Trump called the violent scenes unfolding across the country, quote, “acts of domestic terror,” and said he was prepared to step in if local officials failed to contain the demonstrations.

If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.

Outside the White House on Monday night —

[EXPLOSION SOUNDS]

— police used tear gas and flash grenades to push back protesters who were peacefully demonstrating in Lafayette Park, so that the president could pose for photos at a church on the park’s edge that had been damaged during protests the night before. As of Monday night, at least 40 cities, including Washington and New York, have imposed curfews to try to discourage the protests.

That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.

Former President George W. Bush on Tuesday praised peaceful protesters and called for empathy for people seeking justice after George Floyd’s death, saying “achieving justice for all is the duty of all.”

Mr. Bush rarely comments on developing events, and has generally avoided anything that could be construed as criticism of President Trump. 

“Laura and I are anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country,” Mr. Bush said in a statement, referring to his wife.

“It remains a shocking failure that many African Americans, especially young African-American men, are harassed and threatened in their own country,” Mr. Bush said.

Mr. Bush, who condemned the looting that has taken place in several cities, is a flawed messenger on the subject of race. His administration’s failures during and after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 primarily affected black residents in New Orleans and Louisiana.

But by recognizing that the “doctrine and habits of racial superiority, which once nearly split our country, still threaten our Union,” Mr. Bush offered a stark contrast to Mr. Trump, who has emphasized law and order but said nothing about systemic abuses against black people by law enforcement.

“We can only see the reality of America’s need by seeing it through the eyes of the threatened, oppressed and disenfranchised,” Mr. Bush said.

“Many doubt the justice of our country, and with good reason,” he said. “Black people see the repeated violation of their rights without an urgent and adequate response from American institutions.”

The state of Minnesota has started a human rights investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department, citing evidence of systematic discrimination against people of color, particularly black people, state officials announced on Tuesday.

The state Department of Human Rights made a formal charge of discrimination against the police force based in part on the May 25 death of George Floyd, which has sparked demonstrations across the country. 

The charge referred to a pattern of incidents in Minneapolis dating back at least 10 years that demanded investigations into the Police Department’s training and policies, and its “use-of-force protocols.”

“There is sufficient information to investigate whether the respondent utilizes systemic discriminatory patterns or practices towards people of color, specifically black community members, on the basis of race,” the charge stated.

I don’t have a lot to say, because I can’t get my words together right now. But I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took. At the end of the day, they get to go home and be with their families. Gianna does not have a father. He will never see her grow up, graduate. He will never walk her down the aisle. If there’s a problem she’s having and she needs her dad, she does not have that anymore. I’m here for my baby, and I’m here for George, because I want justice for him.

Investigations by the Department of Human Rights do not lead to criminal charges, but if investigators find wrongdoing, state officials can attempt to force changes in the Police Department’s practices, which could include the state’s suing the police force.

Also Tuesday, the Minneapolis school board voted unanimously to end its contract with the Police Department, a pointed response to the death of Mr. Floyd.

The school district is believed to be the first in the nation to sever its relationship with a police department, one advocacy group said, marking a significant victory for activists who have long argued that allowing officers in schools contributes to the school-to-prison pipeline that channels black and Hispanic students into the penal system at disproportionately high rates. 

“This is the systemic change that this moment calls for,” said Judith Browne Dianis, the executive director of the Advancement Project, a civil rights organization that has worked to get the police out of schools. “There can be convictions of the police officers, but at the end of the day we know that we need structural change. And the school board’s decision gives us that type of victory.”

In a unanimous vote during a special meeting held virtually on Tuesday, the board adopted a resolution saying that the actions of the Minneapolis police officers involved in Mr. Floyd’s death “run directly counter to the values the district seeks in partners.” The decision means that the school resource officers the department provides will no longer be present in schools.

Anger at George Floyd’s killing has rippled far beyond the United States to many world capitals, where crowds have gathered to denounce police violence and racism.

An estimated 15,000 people in Paris defied police orders to gather at the city’s main law court on Tuesday. Demonstrators, most of them young, waved signs reading “No justice, no peace” or “I can’t breathe,” in direct reference to Mr. Floyd’s death.

The protests were led by the family of Adama Traoré, a 24-year-old black man who died near Paris in 2016 after having been tackled by the police. Shouts of “Justice for Adama” regularly punctuated the clapping and chanting of the crowd.

“We protest for George Floyd, for Adama, for all the others and for the next ones,” said Anne-Sophie Kiminou, a 28-year-old office manager.

The Paris police said in the afternoon that the demonstration was forbidden during the country’s public health emergency, which bans any public gathering of more than 10 people. Paris is one of the last areas of France where the coronavirus is still considered active, and many protesters wore masks.

[protesters chanting]

Lolly Nzamba, 18, said France had a two-tier justice system that ignored the daily suffering of black people. “Personally, I’m afraid when I go out in the street and come across the police,” she said. But she added that Mr. Floyd’s death had changed people’s understanding and would help raise awareness. 

“There will be a before and an after,” Ms. Nzamba said.

Also Tuesday, thousands gathered for a march in Sydney, Australia, and chanted “Enough is enough” while kneeling outside the American consulate. In London and Rio de Janeiro, demonstrations of solidarity have also prompted soul searching over local racial divisions.

Family of Atlanta Shooting Victim Disputes Police Account,"This briefing has ended. Follow our live coverage of Atlanta, Black Lives Matter and police protests here.

Atlanta’s police chief resigned on Saturday, less than 24 hours after a white police officer shot and killed an African-American man at a Wendy’s drive-through who had run from the police after failing a sobriety check and taking an officer’s Taser, the authorities said.

The officer who shot and killed Rayshard Brooks, 27, was later terminated, Sgt. John Chafee, a spokesman for the Atlanta Police Department, said early Sunday. He identified the officer as Garrett Rolfe.

The shooting ignited angry protests that led to the apparent burning of the Wendy’s where Mr. Brooks was shot, and to the blocking of roads and an interstate near the restaurant. Police officers used tear gas and flash grenades to try and clear the crowds.

Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said that security footage appeared to show that Mr. Brooks had fired the Taser toward the officer, who was chasing him before he was killed.

But in a news conference in downtown Atlanta on Saturday night, L. Chris Stewart, a lawyer for the Brooks family, disputed the official account of the shooting.

He said that witnesses told his team that they did not see the police conduct a field sobriety test on Mr. Brooks. He said they did see him talking with officers in a “civil” manner while standing outside of his car.

Mr. Stewart repeatedly said that a Taser was not considered a deadly weapon, and that there was no reason to shoot Mr. Brooks because he had one in his hands. He also said that the police could have easily cornered Mr. Brooks and arrested him, instead of chasing him and shooting him.

“His life was not in immediate harm when he fired that shot,” Mr. Stewart said of the officer.

He said the officers put on plastic gloves and picked up their shell casings before rendering first aid to Mr. Brooks. He said they waited more than two minutes before checking for a pulse.

Throughout the news conference, Mr. Stewart struck a weary tone, saying he was sick of seeing the same kinds of cases over and over again.

“The one thing that nobody can disagree with is that it shouldn’t have happened, but it did,” he said. “Because the value of African-American males’ lives in the inner city or wherever doesn’t mean too much to officers these days. And it’s sad.”

One by one, the activists, legislators and relatives of people hurt and killed in confrontations with the police stared into their phones and laptop cameras on Saturday and spoke out about ambitious legislation that seeks to transform policing and public safety in Minnesota.

It was the emotional first day of hearings and debate on a package of measures being proposed by Democratic legislators in the wake of the killing of George Floyd.

The hearing unfolded virtually because of the coronavirus, so instead of stepping up to a lectern to address lawmakers seated in their State Capitol chambers, community members spoke from their living rooms and offices as cars whooshed by, babies squawked and shaky internet connections marred their voices.

“Here we are again,” said Valerie Castile, whose son, Philando, was shot and killed by a police officer in a St. Paul suburb in 2016, his last moments captured in a grim video. “We as a community don’t have a voice in anything. We need our voices heard.”

Democrats have proposed nearly 20 measures that have been grouped into three bills now beginning to make their way through the divided Legislature.

The bills would ban chokeholds and “warrior training” for police officers, increase oversight and tracking of officers’ use of force and disciplinary records and make Minnesota’s attorney general responsible for prosecuting killings by law enforcement. It would also restore voting rights to thousands of people convicted of felonies.

Many of the proposals are not new, and have been proposed year after year. They have the backing of Minnesota’s Democratic governor and are expected to pass the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives early this week. But Republicans, who control Minnesota’s Senate, have vowed to oppose some of the most ambitious parts of the Democratic agenda, and have said they plan to stay in session only through the end of next week.

On Saturday, most of the people testifying spoke in favor of the legislation, saying that years of efforts to retrain police and pass incremental reforms had failed people of color.

“We’re ready for actual real concrete changes, transformational changes,” said JaNaé Bates, who works with a coalition of faith groups that seek racial and economic justice.

“We’re ready build something new, something different.”

Thousands of people rallied against police brutality and racism in European cities on Saturday, punctuating a week of protests across the continent, but far-right demonstrators also emerged in large groups for the first time — particularly in London — leading to sometimes violent confrontations that included attacks on police officers.

The anti-racism marches and rallies in Europe, energized by demonstrations in the United States in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, have led to destruction of statues linked to slavery and demands for a reckoning with racial discrimination. The European protesters have denounced the bigotry within their own countries and demanded that the authorities address it.

But Saturday was the first day when far-right groups and protesters, most of them white, fiercely pushed back. The situation grew especially tense in London, where crowds of white male counterprotesters clashed repeatedly with the police.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, who just a day earlier had criticized the anti-racism demonstrations and exhorted Britons to avoid them, denounced the far-right attacks on the police as “racist thuggery.” Mr. Johnson said the protest marches had been subverted by violence and declared that “racism has no place in the U.K.”

The Metropolitan Police said in a statement that more than 100 people had been arrested by day’s end for offenses that included “breach of the peace, violent disorder, assault on officers, possession of an offensive weapon, possession of class A drugs, and drunk and disorder.”

The protest and counterprotest came to an explosive head in Trafalgar Square, when small numbers of Black Lives Matter supporters and their antagonists threw bottles and booming fireworks against one another, while the police tried to separate them.

In Paris, some 15,000 people rallied to demand justice for Adama Traoré, a 24-year-old who died in 2016 after the police had arrested him. Amid the overwhelmingly young crowds, demonstrators waved signs reading “No justice, no peace” and “Black Lives Matter,” less than two weeks after 20,000 protesters had assembled in front of a Paris court for Mr. Traoré. The Saturday protests were organized by “The Truth For Adama,” an advocacy group led by Mr. Traoré’s sister, Assa Traoré. The rally remained largely peaceful, although police officers threw tear gas and clashed with protesters in the late afternoon.

“In France, we have a tendency to deny thorny issues like race,” said Isabelle Blanche, a 41-year-old black protester who came with her brother. She said that it had taken Mr. Floyd’s death in the United States “for people to finally wake up.”

President Trump told West Point graduates that they would not serve in “endless wars” being waged in “far away lands,” but he made no mention of his conflicts with military leaders in recent days about the role of the armed forces during times of trouble on American soil.

In a commencement ceremony at the United States Military Academy that had been postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic before the president insisted on moving forward with it, Mr. Trump presented himself as a staunch supporter of the armed forces who has increased spending on new weapons even as he said they should not be used in fruitless conflicts.

His address skirted the more acute issue of the last few days as he threatened to send active-duty troops into the streets of American cities to put down demonstrations against racial injustice that have been predominantly peaceful. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, resisted the president, leaving a deep schism between the commander in chief and the military.

Near the academy, hundreds of protesters gathered to protest President Trump’s speech, holding signs that read “Cadets Aren’t Props” and “no more years.”

Some of them stressed that they supported the cadets and considered themselves part of the West Point community.

Dr. Anne Sumers, a retired ophthalmologist who lives nearby in Montrose, N.Y., and one of the organizers of the protest, has for many years befriended cadets, offering home-cooked meals and a civilian shoulder to lean on, especially for cadets whose families live far from West Point.

Laura Vetter, an instructor for 18 years at West Point before retiring last fall, was also among those who felt she was protesting on behalf of the West Point graduates who are not allowed to make political statements in uniform.

“The day I retired my muzzle came off,” she said.

Most of the protesters were wearing face coverings while the law enforcement officers monitoring them did not. One demonstrator used a megaphone to announce that he had bandannas and hand sanitizer for those who need them.

President Trump’s decision to delay a campaign rally in Tulsa, Okla., rather than hold it on the day that marks the end of slavery in the United States, came in part after intervention by Senator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, the senator said on Saturday.

The senator said he told the president it would be “more respectful” to avoid holding the rally on June 19, the date known as Juneteenth and considered a holiday by many African-Americans.

Mr. Lankford spoke with the president on Friday and during the call, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Lankford “if I thought it would be more respectful to move the rally date off of Juneteenth,” the senator said in a statement.

The Trump campaign’s decision to hold a rally on Juneteenth in Tulsa, where one of the bloodiest outbreaks of racist violence in American history took place, had sparked widespread criticism, particularly in the wake of national protests following the killing of George Floyd.

Mr. Lankford told the president that he felt it would be more respectful to change the date, and Mr. Trump, according to Mr. Lankford’s account, then asked the senator to find a better date. Mr. Lankford then reached out to some of the local event organizers, and “they expressed that they would be grateful to the President if he moved the rally to Thursday the 18th or Saturday the 20th.”

The president ultimately decided to hold the event on June 20, making the announcement in a Twitter announcement late on Friday.

“We had previously scheduled our #MAGA Rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for June 19th — a big deal,” he wrote. “Unfortunately, however, this would fall on the Juneteenth Holiday. Many of my African-American friends and supporters have reached out to suggest that we consider changing the date out of respect for this Holiday, and in observance of this important occasion and all that it represents. I have therefore decided to move our rally to Saturday, June 20th, in order to honor their requests.”

The White House and the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.

The Minneapolis Police Department was in many ways a poster child for change: it had two chiefs hailed as reformers, had trained officers on implicit bias, reconciliation and how to treat the public with respect. It had tried to overhaul its early warning system and disciplinary process for officers. It had even, back in 2016, instituted a duty for officers to intervene if they saw other officers doing something wrong.

Last week, it agreed to institute a duty to intervene — again.

As a reporter covering criminal justice, I have seen this over and over: Urgency over a needless death at the hands of the police is funneled into reports on what went wrong. Commissions on how to do better. Policy changes that do not translate into cultural changes.

My colleague Mike Baker, who has been closely following the protests in Seattle, and I were asked to assess what had changed since the last big national reckoning on policing, in 2014, after the deaths of Eric Garner in Staten Island and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. Our findings: not enough.

After Ferguson, one of the biggest problems was the lack of data on use of force by the police and deaths in police custody. But the big national projects launched to track those things have yet to materialize. It is no wonder that protesters today are skeptical of reform measures.

Last week, Valerie Castile, the mother of Philando Castile, who was fatally shot during a traffic stop in a Minneapolis suburb in 2016, participated in a panel discussion. She didn’t mince words about all the working groups she has consulted with over the years: “I think we’ve covered everything you could possibly imagine about what we should do and what we could do, but nothing is being implemented.”

Even if the former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin is found guilty of murdering George Floyd, he will qualify to receive what could amount to around $50,000 a year in state pension payments.

But how much of that money he will see is less certain: Members of Mr. Floyd’s family, who are expected to file a wrongful-death lawsuit against Mr. Chauvin and the city, may be able to seize his pension distributions if they obtain a sizable judgment.

Some states force public employees who are convicted of serious crimes to forfeit their state pensions. But Minnesota does not, and the agency that distributes them said that could be changed only by legislative action.

Former employees qualify for benefits “if they meet length-of-service requirements, regardless of whether termination of employment was voluntary or involuntary,” the agency, the Minnesota Public Employees Retirement Association, said in a statement. “Under state law, being charged or convicted of a crime does not impact a member’s benefit.”

Mr. Chauvin, 44, faces up to 40 years in prison if he is convicted of second-degree murder. He was a 19-year veteran of the Minneapolis police force before being fired and paid into a state pension system.

After analyzing police payroll, salary and contract information, CNN estimated that Mr. Chauvin’s annual payments would be around $50,000 or more if he elected to begin receiving distributions at age 55.

“I couldn’t look at myself in the mirror if I weren’t here,” said James Luckey, 21, who grew up on Staten Island.

“It was this feeling of helplessness, like I’m not supposed to leave my house, but this is wrong, so wrong, and they’re going to get away with it unless there’s a huge group of people to draw attention to how wrong this is,” said Belinda Stahl, 29, who grew up in Maine and was adopted from Peru by a white American family.

“To be silent is to be complicit,” said David Dacosta, 32, who immigrated from Jamaica. “I can’t do that anymore.”

They and others emerging from different corners of New York City are movement newbies.

Mostly in their 20s and 30s, they call this their personal turning point. No longer, they say, could they just post on Instagram, or just give money, or just vote. They needed to put their bodies on the street after the killing of George Floyd.

So they protested.

For many, it’s their first movement. Their chance to be a part of history, they say. For some, a moment to examine who they are.

They are the United States’s largest and most racially diverse generations, and they are part of a global generational revolt erupting at a time when strongman leaders have ascended around the world.

Pentagon Denies Spying on Americans Protesting Police Killings,"WASHINGTON — A top Pentagon official has told Congress that the nation’s military intelligence agencies did not spy on American protesters during the wave of nationwide demonstrations against the police killings of African-Americans.

In a letter on Thursday to the House Intelligence Committee, Joseph D. Kernan, the under secretary of defense for intelligence and security, said he had received no orders from the Trump administration to conduct such surveillance, and he underscored citizens’ constitutional right to protest peacefully.

But he reminded lawmakers of the role of Pentagon intelligence agencies to help defend against foreign interference in American domestic political affairs.

Without mentioning any specific role Pentagon spy agencies might have played in monitoring foreign activities during the recent protests, Mr. Kernan acknowledged that such clandestine efforts could be misconstrued.

“Given the complex and classified nature of foreign intelligence collection, it is not always readily apparent to the American public how lawful foreign intelligence collection and analysis differs from unlawful intelligence activities rightfully prohibited by U.S. law and D.O.D. policy,” he wrote, using the initials for the Defense Department.

In the two-page letter, which the committee made public on Friday, Mr. Kernan stressed that he had “not been asked by anyone in the administration or the Department of Defense to undertake any unlawful or inappropriate intelligence activities that could violate civil liberties in association with the domestic civil disturbances.”

Mr. Kernan said that the directors of the Defense Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency “have all personally assured me they have not received or made any such requests” to spy on Americans.

Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, who leads the committee, asked the Pentagon this week to address concerns raised by some intelligence agency personnel in the Defense Department who feared they might be compelled to help conduct surveillance on Americans participating in demonstrations.

The letter came after the administration was roundly criticized for rushing thousands of National Guard and federal law enforcement personnel to the streets of the capital to help in the crackdown on mostly peaceful protesters and occasional looters after the death of George Floyd in the custody of the Minneapolis police.

The deployment of U.S. military intelligence units on American soil in support of domestic law enforcement operations is unusual, but it has happened before.

In 2002, at the request of the F.B.I., the Army deployed secret surveillance planes as part of a broadening effort to catch a sniper in the Washington area.

To do so in support of ferreting out foreign interference here — for example, to determine if another country was trying to provoke greater unrest on the streets — would be even more unusual. American military officials said on Friday that they were not aware that had happened during the recent protests.

Intelligence and Pentagon officials said they had been closely monitoring the protests for any sign of attempts by Russia or other foreign powers to seize on the racial tensions, but so far they have noted only public statements by Russian officials criticizing the United States for its handling of the demonstrations.

The Russian government has in recent months increased efforts to inflame racial tensions in the United States as part of its bid to influence the presidential election in November, including trying to incite violence by white supremacist groups and to stoke anger among African-Americans.

Russia’s lead intelligence agency, the S.V.R., has apparently gone beyond methods of interference in 2016, when operatives tried to stoke racial animosity by creating fake Black Lives Matter groups and spreading disinformation to depress black voter turnout. Now, Russia is also trying to influence white supremacist groups, American officials said.

“Our country faces a myriad of foreign bad actors attempting to interfere in our political process, and those threats are only likely to increase as we approach the 2020 elections,” Mr. Schiff said in a statement. “Constant vigilance, robust congressional oversight and greater transparency will be necessary to combat that interference.”

The militarized response to the protests, however, has prompted some military spy agency personnel to express fears of overreach.

During an unclassified virtual gathering last week, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lt. Gen. Robert P. Ashley Jr., fielded questions from employees about whether they could be ordered to support domestic intelligence efforts to investigate protesters, according to an account first published by Yahoo News.

“The mission of the Defense Intelligence Agency is to provide intelligence on foreign militaries to prevent and win wars,” James M. Kudla, an agency spokesman, said in an email. “Any claims that D.I.A. has taken on a domestic mission are false.”"
Corrosive Effects of Tear Gas Could Intensify Coronavirus Pandemic,"SEATTLE — The billowing clouds of tear gas that the authorities are sending through protest crowds across the United States may increase the risk that the coronavirus could spread through the gatherings.

Along with the immediate pain that can cause watering eyes and burning throats, tear gas may cause damage to people’s lungs and make them more susceptible to getting a respiratory illness, according to studies on the risks of exposure. The gas can also incite coughing, which can further spread the virus from an infected person.

Sven-Eric Jordt, a researcher at Duke University who has studied the effects of tear gas agents, said he had been shocked to watch how much the authorities had turned to the control method in recent days.

“I’m really concerned that this might catalyze a new wave of Covid-19,” Mr. Jordt said. The virus has been linked to more than 106,000 deaths in the United States.

The protests after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis have already raised alarm among health experts who have watched as protesters gathered by the thousands in cities around the country. While some demonstrators have worn masks and gloves, the crowds have often involved shouting and chanting in close quarters — a risky activity for a virus spread by respiratory droplets.

But the addition of wafting gases, which have been used widely by police forces in recent nights, has added an uncertain new element of risk to the scene.

In research conducted by the U.S. Army, examiners looked at the impacts of exposure that thousands of Army recruits had to the common riot-control agent known as CS gas or tear gas. The study conducted in the summer of 2012 found that the personnel in a basic training cohort had a substantially high risk of being found to have an acute respiratory illness in the days after exposure than the days before.

The risk increased the more people were exposed, the researchers said.

The miserable initial effects of tear gas — including stinging in the eyes and throat — typically lasts for only 15 to 30 minutes after a person who has been exposed gets to an area with cleaner air. But many of the illnesses in the Army research surfaced days after exposure. Researchers cautioned that illnesses were not lab-checked, and could have been caused by damage to the respiratory tract rather than infection, or could have been prompted by other factors.

A study in Turkey examining the long-term effects of tear gas found that people who had been exposed had a higher risk for chronic bronchitis.

Tear gas has been around for decades, used around the world as a riot-control tool, including in Hong Kong during recent uprisings there. Treaties prohibit its use during war.

Mr. Jordt said he worried that the effects on healthy, young military recruits may also not fully capture the risks to people who are older or have underlying conditions. He said more research was needed on tear gas generally, since much of the research was decades old, but that it had been difficult to get funding to examine the issue.

The protests after Mr. Floyd’s death have focused on the disproportionate impacts of police killings on black Americans, with protests led by groups such as Black Lives Matter. People of color have also been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus pandemic, with higher rates of hospitalizations and deaths than white people.

Researchers have long found that smoking can cause damage to upper airways and increase the risk of lung infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that conditions such as asthma and chronic lung disease can increase the risk of someone getting a severe coronavirus illness.

The C.D.C. has said that prolonged exposure to riot-control agents may lead to long-term effects to eyes and breathing problems such as asthma.

The use of tear gas to disperse protesters has been the subject of criticism from organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union.

Jamil Dakwar, the director of the A.C.L.U.’s Human Rights Program, said tear gas had become an overused tactic that could actually increase the volatility of a situation. He said the weapons that were so indiscriminate should not be used for dispersing people or in protests.

“It has become a first-resort weapon rather than a last resort,” Mr. Dakwar said.

Mr. Dakwar said he would like to see state and federal legislation that would restrict the use of those techniques. While the A.C.L.U. was not advocating an outright ban, he said the priority should be on de-escalation techniques.

Mr. Dakwar said the gas was so indiscriminate that he also worried about the health effects on police officers."
"Christopher Columbus Statues in Boston, Minnesota and Virginia Are Damaged","Statues of Christopher Columbus were damaged in Minnesota, Boston and Richmond, Va., as protesters angered by the death of George Floyd have continued to direct some of their frustration toward monuments, including Confederate statues, that they consider to be symbols of racism.

Outside the State Capitol in St. Paul, Minn., a 10-foot bronze sculpture of Columbus came toppling down on Wednesday afternoon after a group of protesters tied ropes around the statue’s neck and yanked it from its pedestal. 

The demonstrators kicked the head of the statue, which was dedicated in 1931, and danced around it. Minnesota State Troopers did not intervene.

The group included local Native Americans, according to reporters at the scene. Native Americans around the country have rejected the legacy of Columbus as an explorer. 

The Capitol is about 10 miles from where a Minneapolis police officer pinned his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for nearly 9 minutes.

In Boston, the head of a statue of Columbus in the city’s North End neighborhood was removed overnight on Tuesday, and pieces of it were found nearby, Sgt. Detective John Boyle of the Boston police said on Wednesday. Detectives were investigating the incident, he said.

In Richmond on Tuesday evening, a Columbus statue was torn down and tossed into a lake in a city park where protesters had gathered for a demonstration in support of Indigenous peoples.

“We stand in solidarity with black and brown communities that are tired of being murdered by an out-of-control, militarized and violent police force,” the Richmond Indigenous Society, which took part in the rally, said in a statement on Wednesday.

“As for the statue,” the society added, “it seems very appropriate that it ended up in a lake.”

Mayor Marty Walsh of Boston said at a news conference on Wednesday that the damaged Columbus statue would be removed and stored while city officials discuss whether it should be returned to its location in Christopher Columbus Park, where the six-foot statue had stood atop a five-foot base since 1979.

“We are going to be taking the statue down this morning and putting it into storage to assess the damage of the statue,” Mr. Walsh said. “This particular statue has been subject of repeated vandalism here in Boston and, given the conversations that we’re certainly having right now in our city of Boston and throughout the country, we’re also going to take time to assess the historic meaning of the statue.”

About 1,000 protesters attended the rally at Byrd Park in Richmond, where the Columbus statue was damaged. Demonstrators carried signs that said “This land is Powhatan land” and “Columbus represents genocide,” according to The Richmond Times-Dispatch.

The statue was spray-painted, set on fire and thrown into a lake in the 287-acre park, according to WWBT-TV. Near the bank of the lake where the statue was submerged, someone placed a sign with a drawing of a headstone and a message: “Racism, you will not be missed.”

The statue was removed from the lake on Wednesday. The city’s Police Department did not immediately respond to an inquiry about the statue on Wednesday.

The statue, which was dedicated in December 1927, was the first statue of Columbus erected in the South, according to The Times-Dispatch.

Native Americans have been calling for states to replace Columbus Day, which is celebrated the second Monday in October, with Indigenous Peoples’ Day. They have said that Columbus’s discovery of the New World led to the genocide of Indigenous populations in the Americas.

Mayor Levar Stoney of Richmond responded to the incident in Byrd Park on Twitter on Wednesday, saying that “the atrocities inflicted upon Indigenous people by Christopher Columbus are unconscionable.” He added that the city began celebrating Indigenous Peoples’ Day rather than Columbus Day last year.

“But the decision & action to remove a monument should be made in collaboration w/ the community,” he wrote. “Working with Richmond’s History and Culture Commission, we are establishing a process by which Richmonders can advocate for change to the figures we place on public pedestals across our city in a legal and peaceful way.”

The Richmond statue was located about two miles from the city’s Monument Avenue, where statues of the Confederate generals J.E.B. Stuart, Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee were marked last week.



On June 4, Gov. Ralph S. Northam of Virginia announced plans to remove the Lee statue, which is on state land. Members of the Richmond City Council this week unanimously voiced their support to remove four other Confederate statues from Monument Avenue, a move that had long been debated but had found renewed support as the recent protests have continued.

Many other Confederate monuments across the country have also become targets in recent weeks, with protesters damaging and toppling statues from their bases.

In Norfolk, Va., on May 30, protesters climbed a 15-foot figure of a Confederate soldier and spray-painted its base. In Charleston, S.C., “BLM,” for Black Lives Matter, and “Traitors” were spray-painted in red on the base of the Confederate Defenders of Charleston statue. In North Carolina, a Confederate monument at the State Capitol in Raleigh was marked with a black “X.”

The mayor of Birmingham, Ala., also ordered the removal of a Confederate statue from a public park last week.

"Amid Riots and a Pandemic, Church Attendance Resumes in ‘a Very Broken World’","SACRAMENTO — With their most vulnerable members at home, their community in the streets, and their nation wracked by a pandemic, riots and political polarization, Pastor Samuel Rodriguez’s congregation went to church here on Sunday, at times violating state health rules in the interest of unity.

“Outside the confines of these walls we hear the sound of a very broken world,” preached Mr. Rodriguez, an evangelical minister. “Outside these corridors of worship we hear the sound of desperation. Throughout America today we hear the sounds of a nation torn apart by the devil of racism.”

In an auditorium in a part of town that had erupted over the weekend in response to the death of a black man in police custody in Minnesota, roughly 100 black, white and Hispanic members of the New Season church raised sanitized hands toward heaven. “Yes!” they shouted. “Amen!”

As nationwide protests against the police killing of George Floyd entered their sixth day, the terror of death by coronavirus intersected on Sunday with rage over a different disease — police killings of African-American people — settling, for many, the question over when to emerge from America’s long national quarantine.

In communities across the country, many congregations that had sequestered for months in fear of catching or spreading the lethal coronavirus ventured forth at a social distance in search of comfort.

More than half of the states have continued to allow religious gatherings, but many churches, synagogues and mosques, for safety’s sake, have chosen for months to make do with Zoom sermons and livestreams. Many stuck to remote services on Sunday, but a significant number returned to public worship driven by a combination of pain, prayer and political expression.

In Pennsylvania, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia resumed public Mass, but with churches restricted to half-occupancy, and every other pew empty. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints resumed some in-person services in Alaska, Georgia, Louisiana, Illinois, Utah and a number of other locations, but chose not to reopen temples in Nevada, Hawaii, Washington and other states.

In California, at least a dozen evangelical churches made a coordinated return timed to Pentecost, a day of Christian jubilation that many regard as the church’s birthday. Some in that group were also seeking to pressure the state’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, into dropping a 100-person cap on church attendance and other rules enacted to curb the pandemic as the state’s coronavirus case count soared past 100,000, with 4,000 deaths. Several significant outbreaks started in churches.

The state’s right to restrict church attendance during the crisis was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court late Friday.

“Obviously we’re disappointed with the court’s ruling,” said Pastor Jim Domen, the founder of Church United, a group that had mobilized more than 1,500 pastors against California’s emergency restrictions. “But we report to a higher authority.”

In Fresno, 350 congregants registered to attend a socially distanced service at Cornerstone Church, whose pastor earlier in the week had compared Mr. Newsom to Soviet leaders who had propped up the Berlin Wall.

But at the Water of Life Community Church in Fontana, where some 320 people had reserved tickets for a return on Sunday, Pastor Dan Carroll said on a livestream that the church was reconsidering its plan, and had decided “to try to comply and pray that he changes his mind in the next two weeks,” referring to Mr. Newsom. The sanctuary did open, but only about 100 people per service were allowed to enter.

In Sacramento, Mr. Rodriguez and his members sang mostly without masks, in violation of state directives, but turned away some worshipers, trying to keep the crowd under 100. His point, he said, was not to criticize the governor, but to stand with his church.

Robert H. Tyler, the lawyer representing the churches and pastors who signed the petition, cited growing rates of anxiety and depression, as well as the national unrest, as a justification for not complying with the Supreme Court decision.

“Let’s give an outlet for people to meet in churches as an alternative to shutting down freeways and burning down buildings,” the statement said.

In Sacramento, still raw from the 2018 police killing of Stephon Clark, an unarmed young black man, the return to worship was set against multiple social flash points.

Pastor Rodriguez said New Season had been planning to return from quarantine on Sunday for several weeks. His motives were not as political as those of some ministers, he said — he delivered one of the prayers at President Trump’s inauguration, but likes to say that his parishioners “worship the lamb, not the elephant or the donkey.”

But he also disapproved of Mr. Newsom’s church guidelines, saying the cap on attendance was punitive for a 1,000-seat church like his. Also punitive, he said, was the state’s ban on church singing, a precaution against the airborne spread of the virus.

Then came the national fury at Mr. Floyd’s death.

On the day before New Season’s service, nearly 1,000 demonstrators wielding Black Lives Matter signs converged on California’s state Capitol. As night fell, crowds swarmed the freeways and the Sacramento Kings’ glistening sports arena, defacing a landmark sculpture by the artist Jeff Koons and looting nearby department stores.

The pain was especially sharp at New Season, where the congregation is 40 percent black, 40 percent white and 20 percent Hispanic. Patricia Littlejohn, a church volunteer, said she had sought to tune out the violence, but that it had evoked painful memories of Mr. Clark’s shooting. Coming on top of the pandemic, which cost her job at a health club, she said the unrest left her feeling isolated.

Gesturing to her fellow congregants, who were trying not to hug even as other volunteers entreated them to keep seven feet of space between them, Ms. Littlejohn smiled. “This,” she said, “means everything.”

In the front row, Mercedes Ray, a member of the church board, said the explosion of violence compelled churches to act. “What has happened out there is that people feel backed into a corner. They feel they’re not being heard and that nothing has been done.”

That concern echoed with particular force among African-American churchgoers, at the epicenter both of the fury over Mr. Floyd’s death and of the toll of the coronavirus. Out of caution, many African-American churches held services with pastors preaching to empty sanctuaries and virtual congregations — even on a day when they would have wanted to be together most.

“I think the church has to help make sure it is a wake-up call,” said the Rev. Dr. W. Franklyn Richardson, the senior pastor at Grace Baptist Church in Mount Vernon, N.Y., who kept his parish online Sunday.

“The church has had to be a safety net for a society that has ignored the community,” he said. “It’s like you pull back the covers and saw all the years of inequity and, to some degree, racist disregard for African-Americans and people of color.”

Among California’s evangelical establishment, not everyone was ready to risk returning.

The Rev. Rick Warren, whose Orange County-based Saddleback Church serves some 30,000 members at 20 locations, told congregants in an emailed video message this week that “Saddleback is going to be patient and wait for better conditions before resuming our large public gatherings.”

On this Sunday, however, even the online prayers resonated.

“What a shame it would be,” the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II of the North Carolina-based civil rights group Repairers of the Breach said in his streamed sermon, “if this nation could watch a policeman murder another human being and then pose like a hunter with his prey while his colleagues looked on — and there not be protests, there not be anger, there not be tears, there not be a diversity of people willing to say this is not right.”

“Hear me, America,” Dr. Barber added. “The lethal violence of these racist officers and others is only one manifestation of the systemic racism that is choking the life out of the American democracy.”

For many, what Americans do next matters much more than their ability to sit together in person in full church pews.

“I’ve talked with lots of black friends and pastors who are altering between rage and tears all the time,” said the Rev. Dr. Terri Hord Owens, who leads the Christian Church, also known as the Disciples of Christ, which has some 3,000 congregations in the United States.

“The exhaustion that you feel as a black person in the United States is overwhelming and continues,” she said. “No matter what we say, no matter what we even do, this stuff keeps happening.”

Dr. Owens is the first African-American (and second woman) to lead a denomination whose membership is about 80 percent white. She said her mission now, as black churches mobilize, was to make sure that white churches joined them.

Her church, like other mainline Protestant denominations, has taken progressive stances on social justice causes. But she said their efforts had to venture beyond academic discussions about racial inequality and institutional change.

“The white church in America is going to have to get serious,” Dr. Owens said. “We’re good at gathering and mourning, but we’ve got to turn to action now, and black folks can’t do it alone.”

Officer Charged With Murder in Rayshard Brooks Killing,"[Here’s what you need to know about the death of Rayshard Brooks.]

A former Atlanta police officer was charged on Wednesday with murder and aggravated assault in the fatal shooting of Rayshard Brooks outside a fast-food restaurant, another violent encounter between a black man and white officers captured on video that has inflamed national tensions over race and policing.

The shooting took place on Friday night after the police were called to a Wendy’s restaurant where Mr. Brooks, 27, had fallen asleep in his car in the drive-through. Paul L. Howard Jr., the Fulton County district attorney, said at a news conference on Wednesday that “Mr. Brooks never presented himself as a threat.”

The officer who killed Mr. Brooks, Garrett Rolfe, faces 11 charges, with prosecutors saying that he shot Mr. Brooks twice in the back and then kicked him as he was lying on the ground. Prosecutors said Mr. Rolfe also declared, “I got him,” after firing the shots.

If convicted of the murder charge, he could face life in prison or the death penalty.

transcript

On Friday night, June 12, an employee at a Wendy’s restaurant in South Atlanta calls 911. A 27-year-old man named Rayshard Brooks had fallen asleep in his car in the drive-through lane. Soon, two police officers respond. They and Mr. Brooks speak calmly and cordially for 41 minutes. “That was it.” But then in just 45 seconds, one of the officers fatally shoots Mr. Brooks as he is running away. [gunshots] How could a routine police response go so suddenly and horribly wrong? The Times examined witness videos, security footage, police body-cam and dash-cam videos. We synchronized and slowed down those videos so we can see and hear what unfolded. We reviewed police records, and procedures, and statements made by the officers involved. And we identified the critical moments and missteps that led to a young man losing his life. It’s 10:41 p.m., eight minutes after the 911 call when Officer Devin Brosnan arrives at Wendy’s. He raps on Brooks’s car window and wakes him up. Brooks appears groggy and disoriented. [beeping] Brosnan, who joined the Atlanta Police Department last year, talks to Brooks and then requests an officer who can perform sobriety tests. At 10:55 p.m., Officer Garrett Rolfe arrives. [beeping] Rolfe joined the Atlanta Police Force in 2013, and is an experienced D.U.I. investigator. Rolfe has once been reprimanded for firing his service weapon, police records show. He takes charge of the investigation. Rolfe begins to question Brooks, who is confused about where he is. He seems to think he’s six miles down the road near a Home Lodge Hotel. There’s another Wendy’s right beside it. At 11:02 p.m., Rolfe asks Brooks to get out of the car. Moments later, Brooks will also consent to a series of sobriety tests. Brooks is clearly inebriated. But he’s compliant and friendly throughout this time. The officers are courteous. And Rolfe gives him clear and precise instructions. When Rolfe now asks Brooks if he’ll take a breathalyzer test, Brooks hesitates at first. Brooks offers to go to his sister’s house. Why did Brooks want to resolve his situation without being arrested? According to court records, he was on probation for domestic violence and theft offenses. He was probably aware that a new arrest or conviction would almost certainly send him back to prison. The breathalyzer returns a blood alcohol reading of .108 percent, above the legal limit of .08 percent. Rolfe has little option now but to charge Brooks with D.U.I. Some policing experts told us he could have written a citation and drove Brooks home. Others said police are expected to show zero tolerance with drunken driving. For 41 minutes, Brooks and the officers have spoken calmly and respectfully. They even shared a few laughs. Now, Rolfe moves to arrest Brooks. And in 45 seconds, he will fatally shoot him. [gunshots] [yelling] Let’s watch this back, and break down what happens. Rolfe has signaled or sought Brooks’s consent for every action to this point. But he moves to handcuff Brooks swiftly and without clearly telling him he’s under arrest. This breaches D.U.I. arrest procedures. Brooks resists, and the three tumble to the ground. Brosnan draws his Taser … … and pushes it into Brooks’s leg. Brooks grabs the Taser. Both officers’ body cameras fall to the ground. Brooks stands up and strikes Rolfe with an open hand. As Rolfe draws his Taser, Brooks fires a dart, hitting Brosnan’s arm. Rolfe fires the Taser twice … [yelling] … and hits Brooks’s body. We hear Rolfe using his Taser as he chases Brooks. This is a breach of police procedures. Rolfe passes the Taser to his left hand and reaches for his gun. Brooks looks behind and fires the Taser he’s holding. We confirmed these Taser models with the Atlanta Police. Once they’re fired twice, they must be reloaded. So at this point, Brooks is unarmed. Rolfe drops his Taser, draws his handgun and fires three times at Brooks, who is 18 feet away and is trying to escape in a busy Wendy’s parking lot. [gunshots] Two bullets hit Brooks in the back, one piercing his heart. A third bullet hits this Chevrolet Trailblazer, which had three passengers in it. This photo from the Fulton County District Attorney shows the bullet hole. No one in the car was injured. Rolfe shouts at Brooks … ... and appears to kick him on the ground. This image, also provided by the Fulton County D.A., shows that moment more clearly. Officer Brosnan approaches and briefly stands on Brooks’s shoulder. [yelling] Meanwhile, witnesses denounce the shooting. The officers stand over Brooks for about a minute before Rolfe runs back to his vehicle to get his medical kit. Brosnan continues to stand by. It’s over two minutes before Brooks receives medical assistance. “Every fucking time!” Rolfe administers CPR until emergency services take over. At 11:39 p.m., 15 minutes after he’s shot, an ambulance takes Rayshard Brooks to a hospital where he is later announced dead. Was Rolfe justified in shooting a man holding a Taser, and who was trying to escape? Police procedures on the use of deadly force state that an officer must reasonably believe the suspect possesses a deadly weapon, and that the suspect poses an immediate threat of serious bodily injury to the officer or others. In a statement made through his lawyer, Officer Rolfe said he did use reasonable force because he “heard a sound like a gunshot” and fearing for his safety and the safety of others, he “fired” his weapon. The description of a gunshot doesn’t square with what Rolfe told investigating police at the scene. And minutes before this, Rolfe appears to have been aware that Brooks fired the Taser twice. This and other evidence will be scrutinized in what has now become a homicide investigation. Rolfe has been charged on 11 counts, including felony murder, and both officers with aggravated assault.

Another officer involved in the confrontation, Devin Brosnan, was charged with three counts, Mr. Howard said, including aggravated assault and violations of oath for stepping on Mr. Brooks’s shoulder while he was lying on the ground and also failing to render aid.

Mr. Howard said Officer Brosnan, who was placed on administrative leave by the Police Department after the shooting, is cooperating with prosecutors in the investigation.

L. Chris Stewart, a lawyer who is representing the Brooks family, praised Officer Brosnan for his cooperation, saying he provided new details on the events that led to Mr. Brooks’s death on Friday night.

“Even in dark times like this, you have to try and see the light, and the positivity of this situation is the courageousness of Officer Brosnan to step forward and say what happened was wrong,” Mr. Stewart said. “It is officers like that who change policing.”

The law office representing Officer Brosnan issued a statement Wednesday saying that although he was cooperating with the prosecutors, he had not agreed to testify against Mr. Rolfe or to plead guilty to any charges.

“This was not a rush to judgment. This was a rush to misjudgment,” the firm, Garland, Samuel & Loeb, said in its statement.

Within 24 hours of the shooting, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta said on Saturday that she did not believe it was justified, and Mr. Rolfe had been fired. The city’s police chief, Erika Shields, also resigned. But as protesters swarmed the streets with renewed intensity, including torching the Wendy’s, the demands to also bring criminal charges against the officers swelled.

“This isn’t like a celebration or a victory lap of watching these officers get charged. Nobody’s happy, nobody’s celebrating — because this never should have happened. We shouldn’t have to celebrate as African-Americans when we get a piece of justice like today. We shouldn’t have to celebrate and parade when an officer is held accountable for actions that we saw, and actions that we didn’t know about until today. Some people thought that we’d be happy and be celebrating and have a fist in the air, but it’s more of disappointment that this is the state of policing and this is where we’re at.” “I can’t imagine being there — because I don’t know what I would have done if I would have seen it for myself. But I felt everything that he felt, just by hearing what he went through. And it hurt — it hurt really bad.”

An unusually high number of Atlanta police officers called out and did not show up to work their shifts on Wednesday evening, a department spokesman said, hours after a recently fired officer was charged with murder and aggravated assault in the fatal shooting of Rayshard Brooks.

But the spokesman, Sgt. John Chafee, denied rumors circulating on social media and among protesters in the city that officers had walked off the job after the charges were announced.

Sergeant Chafee did not immediately confirm how many officers had called out Wednesday. But he said the department had enough officers on the job to maintain operations and respond to calls throughout the city, despite the absences.

Officials from the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, the union representing Atlanta Police Department officers, denounced the charges filed Wednesday against Garrett Rolfe, who shot Mr. Brooks at a Wendy’s parking lot in Atlanta on Friday, and against Officer Devin Brosnan. The union said the charges were premature and politically motivated.

Mr. Rolfe, who was fired the day after the shooting, faces 11 criminal charges in the case, including murder. Officer Brosnan was charged with three counts, including aggravated assault; he has been placed on administrative duty. 

Appearing on Fox News on Wednesday, President Trump defended Garrett Rolfe, the former Atlanta police officer who has been charged with murder in the fatal shooting of Rayshard Brooks.

“You can’t resist a police officer, and if you have a disagreement, you have to take it up after the fact,” Mr. Trump told the Fox host Sean Hannity. “It was out of control — the whole situation was out of control,” the president added.

Mr. Trump said that police officers in America are under siege and that Mr. Rolfe’s fate is now in the hands of the courts.

“It’s up to justice right now,” he said. “It’s going to be up to justice. I hope he gets a fair shake. Because police have not been treated fairly in our country. But again, you can’t resist a police officer like that.”

Earlier Wednesday, Mr. Trump said in an interview with the Sinclair Broadcast Group that the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who has not played since 2016 after kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality, should get a chance at another job in the N.F.L.

“I would love to see him get another shot, but obviously he has to be able to play well,” Mr. Trump said.

The president has repeatedly criticized Mr. Kaepernick and other players for kneeling, urging N.F.L owners in 2017 to fire any players who protested during the national anthem.

A Seattle-area labor coalition voted on Wednesday night to oust the city’s police union from its ranks, as pressure continued to build around the country to reform or defund police departments and stop the misconduct of some officers.

The coalition, the King County Labor Council, had warned the union, the Seattle Police Officers Guild, in recent weeks that it could face expulsion if it did not address systemic racism in its ranks. The police guild had responded with a vow to discuss the issue, but members of the council voted to move forward with removal.

Police unions have become the focus of ire in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a black man, at the hands of a white police officer in Minneapolis. Police labor leaders have long led efforts to defend their members and resist proposed reforms.

Amid the anti-racism demonstrations that have rolled across the nation for weeks, Seattle activists have kept up pressure on city officials and the Police Department, with protesters establishing a zone over several city blocks as a home base for gatherings. On Wednesday night, some of those protesters once again shut down Interstate 5.

Five years to the day after the massacre at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., one of the nation’s oldest black churches, the city, like much of the United States, is wrestling anew with its legacy of slavery and racial discrimination.

The shooting at Mother Emanuel, as the church is known, left nine dead, shocked the country and ignited a reckoning over racism and racist violence. The gunman was a white supremacist who had posed with the Confederate battle flag, and the shooting led to the removal of the flag from the grounds of the South Carolina State House and a broader effort to remove Confederate symbols throughout the South and elsewhere.

Now, national protests against police brutality, incited by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month, have spurred renewed scrutiny of the historical figures whose statues adorn public spaces and a movement to purge those who espoused racist views or participated in slavery or the violent colonization of North America.

In Charleston, the focus has turned to a statue of John C. Calhoun, a South Carolinian who served as vice president from 1825 to 1832 and was a fierce defender of slavery. Mayor John J. Tecklenburg said in a news conference on Wednesday, flanked by members of the City Council, that he was bringing a resolution to the council that would remove the statute from Marion Square in the heart of Charleston.

The resolutions calls for it to be relocated to a museum or educational facility where it could be displayed in a less prominent way with added context. Mr. Tecklenburg, standing at the base of the statue, said the intention was “not to erase our long and often tragic history but to begin a new and more equitable chapter of that history.”

The announcement came as the city is remembering the nine African-Americans, ages 26 to 87, who were killed at Mother Emanuel on June 17, 2015.

On Wednesday evening, the church will post on its Facebook page and YouTube channel a video tribute to the victims by family members and survivors. On Sunday there will be a march remembering the “Emanuel Nine,” as well as Mr. Floyd and Walter Scott, an unarmed black motorist who was killed by a white police officer in North Charleston two months before the attack at Mother Emanuel. Next Wednesday, the church will host a prayer vigil on its steps.

A 2019 report by the Southern Poverty Law Center found that while 114 Confederate symbols had been removed since the shooting at Mother Emanuel, 1,747 still stood.

Some of those have come down or been damaged by protesters in recent days, including a statue of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, in Richmond, Va., and a Confederate obelisk in Birmingham, Ala.

On Tuesday night, another Confederate statue in Richmond, known as Richmond Howitzers Monument, which commemorated a Civil War artillery unit, was toppled by protesters from its pedestal, according to The Richmond Times-Dispatch, becoming one of the latest symbols to fall.

Aunt Jemima, the syrup and pancake mix brand, will change its name and image amid an ongoing backlash, with its parent company Quaker Oats acknowledging that the brand’s origins are “based on a racial stereotype.”

The brand, founded in 1889, is built on images of a black female character that have often been criticized as offensive. Even after going through several redesigns — pearl earrings and a lace collar were added in 1989 — Aunt Jemima was still seen by many as a symbol of slavery.

On Wednesday, Quaker Oats, which is owned by PepsiCo, said that it was taking “a hard look at our portfolio of brands” as it worked “to make progress toward racial equality through several initiatives.”

The packaging changes, which were first reported by NBC, will begin to appear toward the end of this year, with the name change coming soon after.

“While work has been done over the years to update the brand in a manner intended to be appropriate and respectful, we realize those changes are not enough,” said Kristin Kroepfl, Quaker’s chief marketing officer, in a statement.

Amid nationwide protests over racism and police brutality in recent weeks, many companies rushed to express their solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement, often running into accusations of hypocrisy. But PepsiCo was already familiar with the fallout — in 2017, it apologized for running an ad featuring Kendall Jenner, a white model, that was criticized for trivializing the movement.

PepsiCo bought Quaker Oats in 2001, inheriting the Aunt Jemima brand. Ramon Laguarta, the chief executive of PepsiCo, wrote in a piece in Fortune this week that “the journey for racial equality has long been part of our company’s DNA.”

Within hours of the announcement that Aunt Jemima was being retired from store shelves, at least two more food companies rushed to respond to complaints about other brands that have been criticized for using racial stereotypes.

Mars Food, the owner of the brand Uncle Ben’s rice, which features an older black man smiling on the box, said on Wednesday afternoon that it would “evolve” the brand as protests over racism and police brutality across the country continued.

Shortly after that announcement, ConAgra Brands, the maker of Mrs. Butterworth’s pancake syrup, released a statement saying the company had begun a “complete brand and package review.” Critics have long associated the shape of the Mrs. Butterworth’s bottle with the mammy, a caricature of black women as subservient to white people.

One protester said a police officer used a baton to pin him by his neck against a squad car. Another said she was tackled by an officer who then drove his knee into her back so hard she could not breathe.

A third — a registered nurse — was tending to a young man with a head wound, but claimed the police would not allow an ambulance to drive through a crowd to fetch him. A fourth described rushing through a line of police with batons to help a sobbing teenage girl, then escaping with her just before an officer tried to grab them.

“It felt,” she said, “like warfare.”

These and other troubling accounts emerged on Tuesday at the first public hearing held by state officials investigating New York Police Department’s handling of protests stemming from the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police in Minneapolis last month.

The inquiry is being led by the state attorney general, Letitia James, and comes as city officials and some district attorneys in New York are also examining how the police have dealt with what is now more than three straight weeks of demonstrations.

At the beginning of the hearing, Ms. James said that she and her investigators had already received hundreds of tips about possible police misconduct at the protests and had lined up so many witnesses that testimony would last all day on Tuesday and would continue Wednesday morning.

The hearing marked the first time that individual demonstrators told their stories to the public, and some became emotional, erupting into tears or fits of rage.

The officers showed no mercy, no humanity and tortured my brother to death in the middle of the street in Minneapolis with a crowd of witnesses watching and begging them to stop showing us black people the same lesson yet again: Black lives do not matter in the United States of America. When people raise their voices to protest the treatment of black people in America they are silenced. They are shot and killed. My brother George Floyd is one of the many black men and women that have been murdered by police in recent years. The sad truth is that the case is not unique. The way you saw my brother tortured and murdered on camera is the way black people are treated by police in America. You watched my brother die. That could have been me. I am my brother’s keeper. You in the United Nations are your brothers’ and sisters’ keepers in America. And you have the power to help us get justice for my brother George Floyd. I’m asking you to help him. I’m asking you to help me. I’m asking you to help us, black people in America. I hope that you would consider establishing an independent commission of inquiry to investigate police killings of black people in America, and the violence used against peaceful protesters.

In an extraordinary session of the United Nations Human Rights Council on Wednesday, George Floyd’s brother made an urgent plea for the world body to create an independent commission to study the killing of black people by the police in the United States.

“You watched my brother die,” Philonise Floyd told the council via video. “That could have been me. I am my brother’s keeper. You in the U.N. are your brothers’ and sisters’ keepers in America, and you have the power to help us get justice for my brother George Floyd.”

“I am asking you to help me,” he said. “I am asking you to help us, black people in America.”

The meeting of the council in Geneva was called by Burkina Faso, on behalf of 54 African countries. The council’s president, Elisabeth Tichy-Fisslberger, said the issue did not just pertain to the United States, but it was the unrest that followed the death of George Floyd in policy custody on May 25 that galvanized a global movement to address systemic racism and abuse of power by the police.

“This is a topic that is not about just one country, it goes well beyond that,” Ms. Tichy-Fisslberger said in a statement before the hearing. “When I said it’s not against the United States, I mean there are complaints about a lot of racism in many countries of this world, of course in Europe, but not only; you find it all over the world.”

Philonise Floyd also made an emotional plea to American lawmakers last week, asking members of the House Judiciary Committee to “stop the pain” and pass reforms that make officers accountable for brutality.

The Boy Scouts of America said this week that it would create a “diversity and inclusion” merit badge and make earning it a requirement for becoming an Eagle Scout, the highest scouting rank. It joined a growing number of organizations that are announcing public support for racial equality and the Black Lives Matter movement.

The Texas-based organization, which was formed in 1910 and reports more than 2.2 million youth members, has frequently been criticized for a lack of inclusivity in recent years.

In a statement on Monday from its executive committee, the Boy Scouts said the group would make diversity and inclusion training mandatory for its staff, starting July 1, and that it would work with local councils to ensure that property names, events and other insignia do not bear “symbols of oppression.”

Effie Delimarkos, a spokeswoman for the Boy Scouts, said the organization was still working on the details of how a scout would earn the diversity and inclusion merit badge. The development of a new badge typically takes years, but she said the timeline would be expedited in this case.

The organization said in the statement that it would incorporate elements from existing badges that “require scouts to learn about and engage with other groups and cultures to increase understanding and spur positive action.”

The Boy Scouts initially put out a much broader statement on June 3, with no mention of race, and focusing instead on teaching scouts “to become the best versions of themselves.”

Dwayne Fontenette Jr., 29, an Eagle Scout who also has volunteered as a scout leader, helped write a letter last week, signed by more than 500 scouts, calling for the Boy Scouts to take a stronger stance against “anti-black racism.” Mr. Fontenette, who is black, said in an interview that he was moved by the organization’s statement this week.

“It represented for me the first time in my scouting history where I feel like the organization saw me, and valued me completely,” he said.

“The George Floyd incident certainly accelerated this conversation, and we find ourselves at a place with a package that I think speaks to the families that I spoke with yesterday who lost loved ones. We hear you. I think this package speaks very clearly to the young person whose concerned when he’s stopped by the law enforcement officers. We see you. Too often we’re having a discussion in this nation about, are you supporting the law enforcement community or are you supporting communities of color. This is a false binary choice. This legislation encompasses that spirit. It speaks to the fact that we believe that the overwhelming number of officers in this nation are good people, working hard, trying to keep order in the communities.” “Even before George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, Senator Scott has made it possible for those of us in the Senate Republican Conference who are not African-American to understand that this problem still exists. We learned about his being stopped on numerous occasions well before the events of this year. But the witnessing of the murder of George Floyd and the experience in my hometown of Breonna Taylor certainly brings to the forefront this issue for all Americans, including Senate Republicans. And our Democratic friends, if they want to make a law, and not just try to make a point, I hope they’ll join us in getting on the bill.”

Senate Republicans on Wednesday morning unveiled their answer to Democrats’ sprawling policing legislation, proposing a narrow set of changes to law enforcement that would place new restrictions on the use of chokeholds, impose penalties for the failure to wear body cameras, and make lynching a federal crime.

The measure was spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the Senate’s only African-American Republican, who has become increasingly focused on matters of race in recent years and has led the effort to bring his party together around a proposal to answer a growing public movement to address systemic racism in policing that has placed Republicans on the defensive.

Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, announced that the Senate would take up the bill next week, a swift timeline that reflected a sense of the urgency for action.

“The witnessing of the murder of George Floyd, and the experience in my hometown of Breonna Taylor certainly brings to the forefront this issue for all Americans, including Senate Republicans,” Mr. McConnell told reporters. “I want you to know that we’re serious about making a law here.”

But the limited reach of the legislation reflects the challenge facing Republicans. While they have scrambled to show their willingness to move on policing changes for the first time in years, they are unwilling to accept the far-reaching federal measures that civil rights activists say are necessary to confront systemic bias in policing.

Democrats will push their own legislation through the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, advancing an expansive bill that would place an outright ban on chokeholds, change the qualified immunity doctrine that shields police officers from lawsuits, and make it easier to identify, track and prosecute police misconduct.

The debate in the committee that began in the morning reflected the wide gulf between the parties on the issue. While Democrats took turns demanding action to address systemic racism in policing, Republicans charged that Democrats merely wanted to defund police departments, something that their bill does not do.

Representative Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, said he believed the legislation included “provisions that will have a net negative impact on communities that are most affected by crime and on the safety of officers who put their lives on the line to serve them.”

When given the chance to offer their own proposals, House Republicans proposed one that would require the F.B.I. and other federal law enforcement officials to record interviews, saying the measure was needed because of what they considered to be injustices in the investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia.

A Virginia sheriff has apologized to a black pastor who was arrested earlier this month after calling 911 to report that a group of white people were trespassing on his property and taunting him with racial slurs.

The pastor, Leon K. McCray, 61, called the authorities during the confrontation, which began when he saw two people hauling a refrigerator to the rubbish bin at the apartment building he owns in Edinburg, Va., on June 1.

Mr. McCray, who declined to comment when reached by phone, told WUSA-TV that the two people became angry when he asked them to leave the property. They quickly returned, he said, with three friends, who were also white. Mr. McCray said that the five people surrounded him and began using racial slurs, and that one head-butted him while another shoved him from behind.

Mr. McCray told WUSA that he pulled out his gun and “pointed it down to the ground in hopes that they would back off.” Then he called 911. Deputies from the Shenandoah County Sheriff’s Office arrived and arrested Mr. McCray, who was charged with brandishing a firearm, a misdemeanor.

The Shenandoah County sheriff, Timothy C. Carter, issued a statement late last week in which he said he had spoken with Mr. McCray on June 3, two days after the incident, and apologized. He said the five people who confronted Mr. McCray had been taken into custody on various charges, including hate crimes.

In an interview on Wednesday, Sheriff Carter said he had ordered an internal review into the incident. More broadly, he said his department was taking a look at its own conduct and policies in light of the national unrest over police brutality that followed the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

“We’re learning a lot from our involvement in this incident, and we’re trying to learn and be better as we move through this,” he said.

Seattle Mayor Defies Trump,"This briefing has ended.

Seattle’s mayor on Thursday defended the city’s decision to allow protesters to declare an “autonomous zone” on the city’s streets, pushing back a day after President Trump threatened to send federal resources to crack down on the protesters, whom he labeled terrorists.

The mayor, Jenny Durkan, said it was the people’s right to challenge authority and their government. 

“It’s not terrorism. It’s patriotism,” she said, adding, “We do not need anyone, including the president, to try to sow further divide, further mistrust and misinformation.”

Mr. Trump’s ire focused on the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood, where protesters and police officers had repeatedly clashed next to a police station in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. 

Seattle officials decided this week to withdraw from the area and boarded up the police building, leaving protesters to claim the streets and declare an autonomous zone.

With the tacit blessing of the city, including the fire chief helping to install portable toilets, protesters have held community meetings and speeches while sharing free food and painting “black lives matter” on the street. 

Ms. Durkan said city officials have been communicating with demonstrators in the zone and will continue to find ways for them to protest peacefully, while also making sure people can get in and out of the neighborhood.

Late Wednesday and again on Thursday, Mr. Trump criticized the decision of city and state officials on Twitter. “Take back your city NOW,” Mr. Trump wrote in a tweet directed at Ms. Durkan and Gov. Jay Inslee. “If you don’t do it, I will.” He added, “Domestic Terrorists have taken over Seattle.”

Ms. Durkan responded with a tweet of her own: “Make us all safe. Go back to your bunker.”

Carmen Best, the police chief, said in a video message on Thursday that the decision to leave the police station was not hers and that she was angry about how it developed. She also shared, without evidence, concerns about problems in the area, such as businesses being asked to pay money in exchange for protection.

Ms. Best said later in the day that nobody had made a formal report and that those issues were just circulating on places like social media. The Capitol Hill Business Alliance said it had been reaching out to businesses in the area and found no reports of any such problems.

The actions of these officers, the deplorable lack of responsibility to do their job at a time when the city and their fellow officers needed them most — their conduct will confirm the perception that too many people on the South and the West Side were left to fend for themselves. You’re not serving or protecting when you make movie popcorn and put up your feet and lounge while your fellow officers are down the street getting the hell beaten out of them. If you sleep during a riot, what do you do on a regular shift when there’s no riot? What are you doing when there’s no crisis? And what makes you comfortable enough that supervisors won’t hold you accountable? That means sergeants, lieutenants, commanders, chiefs, deputy chiefs need to step up or step out.

Chicago police officers lounged, napped and made themselves coffee and popcorn inside the campaign office of Representative Bobby Rush, Democrat of Illinois, while looting, arson and other crimes were in progress nearby, Mr. Rush said on Thursday. 

At a news conference in Chicago, Mr. Rush said he discovered what had happened when he reviewed a video recorded two weeks ago by a security camera in his office. He checked the video, he said, after being alerted that his office had been burglarized. 

Mr. Rush said he saw on security footage “eight or more police officers lounging in my office as looters were breaking into stores in the shopping center where my offices are located.” 

Mr. Rush appeared alongside Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago, who displayed still images from the video. 

“They had their feet up on the desk,” Mr. Rush said. “One was asleep on my couch in my campaign office. One had his head down on the desk. One was on his cellphone. They even had the unmitigated gall to go and make coffee for themselves and pop popcorn — my popcorn, in my microwave — while looters were tearing apart businesses within their sight, within their reach.”

In an interview, Mr. Rush said the officers were in his office for about four hours, and left behind a $1 bill. “They insulted me by leaving a dollar on the table,” he said. “It made me feel totally disrespected as a member of Congress and an African-American male.”

“These officers exemplified an I-don’t-give-a-damn attitude,” he added. 

Mayor Lightfoot called the incident a “personal embarrassment” and pledged to hold the officers accountable. It “shocked me, shocked my team and frankly enraged us,” she said. “These individuals were lounging in a congressman’s office, having a little hangout for themselves, while small businesses on the South Side were looted and burned.” 

Superintendent David Brown of the Chicago Police personally apologized to Mr. Rush at the news conference over the episode.

As senior leaders, everything you do will be closely watched, and I am not immune. As many of you saw the result of the photograph of me at Lafayette Square last week, that sparked a national debate about the role of the military in civil society. I should not have been there. My presence in that moment, and in that environment, created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics. As a commissioned uniformed officer, it was a mistake that I have learned from and I sincerely hope we all can learn from it. We who wear the cloth of our nation come from the people of our nation, and we must hold dear the principle of an apolitical military that is so deeply rooted in the very essence of our republic.

The country’s top military official apologized on Thursday for taking part in President Trump’s walk across Lafayette Square for a photo op after authorities used tear gas and rubber bullets to clear the area near the White House of peaceful protesters.

“I should not have been there,” Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a prerecorded video commencement address to National Defense University, reports Helene Cooper. “My presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics.”

His first public remarks since Mr. Trump’s photo op, in which federal authorities attacked peaceful protesters so that the president could hold up a Bible in front of St. John’s Church, are certain to anger the White House. Mr. Trump has spent the days since the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis taking increasingly tougher stances against the growing movement for change across the country.

On Wednesday, the president picked another fight with the military, slapping down the Pentagon for considering renaming Army bases named after Confederate officers who fought against the Union in the Civil War.

The back and forth between Mr. Trump and the Pentagon in recent days is evidence of the deepest civil-military divide since the Vietnam War — except this time, military leaders, after halting steps in the beginning, are now positioning themselves firmly with those calling for change.

Mr. Trump’s walk across Lafayette Square, current and former military leaders say, has sparked a critical moment of reckoning in the military.

“As a commissioned uniformed officer, it was a mistake that I have learned from,” General Milley said. He said he had been angry about “the senseless and brutal killing of George Floyd,” and repeated his opposition to Mr. Trump’s suggestions that federal troops be deployed nationwide to quell protests.

General Milley’s friends said that for the past 10 days, he had been agonized about appearing — in the combat fatigues he wears every day to work — behind Mr. Trump during the walk across Lafayette Square, an act that critics said gave a stamp of military approval to the hard-line tactics used to clear the protesters.

The general believed that he was accompanying Mr. Trump and his entourage to review National Guard troops and other law enforcement personnel outside Lafayette Square, Defense Department officials said.

The Pentagon will review the National Guard’s response to protests that took place around the country after the killing of George Floyd in police custody, Defense Department officials said in a statement on Thursday. 

The decision comes after a series of episodes, including the shooting in May of a Louisville, Ky., restaurant owner and the dangerous low-level flyovers of protesters last week in Washington.

The review, led by the Army secretary, Ryan McCarthy, will examine “training, equipping, organizing, manning, deployment and employment of National Guard forces,” the statement said. It will “specifically evaluate the National Guard’s efforts working with local and federal law enforcement across the country during the last two weeks.”

The District of Columbia National Guard’s response, bolstered by thousands of troops from a dozen states, was fraught with issues, a New York Times report revealed. Guard leaders issued ad hoc orders and carried out aggressive tactics, spurred by Pentagon officials’ desperate attempt to avoid President Trump’s demands for active-duty troops in American cities.

The D.C. Guard, unlike other National Guard forces, reports directly to the president through the Army and defense secretaries. The review is expected to be submitted to Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper by the end of July.

“In recent weeks, the National Guard has performed professionally and capably in support of law enforcement in cities across the United States,” Mr. Esper said in the statement announcing the review. 

Nationwide, the Guard’s response involved more than 20,000 troops in 28 states as well as the District of Columbia.

“The people united will never be defeated! The people united ...” “No justice —” “No peace!” (cheers) “Whoa, run, run, run, run!” “Whoa!” “Let go, let him go!” “Let him go!” “Back up.” “Get back.” “Get back.” “Black lives matter! Black lives matter!” “Put our blood on the streets — there’s blood on the streets for over 400 years! Put the blood on the street!” (cheering) “Whose streets?” “Our streets!” “We’re out here to support our young. Our young is the leader of this — we are the background!”

Protesters marching from Harlem to Midtown Manhattan on Thursday afternoon left drips of red paint and red handprints on the pavement along the way, to symbolize “blood on the streets,” as they called for an end to brutality and racism in the criminal justice system.

Police officers accompanying the march were jeered when they arrested a protester after he spray-painted “BLM,” for Black Lives Matter, on a street sign near the Metropolitan Museum of Art. As the police restrained him, the protester, a young black man, told the crowd that tagging the sign “felt really, really good.” Onlookers shouted, “Black art matters!”

The march began with about 100 people at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 110th Street, where volunteers distributed snacks, energy drinks, face masks and hand sanitizer. It grew as it moved downtown, and so did the police presence, with officers on foot, on bicycles and in vans. In front of Trump Tower, police barricades forced the marchers out of the avenue and onto the sidewalk. 

“We are marching for justice! We are marching for justice for black lives!” Shelby Brown, one of the leaders of the march, told the racially diverse crowd at the outset. As they marched, the protesters chanted the names of black people killed in encounters with the police.

Even Dr. King’s assassination did not have the worldwide impact that George Floyd’s death did. Because just like television changed the civil rights movement for the better when they saw Bull Connor’s dogs ripping the clothes off of elderly black women going to church, and firehoses ripping the skin off of young kids — that, all those folks around the country who didn’t have any black populations heard about this but they didn’t believe it — but they saw it. So my point is that I think people are really realizing that this is a battle for the soul of America. Who are we? What do we want to be? How do we see ourselves? What do we think we should be? Character is on the ballot here. That’s what this is about.

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said on Thursday that the killing of George Floyd in police custody had a larger effect globally than the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968.

“Even Dr. King’s assassination did not have the worldwide impact that George Floyd’s death did,” Mr. Biden said at a roundtable event in Philadelphia.

Mr. Biden noted that “television changed the civil rights movement for the better,” and added that the prevalence of cellphones today had “changed the way everybody’s looking at this.”

“Look at the millions of people marching around the world,” Mr. Biden said. “So my point is that I think people are really realizing that this is a battle for the soul of America. Who are we? What do we want to be? How do we see ourselves? What do we think we should be? Character is on the ballot here.”

Mr. Biden met with Mr. Floyd’s family in Houston earlier this week and recorded a video message for his funeral. He has called for “real police reform” and has emphasized the need to address systemic racism in society. 

The Louisville Metro Council on Thursday unanimously voted to ban “no-knock” warrants, a controversial procedure that the city’s police force used during the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor in March. 

Mayor Greg Fischer said on Twitter that he would sign the ban into law.

The measure, known as Breonna’s Law, also sets new guidelines for other types of search warrants, according to a statement from the council. It requires that police officers have their body cameras on when conducting a search.

“A few weeks ago, the community began to cry out for justice and change,” said Councilwoman Barbara Saxton Smith, a primary sponsor of the ordinance. “You spoke, we listened, and tonight we took action.” 

Ms. Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician, was killed by the police during a late-night drug investigation after three officers used a no-knock warrant to enter her apartment without warning. Her boyfriend, who later said he thought someone was breaking into the apartment, shot an officer in the leg. The officers shot Ms. Taylor eight times; they have not been charged despite widespread protests calling for their arrests.

“All she wanted to do was save lives,” Ms. Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer, said after the ordinance was passed. “With this law, she’ll get to continue to do that. She would be so happy.”

Instead, we have to go the opposite way. We must invest more energy and resources in police training and recruiting and community engagement. We have to respect our police. We have to take care of our police. They’re protecting us. And if they’re allowed to do their job, they’ll do a great job. And you always have a bad apple — no matter where you go, you have bad apples. There are not too many of them. And I can tell you, there are not too many of them in the police department. We all know a lot of members of the police. Americans are good and virtuous people. We have to work together to confront bigotry and prejudice wherever they appear. But we’ll make no progress and heal no wounds by falsely labeling tens of millions of decent Americans as racists or bigots. We have to get everybody together. We have to be in the same, same path — I think faster. If we don’t do that, we have problems. And we’ll do that.

President Trump strongly defended the nation’s police in Dallas on Thursday, and sharply rejected far-reaching proposals to tackle racial injustice and police brutality in the United States. 

At a roundtable meeting he convened in a Dallas church, Mr. Trump said that in response to the killing of George Floyd, he was working on an executive order to encourage police departments to adopt the latest professional standards in dealing with the public. 

He mentioned de-escalation tactics and pilot programs for social workers to collaborate more closely with police officers, but beyond that he was vague about what the order might include, and spent most of his time criticizing those who have called for broader changes, like defunding the police.

“Instead, we have to go the opposite way,” Mr. Trump said. “We must invest more energy and resources in police training and recruiting and community engagement. We have to respect our police, we have to take care of our police, they’re protecting us, and if they’re allowed to do their job, they’ll do a great job.

“You always have a bad apple, no matter where you go — you have bad apples,” he continued. “There are not too many of them, and I can tell you, there are not too many of them in the police department.”

While he called the killing of Mr. Floyd in police custody “a disgrace,” he referred to it only in passing, and instead castigated critics who have said that American law enforcement is riddled with systemic racism that needs to be addressed.

“We have to work together to confront bigotry and prejudice wherever they appear, but we’ll make no progress and heal no wounds by falsely labeling tens of millions of decent Americans as racists or bigots,” Mr. Trump said. “We have to get everybody together. We have to be in the same path.”

Accompanying Mr. Trump on his trip to Dallas were Attorney General William P. Barr and two of the few prominent members of his administration who are black — Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, and Vice Adm. Jerome Adams, the surgeon general.

Mr. Trump met with police union leaders and religious leaders, but according to The Dallas Morning News, he did not invite any of the three top law enforcement officials in Dallas — the police chief, sheriff and district attorney, all of whom are African American. He did invite an African-American police chief from the small town of Glenn Heights, south of Dallas.

Mayor London Breed of San Francisco said on Thursday that the city’s Police Department would gradually move away from responding to calls that do not involve criminal activity. 

The move, which a spokesman for the mayor described as one that would take years to put into effect, would “limit unnecessary confrontation” between police officers and the community, the mayor’s office said in a statement.

“We need to move past the situation where the police are the first to respond to everything,” said Jeff Cretan, the mayor’s spokesman. He said the goal was for other agencies to handle non-criminal calls involving homeless people or those suffering from mental health problems or drug addiction.

The notion of reducing the broad spectrum of police duties is an area of common ground between protesters calling to defund the police and many police departments.

Other cities have also been looking at the duties performed by police officers. On Sunday, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said the police in his city would no longer handle the enforcement of street vendors. 

In San Francisco, Ms. Breed also announced that the police would be barred from using any military-grade weapons against unarmed civilians, including “chemical weapons such as tear gas, bayonets and tanks.”

When peaceful protests have turned violent, who has been causing the worst trouble?

F.B.I. agents and federal prosecutors have pursued charges aggressively against rioters, looters and others accused of wreaking havoc during the demonstrations, including conspiracy to commit arson, starting a riot, civil disorder and possession of an improvised firebomb.

But despite cries from President Trump and others in his administration, none of the people charged with serious federal crimes stemming from the unrest have so far been linked to the loose collective of anti-fascist activists known as antifa.

A review of the arrests of dozens of people on federal charges reveals no known effort by antifa to mount any coordinated campaign of violence. Some criminal complaints said the suspects had vague anti-government political leanings. But most of the violent acts that have taken place at protests have been attributed by federal prosecutors to people with no affiliation to any group. 

Likewise, interviews with several major local police departments and a review of hundreds of newspaper articles about arrests around the country reveal no evidence of any organized political effort behind the looting and other violence. 

“We saw no organized effort of antifa here in Los Angeles,” said Josh Rubenstein, the spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department. 

And the chief of police in Minneapolis, Medaria Arradondo, said in an interview, “As I sit here today, I have not received any sort of official information identifying any of the groups.”

Experts on extremism said the few suspects with overt political goals who have been arrested on serious charges have links not to antifa, but to “accelerationist” groups that hope to exploit any public unrest to further their own anti-government goals.

It’s good. OK, well, my take is you throw. Oh, please no me. Give me a hand. I will please give me. Here you go. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did you find it.

A video released this week by the Oklahoma City Police shows the 2019 arrest of a black man, who is seen pinned on the ground saying “I can’t breathe,” to which an officer replies, “I don’t care.” The man died in custody shortly afterward.

Officers arrested the man, Derrick Scott, 42, on May 20, 2019, after receiving reports that someone was brandishing a firearm, Capt. Larry Withrow said at a news conference on Tuesday. He added that Mr. Scott had a loaded gun in his pocket.

A medical examiner’s report from last year lists Mr. Scott’s probable cause of death as a collapsed right lung, and cites physical restraint, recent methamphetamine use, heart disease and emphysema as contributing factors. The manner of death is “unknown,” it says.

Video of the arrest, recorded by police officers’ body cameras, was released this week after Mr. Scott’s family and a local Black Lives Matter group demanded more details about his death.

The video showed officers confronting Mr. Scott in a parking lot. In the recording, Mr. Scott can be seen starting to run from the officers. A male officer tackles Mr. Scott, after which Mr. Scott can be heard gasping, “I can’t breathe,” and the officer replies, “I don’t care.” After the officers restrain Mr. Scott’s hands, they roll him onto his side, into what Captain Withrow called a “recovery position.”

Several minutes later, an ambulance arrives. Mr. Scott can be heard crying and being told to “quit fighting.” As he is lifted toward a stretcher, he jumps up, kicks outward and then falls again. Later, in the ambulance, body camera footage shows one of the officers performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him. Mr. Scott was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Captain Withrow said that investigations conducted by the Police Department and district attorney’s office showed there was “no indication of any wrongdoing.” He also said that “once they had any indication that there was any medical distress, they called for medical assistance immediately.”

Asked about the officer who replied “I don’t care” to Mr. Scott, Captain Withrow said: “During the heat of a conflict like that, certainly that may be something an officer says. Just understand the officers are fighting with someone at that point.”

He added, “It’s not uncommon for people, when you’re struggling with them, when you’re trying to get them into control, to say ‘I can’t breathe.’ You hear that frequently.” 

Protesters toppled a statue of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War, in Richmond, Va., on Wednesday night, as demonstrators across the country continued to target symbols of white supremacy after the death of George Floyd.

The statue was among a number of prominent Confederate monuments that had stood on Monument Avenue in Richmond, which was once the capital of the Confederacy. Local news reports showed photographs of it lying on the street, with the police nearby before a tow truck carted it away.

It came down one week after Mayor Levar Stoney of Richmond said he would propose an ordinance to remove all four Confederate monuments the city controls along Monument Avenue. Mr. Stoney said he would introduce the bill on July 1, when a new state law goes into effect giving local governments the authority to remove the monuments on their own.

“Richmond is no longer the capital of the Confederacy — it is filled with diversity and love for all — and we need to demonstrate that,” Mr. Stoney said in a statement then.

Protesters in Portsmouth, Va., about 80 miles away, knocked the heads off the statues of four Confederates on Wednesday night and pulled one of the statues to the ground after the City Council postponed a decision on moving that monument, The Associated Press reported.

A protester was hit in the head by the falling monument and was hospitalized with what the police said were life-threatening injuries, the news agency reported.

Across the country, at least 10 monuments to Confederates or other controversial historical figures have been removed, and people have challenged similar monuments in more than 20 cities.

In Houston, Mayor Sylvester Turner said on Thursday that the city would remove two Confederate statues from public parks.

Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City also waded into the resurgent national debate over the legacy of the Civil War on Thursday morning, when he called on military officials to rename a street at an Army base in Brooklyn named after Robert E. Lee.

“His name should be taken off everything in America, period,” Mr. de Blasio said at a news briefing.

In a sign of how widely the mythology of the pre-Civil War South is being reconsidered, the country music group Lady Antebellum announced on Thursday that it was changing its name to Lady A, because it had belatedly come to appreciate that the word antebellum — meaning before the war — evoked slavery and racism, and not merely a quaint architectural style. 

Protesters have increasingly targeted statues of Christopher Columbus, whose expeditions to the Americas led to the colonization and genocide of Indigenous people and helped initiate the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Columbus statues were pulled down this week outside the state Capitol in St. Paul, Minn., beheaded in Boston’s North End neighborhood and doused with red paint in Houston.

Several protesters vandalized the statues of Columbus and Juan Ponce de León in downtown Miami on Wednesday evening, using red spray paint to tag them with, among other things, clenched fists, George Floyd’s name, and a hammer and sickle. The Miami Police Department said it had arrested several suspects, identified via surveillance cameras.

Carol L. Folt, president of the University of Southern California, said Thursday that the university had removed from campus the name and bust of its fifth president, Rufus Von KleinSmid, a psychologist who promoted eugenics.

Mr. Rufus Von KleinSmid, whose tenure spanned the Great Depression and Second World War, died in 1964. 

“He expanded research, academic programs, and curriculum in international relations,” Ms. Folt said in a public letter to the university. But, she added, “he was also an active supporter of eugenics, and his writings on the subject are at direct odds with U.S.C.’s multicultural community and our mission of diversity and inclusion.”

A Republican-led Senate committee voted behind closed doors on Wednesday to require the Pentagon to rename military bases and other assets named after Confederate officers and generals within three years, just as President Trump publicly declared he would not tolerate such a move.

The Senate Armed Services Committee approved adding the measure to its annual defense authorization bill, according to lawmakers who were present.

The endorsement of the proposal, from Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, came as the White House said the president would go so far as to veto the sweeping defense legislation if Congress tried to force his hand on the issue. 

Inclusion of the provision raises the prospect of an election-year Senate vote on whether to honor Confederate military personnel amid a national outcry against historical symbols of racism that has gained extraordinary speed, fueled by protests of police brutality against black Americans.

“I never thought I would get a chance to go back in time to vote against the Confederacy,” Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, tweeted on Wednesday, “but ok.”

It also came on a day when Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California called for the removal of 11 statues of Confederate soldiers — including Jefferson Davis and Alexander Stephens, the president and vice president of the Confederate States of America — from display in the Capitol. 

“The statues in the Capitol should embody our highest ideals as Americans, expressing who we are and who we aspire to be as a nation,” Ms. Pelosi said. “Monuments to men who advocated cruelty and barbarism to achieve such a plainly racist end are a grotesque affront to these ideals. Their statues pay homage to hate, not heritage.”

Those statues were selected and donated by states to the Capitol as a way to honor the nation’s leaders, but a bipartisan congressional panel has the authority to direct the Capitol’s architect to remove them from display.

On Thursday afternoon, even as many Republicans on Capitol Hill said they were open to removing statues from the Capitol and renaming bases honoring Confederate figures, Mr. Trump exhorted them on Twitter to “not fall for this” and reject the moves.

California’s Reckoning With Racism Continues,"Good morning.

After a weekend of protests, state and federal officials said on Monday they would monitor the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department’s investigation into the death of Robert Fuller, a black man who was found hanging from a tree near Palmdale City Hall. Local authorities said his death was most likely a suicide — a determination quickly disputed by family members.

According to The Victorville Daily Press, state officials are also working with the local authorities to investigate the death of Malcolm Harsch, a black man who was also found hanging from a tree, in Victorville. Family members are worried his death will also be called a suicide.

“It doesn’t sound right,” Mr. Harsch’s sister, Harmonie Harsch, told my colleague on Sunday.

[Read the latest updates on race and policing across the country.]

Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced his office would get involved in the probe into Mr. Fuller’s death during a virtual news conference in which he called for broad police reforms.

In Los Angeles, Black Lives Matter activists laid out in a presentation before the City Council why promises of reform here are insufficient.

And Gov. Gavin Newsom found himself defending the state’s reopening amid concerns that case counts rise.

“You have to recognize you can’t be in a permanent state where people are locked away,” he said.

The debate over how and whether to allow businesses to reopen has hinged in part on racial inequity; the virus is disproportionately sickening and killing black and Latino Californians. Those who work in low-paid service jobs are at particular risk.

The University of California’s Board of Regents unanimously voted to support restoring affirmative action in the state. California voters in 1996 passed Proposition 209, which changed the state’s constitution to ban affirmative action at state institutions. As CalMatters reported, reversing it would allow state schools to factor in prospective students’ race, ethnicity, gender and national origin in the admissions process.

And after thousands marched through Hollywood and West Hollywood to support black transgender people and to draw attention to violence against members of the black L.G.B.T.Q. community, the Supreme Court on Monday issued a ruling that the 1964 Civil Rights Act protects gay and transgender people from discrimination at work.

The columnist Erika D. Smith wrote in a Los Angeles Times opinion piece that while the ruling was a positive development, it also highlighted how different the pace of change has been for the L.G.B.T.Q. community and how far there is to go for black Americans.

Last week, my colleague Marie Tae McDermott asked college graduates about how they’re facing a bleak economy and an unsettled world. Here’s her dispatch after talking with some of them:

If the former students I talked to have one thing in common, it’s that they are all waiting — waiting for job offers, for acceptance letters and for things to return to normal.

“It feels like with everything else going on, graduation is an afterthought. Which is ironic, because I’ve always imagined graduation would be one of my most important life events,” said Louisa Nickerson.

Ms. Nickerson, 22, graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and will start a master’s program in the fall.

On Saturday, Ms. Nickerson said she had plans to exchange speeches with her roommates and to parade across their front lawn in caps and gowns.

“The canceled ceremony is the thing I feel most upset about. My mom passed away two years ago so the idea of walking across the stage as a way to honor her and commemorate my resilience was really important to me,” she said.

Graduate school is also in the works for Heidi Warde, 22, who graduated from the University of San Francisco. Ms. Warde’s school also opted to postpone its in-person commencement and she said the experience had been “both anticlimactic and disheartening.”

“Facing uncertain job prospects, I am thankful to know that I have coursework on the horizon, and am just trying to put off student loan worries,” she said.

Emiliano Gomez, 21, graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles, and while he doesn’t particularly like graduation ceremonies, he would have liked to attend his own.

“I was looking forward to sitting in the temperate L.A. sun, in the Sunken Gardens, where I practiced handstands and walked my friend’s dog, for my English department graduation,” he said.

He’s still applying for jobs from his parents’ home in Marysville. He said a law firm in San Francisco went from scheduling an interview for April to saying, “Give us a call after you graduate and we’ll see.”

Kaiya Collins, 22, is now at home in Sacramento after leaving her student teaching program in Spokane, Wash., early because of the outbreak. The pandemic has thrown a wrench in her long-term plans.

“I am worried that this situation has left me ill prepared for my first year teaching,” she said. “I also feel like I never received any real closure on my time at school. I did not get to say a real goodbye to my friends or visit my favorite places in Spokane before I left.”

Ms. Collins, who graduated from Gonzaga University, was awarded a Fulbright grant to teach English in Taiwan, but she isn’t sure when she will be able to leave. The program, which is funded by the State Department, was postponed until January 2021 and there’s a chance that it might even be canceled.

“The uncertainty of it all is making it hard to plan for my future,” she said. As a credentialed teacher, she cannot find a job that will end in January. If the travel ban is extended and her Fulbright grant canceled, she is without a job for the school year.

Christian Fong, 22, who graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, said, “I think I have suppressed much of my feelings about graduating and have not properly processed many of my emotions.”

He has goals, he said, like moving to Washington, D.C., with his girlfriend, but he is content to keep busy applying for jobs and studying for the LSAT.

The pandemic has affected his worldview, but he remains optimistic.

“I think it is time to rethink what can and cannot be achieved,” he said. “If we can solve this pandemic, I think we can solve a lot of the world’s other problems, too.”

Protests Reach Political Ads,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Nick Corasaniti, your host on Tuesdays for our coverage of all things media and messaging.

They are among the most searing, iconic images in a generation: streets flooded blocks deep with protesters marching, fists raised in solidarity. A cry for racial justice denied, stirred by the killing of George Floyd in police custody.

Unsurprisingly, the protests are quickly becoming political fodder in an election year marked by a president more apt to harness division than heal it. 

On Facebook, the protests have been the center of an enormous advertising surge by Joe Biden’s campaign, which has poured more than $5.2 million into the platform in recent days, including $1.6 million on Thursday alone — more than triple President Trump’s single-day record, as our colleague Shane Goldmacher reported.

One Biden ad, backed by more than $900,000, proclaimed that Mr. Trump “fans the flames of white supremacy and hatred in our country.” It was set against a few different images, including a black-and-white photo of Mr. Trump striding past security officers in riot gear after they cleared peaceful protesters near the White House so he could have a photograph taken outside a church. Other images showed protesters with signs declaring “Black Lives Matter” just below the dome of the United States Capitol.

In total, Mr. Biden’s campaign has spent roughly $2 million on Facebook ads that mention Mr. Trump and white supremacy, according to Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm. The ads are almost always accompanied by scenes from the protests around the country.

The Trump campaign is taking the opposite tack, spending about $120,000 on ads that denounce “riots.” The ads include unsubstantiated assertions that far-left activist groups are responsible for rioting in American cities.

“Dangerous MOBS of far-left groups are running through our streets and causing absolute mayhem,” reads one Trump ad on Facebook.

The campaign is spending about $40,000 to promote various iterations of the ad using that language, but none of them use any images from the protests. Instead, they use photographs of the president or big text saying “Stop Antifa,” a loose movement that has not been shown to be orchestrating violence or looting.

The messaging coming from the Biden and Trump campaigns has been mirrored by allies and down-ballot campaigns across Facebook. Liberal organizations like MoveOn have interspersed images of protesters and Mr. Floyd, while the re-election campaign of Senator Mitch McConnell attacked “looting, riots, and destruction” alongside a photograph of the senator speaking.

On television, the chaotic scene of protesters being gassed near the White House runs in the middle of a new ad from Priorities USA, one of the biggest Democratic super PACs, with a narrator proclaiming, “As Americans stand up for justice, Donald Trump divides and inflames.” The ad began airing on Monday and is being rotated into the group’s multimillion-dollar ad buy in battleground states.

The same scene was repeated in a new ad from the Lincoln Project, a super PAC supported by Republicans critical of Mr. Trump. That ad began airing over the weekend and includes a picture of Mr. Trump holding up a Bible outside St. John’s Church as a narrator calls the president a “coward.”

In the hotly contested Democratic Senate primary in Georgia — see the results from today’s voting here — Jon Ossoff, the former House candidate who was leading in the polls, went with a different visual approach and addressed the killing of Ahmaud Arbery. He spent $420,000 on an ad where he speaks to the camera for the entire 30 seconds, saying it’s the “worst kind of corruption” when “a young black man in Georgia is shot dead in the street, but police and prosecutors looked the other way.” There are no scenes of protests, or any other cutaway during the ad.

The protest movement may be only a few weeks old, but expect to see many more ads featuring the demonstrations, and the reaction to them, in the coming weeks and months.

The visage of this well-known, two-term Republican president is fairly rare in modern political ads. But a new ad from the Lincoln Project, a super PAC run by Republicans critical of President Trump, seeks to use the staid leadership style of former President Dwight D. Eisenhower to undercut Mr. Trump’s management of the coronavirus outbreak and the mass protests against racial injustice.

Citing a speech Eisenhower had written while supreme Allied commander in World War II — a speech in case the invasion of Normandy was unsuccessful — the ad says great leaders “hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.”

The message: The ad spends more than 40 seconds praising Eisenhower for taking responsibility in a crisis, ending with a quotation from the speech: “If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine alone.” The ad then cuts to Mr. Trump being asked about his administration’s disbanding of the White House’s pandemic team before the outbreak. The president offers a curt, “I didn’t do it.”

Using scenes of protests and a hospital bed to depict the new crises facing the country, the ad closes in on Mr. Trump saying, “No, I don’t take responsibility at all.”

The takeaway: Run by a group of former Republican political operatives, the Lincoln Project takes pains to never advocate on behalf of Joe Biden. Rather, in appeals seemingly targeted to other Republican voters, the group highlights Republican icons and ideals in an attempt to paint Mr. Trump as their opposite.

Here, the juxtaposition is stark, but whether it can erode support for Mr. Trump in a party where he is overwhelmingly popular remains to be seen.

Why Aren’t Face Shields More Popular in California?,"Good morning.

(This article is part of the California Today newsletter. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox.)

Last week, we introduced our ongoing series, Your Lead, where we answer readers’ questions about how the pandemic is changing daily life in California.

Today we are tackling our first question: Why have face shields not yet caught on as an alternative to masks in California?

Lori Holt, a neuropsychologist in Encino, posed this question. Dr. Holt conducts in-office assessments on patients using plexiglass barriers, air purifiers and disinfectants to protect herself and her patients from Covid-19. However, her efforts to conduct an accurate assessment are often stymied by patients who come in wearing masks.

“One of the thorniest issues we had to overcome involved the use of face coverings,” she wrote in an email.

Dr. Holt evaluates patients using a battery of tests to gauge things like a patient’s memory, attention and language. Face masks can sometimes muffle speech, posing communication challenges and potentially affecting the patient’s comprehension of the tests.

“If the patient doesn’t fully understand even a word or two of a paragraph or a word list that I’m asking them to remember for a verbal memory test, the entire test is ‘spoiled’ and unusable,” she said.

Dr. Holt has found that clear plastic face shields are a good alternative to masks for her patients, who can opt to wear their own masks or are given their own face shields that they can take home afterward.

“It is much easier to test the patients when they wear the face shield,” she said. “Their speech is much more intelligible than when they wear a mask. Also, we can see the patient’s face and thus do not lose critical data with respect to facial expression that can help us understand the patient’s emotional state of mind.”

Dr. Holt wondered about the popularity of face shields because, she said, despite the shield casting a minor glare, it is so comfortable that she sometimes forgets to take it off at the end of the day.

John Anderson, who lives in Penn Valley, Calif., asked a similar question about face shields. Mr. Anderson is hearing-impaired and prefers that others use face shields so that he can read lips. During a recent health checkup, his doctor wore a mask and his wife wore a face shield. He read his wife’s lips as she repeated the doctor’s words.

Last week, Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered all Californians to wear face coverings, like cloth masks, when out in public. The state’s Department of Public Health recommends wearing a plastic face shield with a cloth draped along the bottom only if the wearer has a medical condition that prevents them from wearing a cloth mask.

Face shields are also commonly used by front-line health workers, but more people are looking at face shields as an added layer of protection.

The Palo Alto Unified teachers’ union requested that the district supply teachers with face shields and other personal protective equipment when they return to school. And the state’s Department of Education recommends that everyone on school campuses wear masks or face shields with a drape across the bottom when schools reopen.

My colleague Knvul Sheikh wrote about the use of face shields, which can be easily wiped down and reused. Face shields also have the benefit of stopping people from touching their faces, and can be easier and more comfortable than masks.

However, experts say face shields have limits to the amount of protection they can offer. They seem to be most effective in protecting against cough droplets for people in close range of one another. And droplets can seep in through the back and sides of a face shield, which is why draping a piece of cloth along the bottom is recommended. But their efficacy has not yet been widely studied. For now, face masks are the better option for most people.

Regardless, we may be seeing a lot more of them in the coming weeks.

The City of Long Beach issued a health order last month requiring servers in restaurants to wear both cloth masks and face shields when working. Los Angeles issued a similar order this month.

Because the face shields were cost prohibitive for some businesses, Long Beach began a free distribution program for face shields that it sourced from donations and from state and city resources. Last weekend, it distributed 4,800 shields in just a few hours.

Sandy Wedgeworth, the city’s public health emergency management director, estimates that the city still had around 25,000 face shields that it planned to give away to restaurants, bars and salons in future distribution events.

“We want them out there in the community. We want the folks that need them to have them,” she said. “They are no good to anyone sitting in boxes.”

Details of Shooting in Atlanta Fuel Debate on Police Use of Force,"This briefing has ended. Follow our continuing coverage of Atlanta, Black Lives Matter and police protests here.

As details emerged of what happened when the Atlanta police shot and killed Rayshard Brooks as he fled from them outside a Wendy’s restaurant in Atlanta, political leaders drew parallels and contrasts with the other recent police-involved killings of black people that have ignited protests across the nation.

The Fulton County medical examiner’s office confirmed on Sunday that Mr. Brooks’s death was a homicide and that the cause of death was “gunshot wounds of the back.” The office’s statement said he had been hit by two shots, causing “organ injuries and blood loss.”

Representative James Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina, said on Sunday that he did not believe that lethal force was necessary in the police’s encounter with Mr. Brooks, who had dozed off at the wheel of a car while waiting on the restaurant’s drive-through line.

“They’d already patted him down, he had no weapon on him — where did they think he was going to go?” Mr. Clyburn said. “So he’s running away — my goodness, you’ve got his car, you can easily find him. But no, you fire bullets into his back.”

Appearing on the CNN program “State of the Union,” Mr. Clyburn continued, “That is not what you’d call corresponding force. And so I think the mayor is right, this did not call for lethal force.”

Stacey Abrams, the former minority leader in the Georgia House of Representatives and Democratic gubernatorial candidate, said she saw a direct link to the police-involved killings of black people that have sparked protests demanding an overhaul of policing nationwide.

“We need reformation of how police officers do their jobs, how law enforcement does its job, because what happened yesterday to Rayshard Brooks was a function of excessive force,” Ms. Abrams said Sunday on the ABC program “This Week.” “The fact that they were either embarrassed or, you know, panicked led them to murder a man who they knew only had a Taser in his hand.”

However, Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina, said on the NBC program “Meet the Press” that he did not think the case was in the same category as other recent killings by the police that have been widely regarded as clearly unjustified.

The body-camera video of the encounter, he said, “is disturbing to watch, but I’m not sure that it’s as clear as what we’ve seen around the country.”

When asked if there should be a federal standard for the use of force, Mr. Scott said it would be “difficult to establish a codified practice,” but added that an effort to find the best existing practices at departments around the country would be helpful.

He added that he wanted to see clearer policies on chokeholds, a contentious restraint method that restricts air flow. Some cities and states have declared outright bans on such tactics in recent weeks.

Representative Karen Bass, Democrat of California and chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said she saw a lot of common ground between the police and officials at all levels who support the protesters’ demands for a wholesale rethinking of law enforcement.

“You hear police say all the time, ‘Don’t put us in a position of solving society’s problems,” Ms. Bass said on “Fox News Sunday."" “Because we have not put money into social health and economic issues like homelessness and substance abuse, the police then are left to pick up the pieces. So we need to invest in a comprehensive manner.”

When Rayshard Brooks was fatally shot outside a Wendy’s restaurant on Friday night, the events were captured on video by security cameras and witnesses to the confrontation.

An analysis of the videos by The New York Times shows that Officer Garrett Rolfe fired a stun gun at Mr. Brooks as he and another officer, Devin Brosnan, tried to take Mr. Brooks into custody. Mr. Brooks got hold of Officer Brosnan’s stun gun, broke away and ran, turning at one point to fire it at Officer Rolfe, who was chasing him. Then Officer Rolfe fired three gunshots at Mr. Brooks.

The shooting left many in the city once again incensed by the death of another black man at the hands of the police — and nervous about the potential for more destructive flare-ups. By Saturday night, protesters had blocked roads and an interstate near the restaurant and had apparently set the restaurant on fire, according to news reports, with the police firing tear gas and flash grenades to try to disperse the crowd.

Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta announced on Saturday that the city’s police chief had resigned. Early on Sunday morning, Sgt. John Chafee, a spokesman for the Atlanta Police Department, said Officer Rolfe had been fired and Officer Brosnan put on administrative leave.

Police dashboard and body-camera videos show that Mr. Brooks was compliant and friendly with the officers when they first approached him and for some time after that, and the encounter turned to a struggle when the officers tried to handcuff him.

The police were called to the scene initially because Mr. Brooks had fallen asleep on the drive-through line of the restaurant. The video shows Officer Brosnan waking Mr. Brooks in the driver’s seat of a car and asking him to move the car to a parking space. Officer Brosnan appears to be unsure whether to let Mr. Brooks sleep there or to take further action.

He calls for another police officer, and Officer Rolfe arrives twelve minutes later. Officer Rolfe searches Mr. Brooks and then puts him through a sobriety test, which he fails. Mr. Brooks asks the officers if he can lock his car up under their supervision and walk to his sister’s house, which is a short distance away. “I can just go home,” he says.

Officer Rolfe asks Mr. Brooks to take a breath test for alcohol. Mr. Brooks admits he has been drinking and says, “I don’t want to refuse anything.” When the test is complete, Officer Rolfe tells Mr. Brooks he “has had too much drink to be driving,” and begins to handcuff him; only then is Mr. Brooks seen offering any resistance.

As protesters coalesce around the movement to “defund the police,” Democratic congressional leaders emphasized on Sunday that their intent was not to cut off funding for police departments, but to thoroughly overhaul them.

“Nobody is going to defund the police — we can restructure the police forces,” said Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3 House Democrat, on the CNN program “State of the Union.” “The fact of the matter is that police have a role to play.”

Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, one of the most liberal lawmakers in the House, said she supported dismantling the Minneapolis Police Department after George Floyd, a black man, died in police custody there.

“You can’t really reform a department that is rotten to the root — what you can do is rebuild,” Ms. Omar said on “State of the Union,” noting that half of homicides in Minneapolis go unsolved and that there were reports that the department had destroyed rape kits.

When pressed on whether the police department should be abolished permanently, Ms. Omar said, “Absolutely not.”

“I think that’s really where the conversation is going wrong,” she said, “because no one is saying that the community is not going to be kept safe. No one is saying that crimes will not be investigated. No one is saying that we are not going to have proper response when community members are in danger.

“What we are saying is the current infrastructure that exists as policing in our city should not exist any more,” Ms. Omar said. “And we can’t go about creating a different process with the same infrastructure in place.”

Lawmakers are wrestling with the contours of legislation to overhaul policing and how to reconcile a measure introduced in the House last week with drafts still under discussion in the Senate.

Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the lead Republican drafting the legislation in the Senate, said the measures would not get through the Republican-controlled Senate if they included provisions for limiting the qualified immunity that currently protects police officers from lawsuits over what they do on duty.

Democrats have raised similar objections to a proposal to “decertify” bad officers as a substitute for more sweeping changes.

Senator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, said he supported a national ban on chokeholds, though the legislation still being drafted in the Senate is not expected to have such a prohibition. “Absolutely, we should have that,” he said on ABC. “That was one of the things that we should have engaged in a long time ago.”

Mr. Scott also appeared on the NBC program “Meet the Press,” where he said it would be “difficult” to codify a nationwide standard for use of force by the police. Still, he said, the time when a chokehold was acceptable “had come and gone.”

Speaker: “If you need to take it, if you need to process it, you need to keep carrying it forward for every single day of your life. Because we don’t get to determine when we’re black and when we’re trans. “Black trans lives matter! Black trans lives matter! Black trans lives matter!” “And by the time we are all done, they’re gonna hide. They couldn’t even walk a mile in your shoes.”

Thousands of protesters gathered near the Brooklyn Museum on Sunday afternoon for a rally and silent march to call attention to police violence against transgender people, especially women of color.

“I demand that the state be held accountable for our murders,” Ianne Fields Stewart, founder of the Okra Project, a support and advocacy group, said at the rally. “Today I demand that the state be held accountable for continuously dead-naming us, ignoring us, abusing us, violating us, while profiting off of us in the shadows.”

Transgender people face high rates of violence around the country and the world, and the American Medical Association said last fall that killings of transgender women of color in the U.S. amounted to an epidemic.

One speaker at the rally was Melania Brown, sister of Layleen Polanco, a transgender woman who was found dead in 2019 in a cell at Rikers Island. Ms. Polanco’s death in custody attracted national attention.

Prosecutors found that prison officers were not responsible, but Ms. Polanco’s family has sued the city for wrongful death, saying that the prison staff failed to provide her with timely medical care that could have saved her life after she suffered an epileptic seizure.

In Los Angeles, L.G.B.T.Q. activists held a march and rally in Hollywood and West Hollywood on Sunday focused on racial injustice and police brutality. against members of their community, The Los Angeles Times reported.

Former Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates joined the call on Sunday to rename Army bases that honor Confederate generals, despite President Trump’s opposition, saying that it was time to rid the American military of symbols that represent “the dark side of our history.”

Mr. Gates, who was appointed defense secretary by President George W. Bush and kept on by President Barack Obama, said the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis had focused new light on a legacy of racism that should be confronted in society, including within a military that is increasingly diverse.

“The events since the killing of George Floyd present us with an opportunity where we can move forward to change those bases,” Mr. Gates said in an interview. “It’s always puzzled me that we don’t have a Fort George Washington, or a Fort Ulysses S. Grant, or a Fort Patton, or a facility named for an African-American Medal of Honor recipient. I think the time has come, and we have a real opportunity here.”

As a longtime scholar of the Soviet Union, Mr. Gates said, “I’m very sensitive to the notion of rewriting history.” But he said base names and statues of Confederate figures should not be seen as honoring them. “They belong in a museum someplace, so we’re not celebrating them, we’re learning from them and the mistakes they made,” he said.

As it happens, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia weighed in on the subject Sunday, saying on state television that the pulling down of Confederate statues and other monuments as a result of protests was “undoubtedly a destructive phenomenon.”

The Black Lives Matter movement has opened a rift among prominent Asian-Americans in Massachusetts, where members of a state commission disagreed openly about whether their community was complicit in racism against black people.

The disagreement stems from a statement issued on June 4, in which the commission described “the deep roots of anti-Blackness” among Asian-Americans, and said that Asian-Americans “continue to benefit from the ‘model minority’ myth and our historic proximity to white privilege.”

Within a few days, strong dissents began to surface around the statement, which was approved by 13 members of the 20-member commission. Since then, a number of prominent Asian-Americans have objected to the statement, including several of the seven members who did not vote.

Dean A. Tran, a Republican state senator from Fitchburg, issued a rebuttal to the statement, which he called “inflammatory.” He argued that Asian-Americans had not contributed to anti-black racism.

“My family and I were refugees from Vietnam, worked hard day and night, and kept our heads down despite encountering hatred through various forms of prejudice,” he wrote. “We, like many other Asian-Americans, certainly did not benefit from ‘white privilege.’”

He said that many Asian-Americans “are outraged that a tax-funded state agency would misrepresent the Asian-American community this way.”

The state commission was formed in 2006 to promote the well-being of what has become the fastest-growing minority community in Massachusetts.

Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina, said on Sunday that he had been in conversations with the White House about making Juneteenth, which marks the date, June 19, 1865, when enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, first learned of their freedom, a national holiday. “I think it’s a brilliant idea,” Mr. Scott, the only Republican senator who is black, said on the NBC program “Meet the Press.”

Texas was the last of the former Confederate states where enslaved people heard the news of Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, so June 19 has long been celebrated by African Americans as the date when slavery finally ended after the Civil War.

The date hit the headlines recently when President Trump’s re-election campaign scheduled his first rally since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic to be held on June 19 in Tulsa, Okla., the site of an eruption of deadly racist violence in 1921 that destroyed a thriving black business community. After the timing drew widespread criticism, the rally was rescheduled for the following day.

“My understanding is he moved the date once he understood Juneteenth,” Mr. Scott said on “Face the Nation.” “I’m not sure that the planners on his inner-circle team thought about June 19, Tulsa, Oklahoma, and race riots.”

Other Republican allies of Mr. Trump also said in interviews aired Sunday that they had expressed concerns to him about the date of the rally. “My encouragement to the president was to be able to pick a day around it,” Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma said on CNN. And Ben Carson, Mr. Trump’s housing secretary, said on the ABC program “This Week” that “it’s probably good to have moved it.”

As protests against racism and police violence have spread overseas, protesters have often added demands for a reckoning with their own nations’ histories of colonization, racism and abusive policing. Those reckonings have made headway in some places and met resistance in others.

President Emmanuel Macron of France said on Sunday that while he would stand firm against racism in his nation, he refused to accede to demands for the removal of statues or the renaming of streets honoring colonial-era figures.

“The republic will not wipe away any trace, or any name from its history,” he said. “It will not forget any of its works. It will not take down any statues.” Mr. Macron warned French citizens against a “hateful or false rewriting of the past.” and called for a fresh look at France’s relations with its former colonies in Africa.

As France faces a growing debate on racial issues, a longtime taboo in a country that, by law, does not keep statistics on the race or ethnicity of residents, Mr. Macron vowed to “be uncompromising against racism, anti-Semitism and discrimination.” On Saturday, Sibeth Ndiaye, the first black spokesman for the French government, wrote in an opinion essay that France should reconsider the use of ethnic statistics.

Mr. Macron also responded to calls to overhaul the French police. At least 15,000 people protested in Paris on Saturday against racially motivated police brutality. But Mr. Macron said that the French police “deserve the support of the public authorities and the gratitude of the nation.”

Police officers mounted their own demonstration last week against government attempts to change their practices and discipline officers suspected of racism.

A statue in Milan, Italy, of a renowned journalist who died in 2001 attracted the ire of protesters on Sunday. Protesters scrawled the Italian words for “rapist” and “racist” on the statue of Indro Montanelli, who acknowledged having had a 12-year-old Eritrean bride while he was stationed in Eritrea during Italian colonial rule in the 1930s.

How Do Californians Feel About Governor Newsom?,"Good morning.

(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)

Demonstrators gathered in cities across the state for a ninth night to protest racism and police brutality on the same day that officials in Minnesota announced new charges for the Minneapolis officers in the death of George Floyd.

In Oakland, protesters defied a curfew they said was intended to silence them, while in Los Angeles, a weekly Black Lives Matter gathering swelled to thousands.

[Read about the new charges here.]

All this makes it feel strange to think that just about a week ago, Californians were carefully tracking a complicated, fraught process for reopening restaurants, stores, salons and other businesses that make up the lifeblood of the state’s economy.

[Read about California’s reopening process here.]

And not long before that, as the realities of the pandemic became more clear, pollsters with the nonprofit Public Policy Institute of California were taking the public’s temperature on the state and federal government’s response to the crisis in the institute’s most recent statewide survey.

Mark Baldassare, the organization’s president and chief executive, told me that the results show the depth of the psychological impact of the crisis; almost half of Californians say the worst is yet to come in the pandemic — but that number is much higher, 69 percent, among African-Americans, who have been disproportionately hurt both by the virus itself and economically in the crisis.

Still, almost six in 10 Californians are more worried about the state reopening too quickly, rather than not quickly enough.

“People continue to put their faith in state leadership around the Covid crisis,” Mr. Baldassare said.

That extends to Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose approval rating increased to 65 percent of adults from 53 percent in February.

President Trump’s approval rating, on the other hand, has stayed the same, 35 percent among adults, from February to May. And the ratings have been consistently divided along party lines.

That his handling of the coronavirus crisis hasn’t affected his ratings at all, Mr. Baldassare said, suggests that political polarization is deeply rooted.

“You could look at Donald Trump’s ratings before the impeachment,” he said. “There is nothing to date that has moved his base.”

Mr. Newsom, on the other hand, could be benefiting from a “rally around the flag,” phenomenon — but it’s a boost that may not last.

“The things that tend to make people disapprove of their governor is what our governor will be dealing with in the next few months,” Mr. Baldassare said. “State budget problems.”

And there are going to be a lot of them. Right now, the state’s $54.3 billion anticipated shortfall still feels abstract, Mr. Baldassare said. But as cuts to programs and services become real, Californians will almost certainly lay some blame at Mr. Newsom’s feet.

The survey showed that Californians have a dim view of both the state and national economies right now, amid huge job losses, Mr. Baldassare said.

But he added that one reason the protests over the past week had gained such broad, multicultural support is that many Californians across race and geography are frustrated with economic inequality.

That, coupled with what the survey found was overwhelming support for the state’s vote-by-mail expansion ahead of November, could point to a major mobilization of voters inspired by the protests to get more involved with local or state races.

“It will be people who are very upset about the status quo getting the chance to have their voice heard not just about the president or Congress,” Mr. Baldassare said.

It’s officially Pride month. Of course, celebrations can’t look like they have in the past because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Global Pride will be online, organizers have announced, as will San Francisco Pride and San Diego Pride.

But as has been broadly noted over the past week, Pride celebrations commemorate Stonewall, an uprising against discrimination led by people of color like Marsha P. Johnson, the black transgender advocate and performer.

And so the nonprofit that produces the LA Pride Parade announced on Wednesday that it would once again host an in-person event — but this one would be a protest march in solidarity with the black community. It’ll be on Sunday, June 14.

“It is our moral imperative to honor the legacy of Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, who bravely led the Stonewall uprising, by standing in solidarity with the Black community against systemic racism,” said Estevan Montemayor, president of the board of directors for the organization, Christopher Street West, in a statement.

The organization has asked participants to wear face coverings.

Sharpton Delivers Eulogy,"transcript

[singing] “George Floyd, lovingly known as ‘Big Floyd’ and the ‘Gentle Giant,’ was steadfast in his kindness and devotion to helping his fellow Jack Yates Lions succeed through his genuine example of love, faith and generosity.” “The world knows George Floyd. I know Perry Jr. — he was a pesky little rascal, but we all loved him. And I just want to thank all the mothers that are here today. And if you’ve got a nephew, an uncle, just hug them and just let them know we are for all these young black men that are coming up in this world today. And just hug them and love them because we don’t ever know.” Singing: “The good times that made us laugh, outweigh the bad.” “Your children will be honored to witness your contributions firsthand. You didn’t make excuses, but stood tall and accepted your responsibilities like a real man.” “We must commit to this family — all of his family, all five of his children, grandchildren and all — that until these people pay for what they did, that we’re going to be there with them. Because lives like George will not matter until somebody pays the cost for taking their lives. The problem is too many of you been walking by the Eric Garners, been walking by the Trayvon Martins, been walking by the Arberys, been walking by — and now we stopped for George Floyd. And I’m in Houston today because I don’t want nobody to call me a passer-by.”

More than two weeks after George Floyd gasped under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer that he could not breathe — an embodiment of the suffocation long felt by black Americans — the mayor of Houston stood at his funeral on Tuesday and announced that he would ban the city’s police from using chokeholds or strangleholds.

“We honor him today because when he took his last breath, the rest of us will now be able to breathe,” Mayor Sylvester Turner of Houston said during a final service for Mr. Floyd, 46, who grew up in Houston’s predominantly black Third Ward. 

An order by the mayor would also require the police to give a warning before shooting, among other measures.

The announcement underscored just how quickly the death of Mr. Floyd, a black man who was held down for nearly nine minutes by a white police officer, has gripped and transformed the nation, spurring hundreds of protests and significant policy changes. 

Calls to ban neck restraints and take funding away from the police have spread well beyond the site of his death in Minneapolis, where city officials have vowed to dismantle the Police Department and start over.

The City Council in Washington outlawed police chokeholds on Tuesday, and the police in Phoenix also announced an end to another kind of neck restraint. Mr. Floyd’s brother is scheduled to testify at a congressional hearing on Wednesday.

The sweeping changes came as Mr. Floyd, a father and security guard, was laid to rest in a final goodbye that capped days of public grief and national unrest. As Mr. Floyd’s coffin was wheeled out of the church by pallbearers on Tuesday afternoon, to be buried in a grave next to his mother, a crowd of mourners erupted in grief and calls for justice.

“We will breathe!” one man shouted. Another yelled, “Get your knee off our neck!” Two rows of police officers stood to the side. 

As the coffin was lifted into the hearse, a chant broke out: “Say his name! George Floyd! Say his name! George Floyd!”

The death of Mr. Floyd led to two weeks of protests in hundreds of cities across the United States, although many had quieted by Tuesday.

In Portland, Ore., a federal judge issued an order on Tuesday night restricting how the city can use tear gas, saying there was evidence that officers had violated the rights of peaceful protesters. The judge said the use of tear gas should be limited to situations in which lives or safety are at risk, even if that means officers are unable to stop some property damage. The order lasts for 14 days.

A New Jersey corrections officer was suspended and a FedEx employee was fired on Tuesday after re-enacting the killing of George Floyd on the sidelines of a march protesting racism and police violence.

The march on Monday passed through Franklinville, N.J., south of Philadelphia. It was met by a small group of counterprotesters, including the two men who performed the re-enactment.

“If you don’t comply, that’s what happens,” one man can be heard yelling in a video posted on social media as he presses his knee down on the other man’s neck. A third man yells: “Black lives matter — to no one.”

The re-enactment took place next to a pickup truck covered with an American flag and two large banners that said “TRUMP” and “ALL LIVES MATTER.”

In a statement on Tuesday, Chief Brian Zimmer of the Franklin Township Police Department said that town officials were “appalled and saddened by the revolting actions of certain individuals” and that an investigation had been launched.

A spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Corrections said the corrections officer had been suspended, and a FedEx spokeswoman, Davina Cole, said the “individual involved” was no longer employed by the company.

“FedEx holds its team members to a high standard of personal conduct, and we do not tolerate the kind of appalling and offensive behavior depicted in this video,” Ms. Cole said in a statement, adding, “we stand with those who support justice and equality.”

George Perry Floyd Jr. was born in North Carolina but grew up in the Cuney Homes housing complex in Houston. He was a 1993 graduate of Jack Yates High School, where he played on the basketball team as a 6-foot-6 power forward “able to dunk with both hands.” And he was a father of five and grandfather of two, according to the program for Tuesday’s funeral.

His relatives referred to him as “Superman.”

“The world knows George Floyd,” said Kathleen McGee, one of his aunts, surrounded by relatives, all dressed in white. “I know him as Perry Jr. He was a pesky little rascal, but we all loved him.”

Like the funerals of Michael Brown and Eric Garner in 2014, Mr. Floyd’s funeral on Tuesday became a moment of both national reckoning and mourning, as black leaders and Mr. Floyd’s family celebrated his life and denounced the brutality of his death. The funeral aired live on broadcast and cable television, and speaker after speaker invoked the political moment born out of Mr. Floyd’s death.

“No child should have to ask the question that too many black children have had to ask for generations: ‘Why? Why is Daddy gone?’” former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said in a video message. “When there is justice for George Floyd, we will truly be on our way to racial justice in America.”

As the funeral began at noon, the New York Stock Exchange went silent for eight minutes, 46 seconds — the length of time a Minneapolis police officer held Mr. Floyd’s neck under his knee before he died. It was the longest moment of silence on the stock exchange floor in its 228-year history, a spokesman said.

The Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader who delivered the eulogy, admonished the country’s political and business leaders for belatedly saying they are sorry for the mistreatment of African-Americans. “Don’t apologize — give Colin Kaepernick a job back,” he said, referring to the former N.F.L. quarterback. “We don’t want an apology. We want him repaired.”

Mr. Sharpton promised to return to Minneapolis for the trial of the officers charged in Mr. Floyd’s death, and to march on Washington “by the tens of thousands” on the anniversary of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech in August.

One by one, Mr. Sharpton named the relatives of other black men and women who have been killed by the police and asked them to stand. Other mourners stood, too, until everyone in the sanctuary was on their feet and clapping, and the funeral of one man briefly became a funeral for all the other lives lost.

“The mother of Trayvon Martin, will you stand,” Mr. Sharpton said. “The mother of Eric Garner, will you stand. The sister of Botham Jean, will you stand. The family of Pamela Turner, here in Houston, will you stand. The father of Michael Brown from Ferguson, Mo., will you stand. The father of Ahmaud Arbery, will you stand.

“All of these families came to stand with this family, because they know better than anyone else the pain they will suffer from the loss that they have gone through,” Mr. Sharpton said.

The congressional delegation at the funeral brought a flag from Speaker Nancy Pelosi and promised that the family would be receiving letters from former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, according to Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, Democrat of Texas, who brought mourners to their feet.

“I want to acknowledge those young marchers in the streets,” she said. “Many of them could not be in this place. They are black and brown. They are Asian. They are white. They are protesting and marching, and I’m saying, as a mama, I hear your cry.” 

The day before Derek Chauvin was charged with murdering George Floyd, negotiations for a plea deal broke down, according to the Hennepin County attorney’s office.

Mr. Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who held his knee to Mr. Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes before Mr. Floyd’s death, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter on May 29. He was later charged with the upgraded offense of second-degree murder.

The state’s initial charges were announced one day after Erica MacDonald, the U.S. attorney for the District of Minnesota, began a delayed news conference by telling reporters: “We thought we would have another development that I could tell you about. Unfortunately, we don’t at this point.”

Ms. MacDonald then pledged a “robust and meticulous investigation” into Mr. Floyd’s death, without announcing charges or revealing what potential development she was referring to.

“If you watch the video and what she said, you could pretty easily figure out exactly what happened,” Chuck Laszewski, a spokesman for the Hennepin County attorney’s office, said in an interview on Tuesday night. “They were negotiating in there, and yes it fell apart.”

Mr. Laszewski said the discussions included Ms. MacDonald and Mike Freeman, the Hennepin County attorney, who handled the case before the governor appointed Keith Ellison, the state attorney general, to take over. The spokesman declined to describe the terms of a potential deal, say how long the negotiations took place or why they ended.

Neither Mr. Chauvin’s current or former lawyers immediately responded to requests for comment about the negotiations, which were earlier reported by Fox 9 in Minneapolis.

Members of Mr. Floyd’s family have said they want Mr. Chauvin to be charged with first-degree murder. He is being held in a maximum-security prison on bail of up to $1.25 million.

“Move back!” “Hey!” [gasps] “He is bleeding!” “Bleeding out his ears, bleeding out of his ears.” “Call a medic!

Get back!” “Better get an ambulance for him.” “He’s — there — we have EMT on scene.”

President Trump used Twitter on Tuesday to go after a 75-year-old demonstrator who suffered a head wound when Buffalo police officers knocked him over. Mr. Trump advanced, without any evidence, a conspiracy theory that the incident could have been “a set up.”

“Buffalo protester shoved by Police could be an ANTIFA provocateur,” Mr. Trump wrote. “75 year old Martin Gugino was pushed away after appearing to scan police communications in order to black out the equipment. @OANN I watched, he fell harder than he was pushed. Was aiming scanner. Could be a set up?”

Mr. Trump evidently was watching the One America News Network, a channel aimed at viewers who think Fox News is not supportive enough of the president. The network aired a segment referring to the incident as “so-called police brutality” and suggesting without evidence that it was a “false flag” staged by antifa, a loose movement of anti-fascists.

The reporter on the segment was Kristian Rouz, a Russian-born broadcaster who according to One America has also worked as a freelance contributor to Sputnik, a propaganda arm of the Russian government aimed at sowing doubt about the United States and the West.

Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, assailed Mr. Trump for relying on the report. “The story Trump is referencing was written by a Russian working for the Kremlin’s propaganda agency,” Mr. Murphy wrote on Twitter. “Get ready — this is the next 5 months. Russia and the Trump campaign openly collaborating to spread lies and manipulate the election.”

Two Buffalo officers were charged with felony assault after a widely viewed video taken by WBFO, a local radio station, showed them shoving Mr. Gugino, who fell to the pavement. 

The president’s tweet drew immediate condemnation.

“He should apologize for that tweet,” said Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York. “Show some humanity.”

“You think the blood coming out of his head was staged?” Mr. Cuomo asked, incredulously.

During a virtual fund-raiser on Tuesday night, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, remarked, “Did you see today where the president of the United States, while George Floyd was being buried, was condemning the older man who was knocked down with his head bleeding and everyone walking by. Did you see that? I mean, my lord. What have we become if we abide by this? So much we can do and must do.”

Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, said of the president’s tweet, “It was a shocking thing to say, and I won’t dignify it with any further comment.”

Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said of Mr. Trump’s tweet, “It’s a serious accusation — which should only be made with facts and evidence — and I haven’t seen any.”

Also on Tuesday, three leading Democratic senators sent a letter to the leaders of the F.B.I. and the intelligence community, Chris Wray and John Ratcliffe, demanding the public release of any information supporting Mr. Trump’s claims, in connection with the protests, that “professional anarchists” and “antifa” were committing “acts of domestic terror.” 

In the letter, obtained by The New York Times, Charles Schumer of New York, the minority leader, and Dianne Feinstein of California and Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking members of the Judiciary and Intelligence committees, called Mr. Trump’s claims “vague and unsubstantiated.” 

“These claims are highly inflammatory,” the senators wrote. “They also appear intended to frame the legitimate peaceful protests taking place around the country as a terrorism threat in order to justify unnecessary federal, even military, intervention and the excessive use of force.”

It started with one woman, Brianna Noble, who was impossible to miss as she rode her horse, Dapper Dan, among the thousands of protesters marching in Oakland, Calif., at the end of May. Soon, hundreds of other black cowboys and cowgirls around the country were joining in the protests over the death of George Floyd and against police violence and racism.

On Sunday in Compton, Calif., a group of black men and women known as the Compton Cowboys led a peaceful protest through the streets with Mayor Aja Brown. As hundreds of people marched alongside, the cowboys rode with their fists raised in the air, yelling “No justice, no peace” as the music of Kendrick Lamar, also from Compton, blared in the background.

“I could cry, and I never imagined anything like this,” said Randy Hook, one of the riders. “We’re making our family proud, our ’hood proud, and our city proud.”

There’s history here. Mounted riders have often had a prominent role in parades and demonstrations, both as participants and for security and crowd control. Their visibility, height and commanding nature make them a symbol of power.

And though you might not know it from movies and TV shows, during the heyday of the Old West in the 19th century, one out of every four cowboys was of African-American descent.

These days, there are black cowboys and cowgirls and black riding clubs in major cities across the country, some of them staples of local folklore and identity. They are guided by a love for the animals and an appreciation for the land they ride on. And they are turning out, very visibly. 

A New York City police officer surrendered to face criminal charges on Tuesday, 11 days after he was recorded on video shoving a woman to the ground and cursing at her during a protest against police brutality, law enforcement officials said.

The Brooklyn district attorney’s office charged the officer, Vincent D’Andraia, with misdemeanor assault, criminal mischief, harassment and menacing over the May 29 incident, according to a statement.

The district attorney, Eric Gonzalez, said in announcing the charges that he could not tolerate the use of excessive force against people exercising their right to peacefully protest. “This is especially true of those who are sworn to protect us and uphold the law,” he added.

Cellphone video showed Officer D’Andraia, 28, knocking the victim, Dounya Zayer, 20, to the ground and swearing at her after she asked him why he told her to get out of the street. Ms. Zayer said she suffered a concussion and seizures.

The decision to charge Officer D’Andraia seemed to reflect the growing political pressure on the police and prosecutors to hold officers accountable for misconduct, including for actions at protests across the country, where bystander video has played a crucial role in documenting police aggression. 

Ms. Zayer’s lawyer, Tahani Aboushi, said she was disappointed that prosecutors were not charging Officer D’Andraia with a felony, given the seriousness of her client’s injuries and the severity of the conduct captured on the video.

National Guard troops who were deployed to the streets of Washington during recent protests against police brutality have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to a spokesperson for the District of Columbia National Guard.

The Guard would not say how many, and it was not clear whether they were infected at the protests. 

The spokesperson said the troops have practiced social distancing and worn protective gear as much as was practical during the deployment. But public health experts have warned that large crowds at the protests in Washington and around the country risk accelerating the spread of the virus, which has killed more than 110,000 Americans. 

According to Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, around 5,000 National Guard troops who were deployed to the Washington area will begin to withdraw over the next three days, but around 1,200 troops from the District of Columbia National Guard will remain on duty.

The presence of the troops in the nation’s capital had become a source of local tension, particularly after top Pentagon officials ordered pilots of Black Hawk helicopters to fly low over groups of protesters in a “show of force” maneuver intended to disorient and disperse crowds.

Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington also publicly clashed with President Trump, saying the use of troops to patrol the city was an inappropriate response to the protests.

Philonise Floyd, a brother of George Floyd, will testify before Congress on Wednesday during a House hearing on police accountability and racial bias in law enforcement, according to a memo obtained by The New York Times.

Mr. Floyd will testify before the House Judiciary Committee, alongside more than half a dozen civil rights experts and activists, at a hearing designed to examine measures that Democrats unveiled on Monday, intended to reduce police misconduct and racial discrimination in law enforcement.

House Republicans invited Dan Bongino, the conservative political commentator and former Secret Service agent, to testify. They also invited Angela Underwood Jacobs, whose brother, Dave Patrick Underwood, a Federal Protective Services officer, was shot and killed late last month during a night of unrest in Oakland, Calif.

Senate Republican leaders said on Tuesday that they plan their own legislative push on the issues of racial discrimination and police brutality, to be led by Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only Republican senator who is African-American.

The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said his members would work on their own, without involving the White House, to put forward “what we think is the appropriate response.” 

“We are still wrestling with America’s original sin,” Mr. McConnell told reporters on Capitol Hill. “We try to get better, but every now and then it is perfectly clear we are a long way from the finish line.” 

In New York, thousands of protesters listened as relatives of victims of police brutality spoke outside City Hall on Tuesday evening, then wove their way through Lower Manhattan and SoHo, past boarded-up stores and businesses.

The police made no effort to block the protesters, as officers had last week when a curfew was in effect, leading to clashes. The mood on Tuesday was festive, with the smell of burning incense and the sound of drums and bells as protesters cheered and danced across Broadway. 

“This is the happiest protest I’ve been to,” said Jeffrey Castillo, 35, adding, “When I heard people experience this violence firsthand I didn’t really have a choice but to come.” 

Constance Malcolm, whose son, Ramarley Graham, was fatally shot by officers in his apartment in 2012, said she felt encouraged by a series of police reforms announced in recent days. But for Ms. Malcolm, who works in a nursing home, justice is still far away.

“I’ll feel satisfied when George Floyd’s murderers go to jail, because oftentimes, we see they don’t,” she said, adding that if all four officers were convicted in his killing, that would show the country was moving forward.

More than 200 Microsoft employees have signed a letter calling on the company to stop supplying software to law enforcement agencies; to support efforts to defund the Seattle Police Department; and to join a call for the mayor of Seattle, Jenny Durkan, to resign.

The signers are a tiny fraction of Microsoft’s more than 140,000 employees. But the letter is another sign of increasing activism by employees at major technology companies on a range of political issues, which executives have been forced to address — if only to explain why they would not comply with workers’ requests.

In the last two years, groups of Microsoft workers protested the company’s sales of technology to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and to the Defense Department. In both cases, Microsoft responded by explaining what its software was used for and why the company continued to work with the government — and argued that doing so was not an endorsement of every action the aiuthorities take. 

The most recent letter, sent on Monday and addressed to Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, and Kurt DelBene, executive vice president for strategy and operations, covers a wide range of grievances, including workplace issues. The letter called for instituting a four-day work week at the company and asked that the company not hold lost productivity because of protests or coronavirus-related problems against workers in their annual performance reviews.

But the letter begins by objecting to “the inhumane responses” of the Seattle police to protests in the city following the death of George Floyd, and asks Microsoft to take stands on broader political issues like supporting Black Lives Matter demands and condemning the use of tear gas and rubber bullets against peaceful protesters. It said that not all those who signed supported every request on the list.

A copy of the letter was published by the website OneZero. A Microsoft spokesperson said the letter was authentic, but declined to comment on it. 

Mayor Lenny Curry of Jacksonville ordered the removal overnight of a bronze Confederate soldier monument in Hemming Park and said similar statues would also come down. 

Hundreds of protesters had marched in the city over the weekend demanding that the monuments be removed. Mr. Curry, a Republican, walked with more demonstrators on Tuesday morning and pledged to bring legislation to the City Council to bring independent community voices into discussions about policing. “We hear your voices,” Mr. Curry said.

The city is considered a leading contender to host the Republican National Convention in August.

The order follows similar moves to remove symbols of the Confederacy in other cities, as the death of George Floyd and calls for racial justice reignited a movement that has been gaining traction — and meeting resistance — for years. 

The mayor of Birmingham, Ala., ordered the removal of a contentious Confederate statue from a park last week on Jefferson Davis Day, the state holiday in Alabama honoring the Confederate leader. 

In Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam ordered the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue in Richmond, a move that was temporarily blocked by a judge. 

The military is also turning away from Confederate symbolism. The Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Michael M. Gilday, said on Twitter Tuesday that he was directing his staff to draft an order banning the Confederate battle flag from all public spaces and work areas on Navy vessels, aircraft and installations. The Marine Corps issued a similar order last week. 

And on Monday, a spokesperson for the Army told Politico that the service’s top civilian leaders were open to renaming 10 bases named for Confederate officers, a step the Pentagon has resisted for many years.

"What Is Antifa, the Movement Trump Wants to Declare a Terror Group?","As President Trump and his Democratic opponent Joseph R. Biden Jr. enter the final stretch of the presidential campaign, a loosely affiliated group of far-left anti-fascism activists, known as “antifa,” has been the focus of a series of misleading rumors and false claims.

Seeking to assign blame for the protests against racial injustice that spread across the United States this summer, President Trump has said that the United States would designate antifa as a terrorist organization. The president’s critics noted, however, that the United States does not have a domestic terrorism law and that antifa, a contraction of the phrase “anti-fascist,” is not an organization with a leader, a defined structure or membership roles.

Rather, antifa is more of a loose movement of activists whose followers share some philosophies and tactics. They have made their presence known at protests around the country in recent years, including the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017.

Mr. Trump has also sought to tie Mr. Biden to “radical left” groups, including antifa — even though Mr. Biden opposes defunding the police, has repeatedly condemned violence and property damage associated with the protests, and has called for “arsonists and anarchists” to be prosecuted.

It is impossible to know how many people count themselves as members. Its followers acknowledge that the movement is secretive, has no official leaders and is organized into autonomous local cells. It is also only one in a constellation of activist movements that have come together in the past few years to oppose the far right.

Antifa members campaign against actions they view as authoritarian, homophobic, racist or xenophobic. Although antifa is not affiliated with other movements on the left — and is sometimes viewed as a distraction by other organizers — its members sometimes work with other local activist networks that are rallying around the same issues, such as the Occupy movement or Black Lives Matter.

Misinformation about the group often spreads through personal networks online. In many cases, false or misleading claims appear first in a tweet, Facebook post or YouTube video before they are shared through community texting networks, Facebook groups or the neighborhood social networking app Nextdoor.

Supporters generally seek to stop what they see as fascist, racist and far-right groups from having a platform to promote their views, arguing that public demonstration of those ideas leads to the targeting of marginalized people, including racial minorities, women and members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community.

“The argument is that militant anti-fascism is inherently self-defense because of the historically documented violence that fascists pose, especially to marginalized people,” said Mark Bray, a history lecturer at Rutgers University and the author of “Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook.”

Many antifa organizers also participate in more peaceful forms of community organizing, but they believe that using violence is justified because of their views that if racist or fascist groups are allowed to organize freely, “it will inevitably result in violence against marginalized communities,” said Mr. Bray, whose defense of the anti-fascist movement incited criticism and generated support at Dartmouth College when he was a lecturer there.

Although the Merriam-Webster dictionary says the word “antifa” was first used in 1946 and was borrowed from a German phrase signaling an opposition to Nazism, more people began joining the movement in the United States after the 2016 election of Mr. Trump, to counter the threat they believed was posed by the so-called alt-right, Mr. Bray said.

One of the first groups in the United States to use the name was Rose City Antifa, which says it was founded in 2007 in Portland, Ore. It has a large following on social media, where it shares news articles and sometimes seeks to dox, or reveal the identities and personal information of, figures on the right.

The antifa movement gained more visibility in 2017 after a series of events that put a spotlight on anti-fascist protesters, including the punching of a prominent alt-right member; the cancellation of an event by a right-wing writer at the University of California, Berkeley; and their confrontation of white nationalist protesters in Charlottesville who turned violent.

Mr. Bray said antifa groups often use tactics similar to anarchist groups, such as dressing in all black and wearing masks. The groups also have overlapping ideologies, as both often criticize capitalism and seek to dismantle structures of authority, including police forces.

The movement has been widely criticized among the mainstream left and right. After the protests in Berkeley, Calif., in August 2017, Speaker Nancy Pelosi decried “the violent actions of people calling themselves antifa” and said they should be arrested.

Conservative publications and politicians routinely rail against supporters of antifa, who they say are seeking to shut down peaceful expression of conservative views. These critics point to moments during which purported antifa members have been accused of sucker-punching Trump supporters.

But overblown fears and false claims about antifa can be dangerous in and of themselves. In Oregon, for example, after a wave of misinformation about left-wing activists intentionally setting fires began to interfere with firefighters’ efforts to contain the blazes there, law enforcement officials begged people to “STOP. SPREADING. RUMORS!”

Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history at New York University who studies fascism, said she was worried that antifa’s methods could feed into what she said were false equivalencies that seek to lump violence on the left with attacks by the right, such as the killing of a protester in Charlottesville by a man who had expressed white supremacist views.

“Throwing a milkshake is not equivalent to killing someone, but because the people in power are allied with the right, any provocation, any dissent against right-wing violence, backfires,” Professor Ben-Ghiat said in an interview last year.

Between 2010 and 2016, 53 percent of terrorist attacks in the United States were carried out by religious extremists — 35 percent by right-wing extremists and 12 percent by left-wing or environmentalist extremists, according to a University of Maryland-led consortium that studies terrorism.

Militancy on the left can “become a justification for those in power and allies on the right to crack down,” Professor Ben-Ghiat said. “In these situations, the left, or antifa, are historically placed in impossible situations.”

"Free Food, Free Speech and Free of Police: Inside Seattle’s ‘Autonomous Zone’","SEATTLE — On the streets next to a police station in Seattle’s Capitol Hill neighborhood, protesters and officers spent a week locked in a nightly cycle of standoffs, at times ending with clouds of tear gas.

But facing a growing backlash over its dispersal tactics in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, the Seattle Police Department this week offered a concession: Officers would abandon their building, board up the windows and let the protesters have free rein outside.

In a neighborhood that is the heart of the city’s art and culture — threatened these days as rising tech wealth brings in gentrification — protesters seized the moment. They reversed the barricades to shield the liberated streets and laid claim to several city blocks, now known as the “Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone.”

What has emerged is an experiment in life without the police — part street festival, part commune. Hundreds have gathered to hear speeches, poetry and music. On Tuesday night, dozens of people sat in the middle of an intersection to watch “13th,” the Ava DuVernay film about the criminal justice system’s impact on African-Americans. On Wednesday, children made chalk drawings in the street.

One block had a designated smoking area. Another had a medic station. At the “No Cop Co-op,” people could pick up a free LaCroix sparkling water or a snack. No currency was accepted, but across the street, in a nod to capitalism, a bustling stand was selling $6 hot dogs. It was dealing in U.S. dollars.

On Wednesday night, President Trump tried to portray the scenes in the city as something more sinister. He called for government leaders to crack down on the protesters, declaring on Twitter that “Domestic Terrorists have taken over Seattle.”

“Take back your city NOW,” Mr. Trump wrote in a tweet directed at Mayor Jenny Durkan and Gov. Jay Inslee that he repeated on Thursday. “If you don’t do it, I will. This is not a game.”

Ms. Durkan responded with a tweet of her own: “Make us all safe. Go back to your bunker.”

Carmen Best, the police chief, said in a video message on Thursday that the decision to leave the police station was not hers and that she was angry about how it developed. She also shared, without evidence, concerns about problems in the area, such as businesses being asked to pay money in exchange for protection.

Ms. Best said later in the day that nobody had made a formal report and that those issues were just circulating on places like social media. The Capitol Hill Business Alliance said it had been reaching out to businesses in the area and found no reports of any such problems.

The protest zone has increasingly functioned with the tacit blessing of the city. Harold Scoggins, the fire chief, was there on Wednesday, chatting with protesters, helping set up a call with the Police Department and making sure the area had portable toilets and sanitation services.

“I have no idea where we’re headed,” Chief Scoggins said in an interview. “We’ve been working step by step on how to build a relationship, build trust in small things, so we can figure this out together.”

The demonstrators have also been trying to figure it out, with various factions voicing different priorities. A list of three demands was posted prominently on a wall: one, defund the Police Department; two, fund community health; and three, drop all criminal charges against protesters.

But on a nearby fence, there was a list of five demands. Online was a list of 30.

While Mr. Floyd’s death in Minneapolis drove most of the energy in the streets toward ending police violence and racial injustice, some people here in recent days have pushed for a wider focus. Some of the messages mirror the 2011 Occupy movement and seemed aimed at targeting corporate America for its role in social inequities.

“The more we encourage and focus on the race thing, the greater our attention is not focusing on the fact that this is class warfare,” said a 28-year-old protester and self-described anarchist who identified himself only by his first name, Fredrix.

On Tuesday night, Kshama Sawant, a City Council member affiliated with the Socialist Alternative Party, led protesters to City Hall, holding a gathering inside the building in which she promoted her plan to tax Amazon, which is headquartered in the city.

But some of those who mobilized here over race and policing have begun to worry that these broader priorities could cloud the agenda at a time when vital progress for African-Americans seemed within reach.

“We should focus on just this one thing first,” said Moe’Neyah Dene Holland, 19, a Black Lives Matter activist. “The other things can follow suit. Because honestly, black men are dying and this is the thing we should be focusing on.”

The city prepared for the possibility that the street demonstrations could linger. On Wednesday, a team from the Seattle Department of Transportation came through intending to replace some of the orange barriers — including one marked “People’s Republic of Capitol Hill” — with planter boxes filled with coral bells and other plants to give the new pedestrian zone an air of permanence.

But when the crew went to remove the barriers, some of the protesters objected. The crew stood down, and Rodney Maxie, a deputy director at the transportation department, told his team they might return later, after further talks with the demonstrators.

“This is good practice for the 9.0 earthquake,” he told his team.

The protesters also had differing opinions about how long the autonomous zone would last. Some wondered if the Police Department would try to reclaim the territory. Others said they expected the barriers to be up for weeks, until state and city leaders had done enough to meet their demands.

John Moore, 23, said he hoped to see the autonomous zone become legally recognized. Mr. Moore wore a stethoscope and paramedic apparel in a makeshift health center set up on the patio of a taco restaurant. The medic team was looking for a more permanent space to provide health services, and Mr. Moore said they had dozens of people with a range of qualifications, from CPR certifications to experience in a Level 1 trauma center.

Mr. Moore said the experiment in a place without police officers could work.

“We are trying to prove through action and practice that we don’t need them and we can fulfill the community’s needs without them,” he said."
A Conversation With Janet Napolitano,"Good morning.

(Don’t already get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.)

Janet Napolitano has been a federal prosecutor, Arizona governor, Homeland Security secretary and pandemic point person (the H1N1 flu in 2009). Since 2013, she has been the University of California’s president.

Now 62, she will step down Aug. 1 to teach at the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley.

This week, she spoke to my colleague Shawn Hubler, from her dining room table in Oakland.

Here’s their conversation, edited and condensed:

So, pandemic, looming recession, nationwide protests — some timing.

I did offer to stay longer. But they were pretty far along in the search process. I think they’re getting pretty close to announcing my successor.

Really? Who will it be?

I have no idea.

Well, what should the next U.C. president bring, beyond the basics?

This is a big, important, complex institution. It’s now got over 285,000 students and a quarter of a million employees. We’re actually the third largest employer in California. I think the U.C. needs a strong leader who can balance centralized leadership with the desire of campuses to act independently. Sort of like the federal government and the states.

Post-coronavirus, what do your instincts tell you about U.C.’s future?

I think more students will have more of a hybrid education — in-person, high-touch, with professors there with them in the classroom, but also more available online.

How does that differ from, say, the Cal State system, which is going almost entirely online this fall?

Cal State’s presumption will be that everything is online, and you have to go through a complex process to have an exception. I think the U.C. will be much less regimented. The campuses will have more in-person offerings and will be repopulating the dorms at least to some degree.

[Read a conversation with the Cal State system’s chancellor, Timothy P. White, who announced last year he’d retire.]

Former Gov. Jerry Brown, with whom you clashed on spending, thinks the U.C. should completely rethink its business model. Do you agree?

No! He was always looking for a silver bullet on how to reduce the U.C. budget. For a long time, it was the massive open online courses, which turned out not to be successful. I think a university needs a university.

What should universities do to address the broad social unrest we’re seeing?

First, we have to acknowledge the anger that George Floyd’s murder evokes and recognize that it is not a one-off but a symptom of a much more deep-rooted, almost structural flaw in our country. We have never solved the issues involved in being a multiracial democracy.

Police and criminal justice rise to the top. But we also need to fix education, health and housing disparities. And universities need to fix their own houses with more diversity in hiring, promotion and graduate programs. And then put some minds to work on public policies.

Should California repeal Proposition 209 and bring affirmative action back into university admissions?

The Board of Regents hasn’t yet taken a position. My personal view is that if we are endeavoring to conduct holistic admissions, then leaving out any consideration of a person’s race seems to be a real gap.

[Read about the incoming chancellor of U.C. Merced and the campus’s role in educating first-generation students.]

Then there’s the pandemic, which for kids, seems to be dismantling some of the most important aspects of college.

I totally agree. But I also think students should try to stay in school and make progress toward their degree. While college won’t be normal, the normal reasons to take a gap year don’t exist either. What are you going to do? Sit home and bother your parents? No! Take some courses. Get on with it.

What mistakes did you make in your time at U. C.?

The most serious downer had to do with the audit of the office of the president in 2017 [which accused her of hiding budget reserves and suppressing internal criticism, which she disputed]. I apologized but we certainly could have handled that differently.

You were in treatment for breast cancer then. How’s your health now?

I’m all clear, thank you. But you know, no other institution of higher education does what the University of California does at the level and scale we do it. I worry about whether the people and their elected leaders in Sacramento really understand this terrific asset they have.

What do you think your legacy will be at U.C.?

Growth. Growth in undergraduate enrollment, in minority student enrollment, in transfer students. Applications are up, graduation rates are up — four-year graduation rate went from 63 percent when I started to 70 percent and the six-year rate is now 85 percent.

And I think we’ll be known for taking on big challenges. Having the goal of being carbon neutral by 2025. Being the first university in the country to sue the administration to oppose the repeal of DACA. Taking a leadership role on issues involving sexual harassment and sexual violence.

What’s next?

I bought a condo in North Berkeley. And I’m looking forward to society opening up enough so I can leave my dining room table.

How about a position in a Democratic administration?

Oh, never say never. But first we have to win the election. And there’s nothing on the table, so there’s nothing to talk about.

Last week, we were introduced to Brianna Noble, the black horsewoman who rode through downtown Oakland during a protest. Her image was striking.

This week, my former colleague Walter Thompson-Hernández caught up with the Compton Cowboys, who led a peaceful march through the city. According to Walter, who also wrote a book about the group, the presence of mounted demonstrators both subverts the association of horses with the authorities and taps into a long history of black cowboy and cowgirl culture across the country.

Yee-haw.

"Hickenlooper Stumbles in Colorado Race, Complicating Democrats’ Senate Push","KREMMLING, Colo. — For months, Democrats have figured that Colorado’s U.S. Senate race, a linchpin of their strategy to take back the majority in November, was essentially in the bag, with the Republican incumbent Cory Gardner trailing by double digits behind their candidate John Hickenlooper, the well-liked and well-known former two-term governor and Denver mayor.

But Mr. Hickenlooper, who was coaxed into the Senate contest after ending his brief presidential run, has faltered in recent weeks ahead of the primary race on Tuesday. He now finds himself in a tougher-than-expected contest with Andrew Romanoff, a former state House speaker and another longtime Colorado political presence, in a fight with significant implications for the general election and control of the Senate.

At a time when Democrats sense fresh momentum for flipping the Senate amid national crises that have tarnished President Trump and threaten to drag down Republican candidates, Mr. Hickenlooper’s shaky primary performance has been a rare dark spot in an otherwise brightening landscape. Democrats would have a difficult time capturing the majority without a Centennial State victory.

“He has had a bad June,” Kyle Saunders, a political-science professor at Colorado State University, said about Mr. Hickenlooper’s multiple travails and missteps. Chief among them was a contempt finding by the state’s independent ethics commission for defying a subpoena to appear at a hearing on a complaint against him — an event that prompted disastrous news coverage across the state.

Experts still expect Mr. Hickenlooper to win the primary — though perhaps not by the margin initially anticipated — and a recent poll found him with a commanding lead over Mr. Romanoff even as ballots are being cast under Colorado’s vote-by-mail system.

But Democrats worry that his rockier-than-expected race may leave him weakened for the general-election fight and give Mr. Gardner new life in a campaign where he was a rare incumbent underdog.

“He is limping out of this primary and now has a vulnerability that didn’t exist several weeks ago,” Dick Wadhams, a former state Republican Party chairman and veteran Senate campaign strategist, said about Mr. Hickenlooper and his run-in with the ethics panel.

The unexpected volatility of the primary — and the chance to inflict additional damage on Mr. Hickenlooper — has generated a last-minute surge of campaign advertising as national Republicans, Mr. Gardner and Mr. Romanoff have ganged up on Mr. Hickenlooper from the right and the left, while national Democrats and an independent group have swooped in to defend the former governor in the primary’s closing days. Millions of dollars are being spent.

Mr. Hickenlooper’s troubles go beyond the ethics complaint, which accused him of having improperly accepted private jet and limousine rides as governor.

In a series of forums and debates with his opponent, Mr. Hickenlooper, 68, made several eyebrow-raising statements. He said that George Floyd, the black Minneapolis man who died after a police officer knelt on his neck, had been shot. In response to a question about the Black Lives Matter movement, Mr. Hickenlooper said that every life matters, a comment considered dismissive of legitimate black grievances. He later acknowledged that he fumbled his response.

Then a six-year-old video surfaced of Mr. Hickenlooper comparing the rigors of a politician’s schedule to working on a slave ship, a remark critics cited as painfully insensitive. He again apologized.

Months earlier, in rejecting appeals to run for the Senate rather than president, Mr. Hickenlooper said multiple times that he was not cut out for the Senate and could not see being very good at it, only to turn around and join the race after getting no traction in his White House bid.

Allies of Mr. Hickenlooper say he has always lacked the verbal discipline of a typical politician — and that is part of the quirky, authentic personality that voters have come to appreciate and admire.

“Colorado voters know John Hickenlooper really, really well,” said Melissa Miller, a campaign spokeswoman. “What people really like about him is he is a real guy. He is not a slick, talking-point politician.” (The campaign declined to make Mr. Hickenlooper available for an interview.)

Mr. Hickenlooper’s gaffes would have provided negative campaign fodder in any event, but the biggest error came in his handling of a complaint filed by Republicans in 2018 that accused him of improperly taking gifts and private jet trips as governor.

Subpoenaed to testify on June 4 in a virtual hearing because of the pandemic, Mr. Hickenlooper and his legal adviser instead argued for a delay so he could appear later in person without the distractions and glitches of an online proceeding. He was then a no-show for the teleconference and the ethics commission held him in contempt, setting off a wave of negative coverage that made it appear as if he was not taking the complaint seriously.

Chastened, Mr. Hickenlooper testified the next day, defending the trips as either personal business or efforts to promote Colorado. But the commission eventually fined him $2,750 for two violations and refused to vacate its contempt finding.

National Republicans, who were always planning to hit Mr. Hickenlooper on the ethics question, accelerated their planned post-primary advertising to take advantage of the furor and aired a spot that rounded up news coverage hammering the former governor.

“We did it because of how badly Hick was mishandling the ethics hearing,” said Kevin McLaughlin, head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. “He and his team were bumbling idiots, and we felt like we couldn’t let the opportunity pass.”

Mr. Romanoff, who lost a Denver-area House race in 2014 and a primary battle for the Senate in 2010, has also taken Mr. Hickenlooper to task on the ethics issue, drawing rebukes from other Democrats who have urged him to drop the attacks.

By embracing “Medicare for all” and the Green New Deal, Mr. Romanoff has sought to contrast himself with Mr. Hickenlooper’s more moderate image and tap into the growing progressive bloc of Colorado Democrats who helped Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont win the state’s presidential primary this year with 37 percent of the vote.

Mr. Romanoff also said Mr. Hickenlooper’s campaign effort has validated the former governor’s original claim that he wasn’t that interested in joining the Senate.

“We haven’t detected any enthusiasm for his candidacy, including from him,” Mr. Romanoff said in an interview. “I just think it has been an appalling performance. There is nothing he has done in this campaign to convince me that he was wrong when he said he would be a terrible senator.”

Hoping to counter Mr. Romanoff’s criticism and a perception in some Democratic circles that he is out of step with the state’s evolving Democratic electorate, the Hickenlooper campaign has touted endorsements from Washington figures such as Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey, both of whom joined Mr. Hickenlooper in the presidential primary field.

“I feel like the momentum has changed in the last few days,” Mr. Hickenlooper said in a local television interview that aired on Friday, crediting the national endorsements and a rush of local and state Democrats who switched their backing from Mr. Romanoff to him after an attack ad from his rival.

With Mr. Hickenlooper under fire, Mr. Gardner has also plunged into the fray. His opening campaign ad mocked Mr. Hickenlooper’s early comments about his lack of interest in being in the Senate, with Mr. Gardner pretending to be a therapist and noting that Mr. Hickenlooper has some issues to work through.

“To do this job, you probably need to want this job,” a smiling Mr. Gardner says at the end.

Republican strategists say they believe that Mr. Gardner, a polished campaigner who led the party’s Senate campaign organization in 2016, could hold off Mr. Hickenlooper given the weaknesses the former governor has displayed in the primary.

Yet even with Mr. Hickenlooper’s troubles, Democrats and analysts say that Mr. Gardner’s fate is tied to that of Mr. Trump, who lost the state in 2016 to Hillary Clinton and is trailing former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in polls here.

They say that Mr. Gardner, who early on endorsed the president for re-election, has not done enough to separate himself from Mr. Trump, who was an anchor on the senator’s campaign even before the president’s most recent decline in popularity.

“There is too much drag on him from the president and it is getting even worse,” said Floyd Ciruli, a longtime pollster and Colorado political analyst. “I just have a hard time seeing Cory being able to beat that tide.”"
Do Police Officers Make Schools Safer or More Dangerous?,"The national reckoning over police violence has spread to schools, with several districts choosing in recent days to sever their relationships with local police departments out of concern that the officers patrolling their hallways represent more of a threat than a form of protection.

School districts in Minneapolis, Seattle and Portland, Ore., have all promised to remove officers, with the Seattle superintendent saying the presence of armed police officers “prohibits many students and staff from feeling fully safe.” In Oakland, Calif., leaders expressed support on Wednesday for eliminating the district’s internal police force, while the Denver Board of Education voted unanimously on Thursday to end its police contract.

In Los Angeles and Chicago, two of the country’s three largest school districts, teachers’ unions are pushing to get the police out, showing a willingness to confront another politically powerful, heavily unionized profession.

Some teachers and students, African-Americans in particular, say they consider officers on campus a danger, rather than a bulwark against everything from fights to drug use to mass shootings.

There has been no shortage of episodes to back up their concerns. In Orange County, Fla., in November, a school resource officer was fired after a video showed him grasping a middle school student’s hair and yanking her head back during an arrest after students fought near school grounds. A few weeks later, an officer assigned to a school in Vance County, N.C., lost his job after he repeatedly slammed an 11-year-old boy to the ground.

Nadera Powell, 17, said seeing officers in the hallways at Venice High School in Los Angeles sent a clear message to black students like her: “Don’t get too comfortable, regardless of whether this school is your second home. We have you on watch. We are able to take legal or even physical action against you.”

During student walkouts to protest gun violence and push for climate action over the past two years, some officers blocked students from leaving school grounds or clashed verbally with protesters, she recalled. At Fremont High School in another part of Los Angeles, where the student body is about 90 percent Latino, the police used pepper spray in November to break up a fight.

“All people who are of color here are looked at as a threat,” Ms. Powell said.

For years, activists have called on districts to rein in campus police. They cite data showing that mass shootings like those in Parkland, Fla., or Newtown, Conn., are rare, and that crime on school grounds has generally declined in recent years.

The presence of officers in hallways has a profound impact on students of color and those with disabilities, who, according to several analyses and studies, are more likely to be harshly punished for ordinary misbehavior.

Still, efforts to remove school resource officers face the same pushback as a broader national effort to reduce funding for police departments: resistance from the police themselves, who are often politically powerful, and concern from some parents and school officials that removing officers could leave schools and students vulnerable.

In Oakland, Jumoke Hinton Hodge, a school board member, said that although she strongly supported the Black Lives Matter movement, she opposed the effort to eliminate district police officers. Those officers are better equipped to work with teenagers than are the city police, who could be called to schools more often if the district no longer had its own force, she said.

The district’s officers train to prevent school shootings, Ms. Hinton Hodge said, and they respond to students who have reported sexual abuse or are at risk of suicide. The proposal to eliminate the force felt rushed, she said, and would leave the district without an adequate safety plan.

“Are you here for the long haul, about a movement?” she asked. “Or are you in a moment?”

In New York City last weekend, hundreds of teachers and students marched in a protest calling for the police to be removed from schools and replaced by a new crop of guidance counselors and social workers. Mayor Bill de Blasio committed to diverting some of the Police Department’s funding to social services for children, but has so far not shown a willingness to significantly reduce police presence in hallways.

Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago has rejected calls from the teachers’ union and others to remove officers from schools, saying they are needed to provide security.

Both mayors control their city’s school systems. It is districts with elected school boards, which are more independent from other local government agencies, that are currently driving the wave of change.

Mo Canady, executive director of the National Association of School Resource Officers, said he was disappointed by attempts to link school policing to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. He called Mr. Floyd’s death during an arrest “the most horrific police abuse situation I’ve seen in my career.”

Well-trained school resource officers operate more like counselors and educators, Mr. Canady said, working with students to defuse peer conflict and address issues such as drug and alcohol use. He suggested that disproportionate discipline and arrest rates for students of color and those with disabilities could be driven by the actions of police officers coming off the street to respond to one-off calls from schools, or by campus officers who lack adequate training in concepts such as implicit bias.

“The message to the districts has to be, ‘Don’t throw the baby out with the bath water,’” Mr. Canady said.

But as schools face significant budget cuts brought about by the coronavirus pandemic, some students, educators and policymakers say it would be wiser to hire psychologists to provide counseling and nurses to advise students on drugs and alcohol, instead of training police officers to do such tasks.

In Prince George’s County, Md., outside of Washington, Joshua Omolola, 18, has marched to protest the killing of Mr. Floyd. Now, as the student member of the Board of Education, he is supporting a proposal to remove police officers from the county’s schools, whose students are predominantly black and Hispanic.

The millions the county spends annually on school policing should be reallocated to mental health services, Mr. Omolola argued, to treat the root causes of student behavioral problems.

Police departments have typically responded to calls from school employees, but the everyday presence of officers in hallways did not become widespread until the 1990s. That was when concern over mass shootings, drug abuse and juvenile crime led federal and state officials to offer local districts money to hire officers and purchase law enforcement equipment, such as metal detectors.

By the 2013-14 school year, two-thirds of high school students, 45 percent of middle schoolers and 19 percent of elementary school students attended a school with a police officer, according to a 2018 report from the Urban Institute. Majority black and Hispanic schools are more likely to have officers on campus than majority white schools.

But when the Congressional Research Service reported on the effectiveness of school resource officers in 2013, it concluded that there was little rigorous research showing a connection between the presence of police officers in schools and changes in crime or student discipline rates.

Activists who have worked for years to remove officers from hallways said they were shocked at the speed with which school districts were promising significant change after Mr. Floyd’s death. The coming weeks may equal the impact of a decade’s worth of incremental reforms, according to Jasmine Dellafosse, an organizer in Stockton, Calif., east of San Francisco, with the Gathering for Justice, a nonprofit group.

After the A.C.L.U. Foundation of Northern California and the state Department of Justice investigated harsh discipline practices in Stockton schools, the district police force agreed last year to establish new restrictions on the use of force and on when to arrest students.

Now the school board plans to consider, later this month, a resolution to remove police officers entirely from schools and to reallocate their budget to programs such as ethnic studies, counseling and restorative justice.

“There won’t be real change,” Ms. Dellafosse said, “until police are out of the schools.”

Why Protest Movements Are ‘Civil’ Only in Retrospect,"The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. of the public imagination was a unifying figure who bridged America’s bitter racial divide and peacefully liberated the South from Jim Crow.

The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. who actually existed was spied on and blackmailed by the federal government, arrested roughly 30 times, beaten, stalked and assassinated, and died one of the most disliked people in America.

In life, despite his commitment to nonviolence, he was not seen as a model of socially acceptable protest. But in death, he is presented as such by opponents of newer movements, including the demonstrations that have spilled from Minneapolis into thousands of cities and towns in response to the police killing of George Floyd.

These sorts of transformations happen repeatedly in the accounting and recounting of social movements, historians say. As movements unfold, the most disruptive parts tend to get disproportionate attention, and critics often portray them as representative of the whole. In the retelling, the least confrontational parts get the same treatment: People sanitize the movement for public consumption, downplay its opposition and use the mythologized version to discredit its successors.

So it is that the Rosa Parks in many history textbooks just wanted to sit after a long day of work, when the real Rosa Parks was a longtime activist who sat as a calculated political act; that the suffragists most popularly memorialized are those who circulated petitions, not those who burned President Woodrow Wilson in effigy outside the White House; that the antiwar activists who went to Woodstock are better known than the ones who ransacked draft board offices and destroyed the files.

What emerges is not only an antiseptic image of individual activists, but an oversimplified division between “right” and “wrong” ways to protest that historians and social scientists say impedes understanding of how movements achieve their goals.

“The whole purpose of protest is to interrupt your daily life, to interrupt the previously scheduled programming so you pay attention to something new,” said Deva Woodly, an associate professor of politics at the New School who studies how movements use public discourse. “That’s not necessarily the same thing as condoning setting buildings on fire, but it’s certainly not the case that plain civility is something that would ever work.”

Social movements are almost always messy — and that’s part of what can make them effective, historians say. The neatly packaged narratives exist only in retrospect.

“You can tell a story about civil rights in which Martin Luther King made a good speech and then the government changed — and Martin Luther King did make good speeches, and government policies did change, but a lot of other stuff was happening at the same time,” said David S. Meyer, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Irvine. “Promoting social change requires a complicated recipe, and to pull out and identify one ingredient and say ‘this is the one that matters’ is either bad social science or just deceptive.”

The vast majority of the recent protests against systemic racism and police brutality have been peaceful, and they have also become increasingly popular, with public opinion of the Black Lives Matter movement shifting extraordinarily quickly. Polls show that a majority of Americans now believe, for instance, that the police are more likely to use deadly force against black people.

Yet there remains an intense focus on a small subset of behavior. When a recent Monmouth poll, for instance, asked whether respondents supported the protests, it included one specific incident in the question: “the burning of a police precinct in Minneapolis.” While 57 percent said the protesters’ anger was “fully justified,” just 17 percent said their actions, when described that way, were.

Some of the United States’ most prominent social movements have involved violent confrontation — from the abolitionist John Brown’s 1859 raid on Harpers Ferry to the Haymarket affair of 1886 to the 1969 Stonewall riots — and the results don’t fit a neat pattern. In terms of plain effectiveness, apart from moral and philosophical considerations, it is not always the case that peaceful protest helps a movement achieve its goals and violent protest hurts it.

Omar Wasow, a political scientist at Princeton, found that the riots after Dr. King’s assassination drove some voters toward Richard Nixon’s “law and order” platform in 1968 — yet a year later, Stonewall gave a major lift to the gay rights movement. Researchers have found that the 1992 Los Angeles riots led to “a marked liberal shift in policy support at the polls” — yet they also became a major issue in the city’s 1993 mayoral race, in which Angelenos elected their first Republican mayor in 36 years.

Most often, historians say, social movements succeed in the vast space between riots and “civility.”

Public opinion has a poor track record of predicting what will be effective: A Gallup poll in 1961 found that 57 percent of Americans thought sit-ins and the Freedom Rides hurt the chances of integration in the South. And after the 1963 March on Washington, where Dr. King delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech, Gallup found that 74 percent of Americans believed mass demonstrations harmed the cause.

Dr. King himself was highly unpopular during his lifetime, as two of his children emphasized.

“There’s always going to be a group that attempts to demonize that which is being done — and for their own purposes, not because it’s right, good or just, but just because they want to foster a different position,” said Martin Luther King III, Dr. King’s oldest son. “Dad totally used the method of nonviolence, and he was consistently criticized.”

Bernice King, Dr. King’s daughter and chief executive of the King Center, said she believed the sanitized version of his work “reflects attempts to not only diminish my father’s courage and tenacity in speaking truth to power, but also reflects attempts to diminish the power of nonviolence.”

Whether they involve a rally, a raised fist or a bent knee, protests have always drawn a public backlash. In fact, the very tactics some point to as models now were considered too confrontational then — leading Dr. King, in his “Letter From a Birmingham Jail,” to denounce “the white moderate, who is more devoted to ‘order’ than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ‘I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action.’”

Carol Faulkner, a historian at Syracuse University, reeled off a list of brutal public responses to peaceful protests as far back as the 1830s, when a white mob tied a rope around the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison’s waist and dragged him through the streets of Boston, and more than 10,000 people descended on a meeting site for abolitionists in Philadelphia and burned it to the ground.

Nineteenth-century women’s suffragists “went out of their way to present themselves as very middle-class, very respectable, and used the tools of respectable politics,” Dr. Faulkner added. But their message made them targets even when their tools were petitions and town-hall meetings, and those tools were not always effective.

In 1860, the suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton addressed the House Judiciary Committee for two hours, after which The New York Times reported, “She was earnest, and eloquent, and plausible, but she must have felt that she was not convincing her audience — and she did not.”

By the time the 19th Amendment was ratified, the movement had split into factions: the moderate National American Woman Suffrage Association, or NAWSA, and the more radical National Woman’s Party. After N.W.P. members burned President Wilson in effigy in February 1919, Mary Garrett Hay of NAWSA said their “outrageous performances” undermined the whole movement.

Yet some of the N.W.P.’s actions — or, more precisely, the police treatment of the women arrested for those actions — helped turn public opinion in the movement’s favor, Dr. Faulkner said, much as the vicious attacks against civil rights protesters did and police crackdowns may be doing now.

This was an explicit part of Dr. King’s strategy: using nonviolent protest to provoke a response that would put the brutality of Jim Crow on display.

“He did not believe in violence, but he believed in nonviolent direct action that would lead to a confrontational crisis situation,” said Daniel Q. Gillion, a professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania and author of “The Loud Minority: Why Protests Matter in American Democracy.” “That’s why he broke the law that he didn’t think was right, and the reason why he sent kids out there to deal with Bull Connor fully knowing that Bull Connor was going to unleash dogs or do something hysterical.”

Dr. Gillion ranks the intensity of protests by giving one point for each of nine characteristics: more than 100 participants, duration longer than a day, backing from a political organization, participants carrying weapons, a police response, arrests and — regardless of which side causes them — property damage, injuries or deaths.

He has found that the intensity of protests in a congressional district affects the voting record of the district’s representative, and that intense protests are associated with higher voter turnout among people who are ideologically aligned with the protesters.

Conversely, in his book “Polite Protest,” Richard Pierce, a historian at the University of Notre Dame, studied a nonconfrontational civil rights movement in Indianapolis and found that it was no more successful than the confrontational movements in other cities.

“They never marched, they never protested out loud, they negotiated, they used meetings — they were still held back,” Dr. Pierce said. “Blacks can’t continue to wait around to find an acceptable form of protest that will generate 100 percent approval on the other side, because that doesn’t exist.”"
Protesters Try to Pull Down Statue of Andrew Jackson in Washington,"This briefing has ended.

Protesters threw ropes over a statue of President Andrew Jackson near the White House on Monday night and tried to pull it down, in the latest attempt to remove memorials of marred historical figures, including Confederate leaders and Christopher Columbus.

Police officers with riot shields and pepper spray confronted the demonstrators in Lafayette Park, leading to some tense encounters shared on social media. The statue of Jackson on horseback ultimately remained upright, unlike dozens that have been toppled or taken down in recent weeks as the nation grapples with systemic racism.

Jackson, the seventh president, owned slaves and put into place policies that forced Native Americans from their land, with some 15,000 people dying on the Trail of Tears.

President Trump, who had a portrait of Jackson hung in the Oval Office shortly after his inauguration, condemned “the disgraceful vandalism” of “the magnificent Statue” in a tweet late Monday night.

Several other presidential statues have recently been targeted.

Protesters in Portland, Ore., toppled a statue of George Washington, and a statue of Ulysses S. Grant was pulled to the ground in San Francisco. The American Museum of Natural History in New York announced it would take down a statue of Theodore Roosevelt, and some City Council members want a statue of Thomas Jefferson removed from City Hall.

The dismantling of contentious statues began with a focus on those honoring members of the Confederacy. For weeks, protesters have converged on a statue of the commander Robert E. Lee in Richmond, Va., one of the most prominent on the city’s Monument Avenue.

On Monday, state officials announced that the Lee statue, which Gov. Ralph Northam has been trying to remove, would be closed to the public from sunset to sunrise. Officials outlined a list of safety concerns, including vandalism, trespassing, littering and public urination.

According to the state’s order, police officers will “encourage voluntary compliance” before taking any enforcement action. But it was unclear whether protesters would respect the closure order.

Mel Leonor, a reporter for The Richmond Times-Dispatch, wrote on Twitter that a crowd of protesters cheered on Monday when one suggested that they meet at the monument after 8 p.m. regardless of the closure.

Another night of gunfire at Seattle’s protester-led “autonomous zone” sent a person to the hospital with injuries, the second round of gun violence over the weekend in an area where officers had pulled out of the police station.

Susan Gregg, a spokeswoman at Harborview Medical Center, said one person who had been shot in or near the zone was brought by private vehicle for treatment late Sunday night. The victim was in serious condition, Ms. Gregg said. The Seattle Police Department said it was investigating a reported shooting inside the zone.

On Saturday morning, separate shootings left a 19-year-old man dead and another in critical condition.

The zone was declared this month in the wake of clashes between protesters and the police after the death of George Floyd, a black man whose death in police custody in Minneapolis touched off protests around the world.

Seattle decided to board up the police station in the neighborhood in hopes of de-escalating tensions after several nights of standoffs in the streets.

But the city has found in meetings with businesses and residents in the area around Cal Anderson Park that the situation in the neighborhood has become more dangerous at night, said Kelsey Nyland, a spokeswoman for Mayor Jenny Durkan.

Ms. Durkan said she was working with different groups to focus on de-escalation strategies in the neighborhood.

The family of Rayshard Brooks, the 27-year-old black man who was fatally shot by the police in Atlanta on June 12, honored his life at a public viewing on Monday.

The hourslong viewing took place at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. served as co-pastor with his father from 1960 until he was assassinated in 1968.

A private funeral service for Mr. Brooks is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, when he will be eulogized by the Rev. Raphael G. Warnock, the church’s senior pastor and a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate.

Dr. King’s daughter, the Rev. Bernice A. King, will also speak at the funeral, CNN reported. Tyler Perry, the television and film actor, producer and director, has offered to cover the funeral costs, according to the family’s lawyer.

Mr. Brooks’s fatal encounter with the police, which was captured on body-camera and witness video, touched off angry protests in Atlanta, and gave new impetus to efforts across America to address systemic racism and excessive use of force by the police.

The encounter began when two officers awakened Mr. Brooks, who had fallen asleep at the wheel of a car in the drive-through line of a Wendy’s restaurant. It remained calm for more than 40 minutes as the two officers questioned him and performed a sobriety test. But when they tried to arrest him, he scuffled with them, broke away and ran. One of the officers, Garrett Rolfe, shot him in the back after Mr. Brooks fired a stolen police Taser.

Mr. Rolfe, who was fired from the police force the next day, has been charged with 11 counts, including murder. The other officer, Devin Brosnan, has been charged with three counts, including aggravated assault. 

Thousands of people affiliated with universities including Harvard, Stanford and the University of Michigan received a violently racist email over the weekend that seemed to be from Equity Prime Mortgage, a company that had recently fired the stepmother of a former Atlanta police officer accused of killing a black man.

“Equity Prime is a lender for WHITES only!!” said the email, according to a version some recipients circulated on Twitter. “That’s how we have such low rates!”

The email also included a slur for African-Americans and a reference to lynching.

It was unclear why prominent universities were targeted, but email addresses of professors are often fairly public. A Harvard professor, Robert F. Reid-Pharr, wrote on Twitter that he had previously received racist emails, but never with the “bluntness and directness” of this one.

Equity Prime said in a statement that the company was “a victim of a malicious racially charged email campaign,” and was working with the F.B.I. to determine what entity or organization was responsible. A list of email addresses that did not belong to the company was used to populate a “Pre-Qualify for a Loan” web form, the statement said.

Until last week, the human resources director at Equity Prime was Melissa Rolfe, whose stepson, Garrett Rolfe, is charged with felony murder in the fatal shooting of Rayshard Brooks outside a Wendy’s restaurant. There is no evidence that Ms. Rolfe was responsible for the email, which was sent after she was fired.

Equity Prime said it fired Ms. Rolfe because she had created a “hostile” working environment, and many co-workers no longer felt comfortable with her, according to a message prominently posted on its website. 

Ms. Rolfe did not respond to requests for comment.

In a message to the Stanford community, the university’s chief information officer, Steve Gallagher, said that about 3,600 people with Stanford email addresses had received “a racially offensive email” before the university blocked its distribution.

The president of Harvard, Lawrence Bacow, called the email “abhorrent.”

“Thousands of our community members received a hate-filled, racist email threatening African Americans,” Mr. Bacow wrote in a message to the Harvard community, adding, “Please do not open it.”

The garage at an Alabama racetrack where someone placed a noose inside the stall of the lone black driver in NASCAR’s top racing series was fitted with surveillance cameras, officials said Monday, potentially offering crucial clues in an inquiry that has drawn in the federal authorities.

The episode on Sunday, in the garage stall of Darrell “Bubba” Wallace Jr. at the Talladega Superspeedway, came less than two weeks after NASCAR, at Mr. Wallace’s urging, banned the Confederate battle flag from its races and properties, and as the motor sports empire opened a new effort to distance itself from its history of racism.

In a statement on Monday, Jay E. Town, the United States attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, said that federal officials were “reviewing the situation surrounding the noose that was found in Bubba Wallace’s garage to determine whether there are violations of federal law.”

“Regardless of whether federal charges can be brought, this type of action has no place in our society,” Mr. Town said.

The Justice Department announced its review, which is operating in parallel to an investigation by NASCAR, hours before Mr. Wallace was scheduled to drive at Talladega, where Sunday’s NASCAR Cup Series race was postponed because of bad weather.

“This will not break me,” Mr. Wallace said in a statement on Sunday night, after NASCAR announced that a noose had been found. “I will not give in, nor will I back down. I will continue to proudly stand for what I believe in.”

The sustained outcry over the killing of George Floyd in police custody has compelled many white Americans to acknowledge the anti-black racism that is prevalent in the United States — and perhaps even examine their own culpability.

Large numbers of white Americans have attended racial justice demonstrations, purchased books about racial inequality and registered for webinars on how to raise children who are anti-racist. Some have asked themselves pointed questions, like how much professional advantage they have garnered from being white, and whether they would willingly cede it if they could. Others are going to tattoo parlors to cover up images of Confederate flags, swastikas and Ku Klux Klan symbols on their bodies.

Amy Harmon and Audra D.S. Burch write that it is hard to know yet how deep or wide these responses run — and whether they are the result of pressure from peers to appear tolerant, or a sign of meaningful action to come.

In some of the same communities where white liberals have been marching with Black Lives Matter signs, efforts to integrate public schools and neighborhoods have met steep resistance. And what some consider a profound questioning of white supremacy can seem to others to be laughably little and unconscionably late.

The most frustrating thing about this moment, said Jeremy O. Harris, a playwright and the writer of “Slave Play,” is “listening to white people say this is the first time they realize how bad it is.”

In interviews, some white Americans admitted that even the process of reflecting on racism underscored for them how little grasp they had of the everyday experience of being black in America.

“Many white Americans have chosen places to live, places to send their children to school, places to vacation, jobs to pursue, in ways that allow them to avoid thinking about racial inequality,” said Jennifer Chudy, a political scientist at Wellesley College. Her research suggests that only one in five white Americans consistently expresses high levels of sympathy about racial discrimination against black Americans.

The bronze statue of Theodore Roosevelt, on horseback and flanked by a Native American man and an African man, which has presided over the entrance to the American Museum of Natural History in New York since 1940, is coming down.

The decision, proposed by the museum and agreed to by New York City, which owns the building and property, came after years of objections from activists and at a time of reckoning about the country’s past. For many, the equestrian statue at the museum’s Central Park West entrance has come to symbolize a painful legacy of colonial expansion and racial discrimination.

“Over the last few weeks, our museum community has been profoundly moved by the ever-widening movement for racial justice that has emerged after the killing of George Floyd,” the museum’s president, Ellen V. Futter, said. “We have watched as the attention of the world and the country has increasingly turned to statues as powerful and hurtful symbols of systemic racism.”

Ms. Futter made clear that the museum’s decision was based on the statue itself — namely its “hierarchical composition”— and not on Roosevelt, whom the museum continues to honor as “a pioneering conservationist.”

“Simply put,” she added, “the time has come to move it.”

The museum took action amid a heated national debate over the appropriateness of statues or monuments that first focused on Confederate symbols like Robert E. Lee and has now moved on to a wider arc of figures, including Christopher Columbus and Winston Churchill.

Last week alone, a crowd set fire to a statue of George Washington in Portland, Ore., before pulling it to the ground. Gunfire broke out during a protest in Albuquerque to demand the removal of a statue of Juan de Oñate, the despotic conquistador of New Mexico. And New York City Council members demanded that a statue of Thomas Jefferson be removed from City Hall.

The New York Police Department suspended an officer without pay on Sunday, after cellphone video showed the officer appearing to use an illegal chokehold in making an arrest.

The encounter took place on the Rockaway boardwalk Sunday morning, nine days after the City Council passed a law that, among other things, made the use of a chokehold by the police a criminal offense.

The law was passed in response to weeks of protests in New York and across the country against police brutality and systemic racism in law enforcement. The man who was arrested on the boardwalk, Ricky Bellevue, is 35 and black. His relatives say he has a history of mental illness.

The police commissioner, Dermot F. Shea, said on Twitter on Sunday evening that, after a “swift investigation,” the officer involved in the “disturbing apparent chokehold incident in Queens has been suspended without pay.”

“While a full investigation is still underway, there is no question in my mind that this immediate action is necessary,” Commissioner Shea said. “We are committed to transparency as this process continues.”

Body camera footage released by the Police Department showed Mr. Bellevue and two other men, all of whom appear to be intoxicated, taunting police officers for about 10 minutes while the officers remain calm and even laugh. Then, Mr. Bellevue reaches into a trash can and appears to be holding something. He asks twice if the officers are scared, before the officer wearing the camera rushes in to grab him.

The cellphone video of the encounter shows three officers on top of Mr. Bellevue, including one who appears to press his forearm into the man’s neck for 10 seconds while bystanders yell that he is being choked.

Lori Zeno, the executive director of Queens Defenders, which is representing Mr. Bellevue, identified that officer as David Afanador. The shield number seen in the video matches Officer Afanador’s name in a public database of federal lawsuits against the police that is maintained by the Legal Aid Society.

Mr. Bellevue lost consciousness during the arrest, Ms. Zeno said, and he had a bloody scalp and swollen wrists when she saw him at the police station. “He was on such a hard chokehold that he couldn’t speak to say he couldn’t breathe,” she said. He was taken into custody on suspicion of disorderly conduct, obstructing governmental administration and resisting arrest, she said.

New York State enacted a law two weeks ago making it a felony for the police to use chokeholds that result in serious physical injury or death. But the City Council legislation goes further, applying to any maneuver intended to cut off breathing, regardless of whether it results in injury. 

In passionate debate over removing Confederate symbols across the South, one of the most conspicuous holdouts is Mississippi, which has the battle flag of Robert E. Lee’s rebel army prominently embedded in its state flag and has resisted efforts to change it for decades.

With Confederate statues and other monuments with racist associations being toppled across the country in the wave of Black Lives Matter protests, the debate over the Mississippi flag has gathered momentum.

“This is the time we’re going to get this done,” said the Rev. Darren Leach, the senior pastor at Genesis Church in Columbus, Miss., near the Alabama state line. “It’s a good chance for the good people of Mississippi to just do what they know they should do: Get us out from under this blight. The flag is a blight.”

The pressure has ratcheted up in recent weeks as forces outside Mississippi have denounced the flag.

The National Collegiate Athletic Association announced on Friday that it would not host any championship events in states where the Confederate battle flag was a prominent, sanctioned symbol. The day before, the Southeastern Conference made a similar threat; two of its 14 members are the University of Mississippi and Mississippi State.

Business leaders have also been vocal about the flag being an economic liability in a state that is already one of the poorest in the country.

The flag is deeply polarizing in the state. A referendum to change it failed overwhelmingly in 2001, but a poll taken this month found that supporters and opponents are now in a statistical tie, broken largely on racial and partisan lines. And in recent weeks, many in the Republican-dominated State Legislature have signaled a willingness to see it changed.

A recent survey of lawmakers conducted by Mississippi Today, a nonprofit news organization, found that 65 members of the House and Senate wanted the Legislature to change the flag; seven wanted to keep the flag; and 51 from both houses wanted voters to decide.

Defenders of the flag have also mobilized, calling the challenge to the flag an assault on their history and culture by left-wing radicals. “This is not about a flag,” Chris McDaniel, a Republican state senator, said in a Facebook video for his supporters. “It’s about finally and firmly saying no.” 

Britain commemorated Windrush Day on Monday, a celebration to honor a generation of Caribbean migrants who were invited in 1948 to rebuild the economy after the devastation of World War II.

The British government introduced the day to celebrate the contributions of the migrants in 2018, after a scandal that saw hundreds of them wrongly detained, deported or denied legal rights.

Thousands of Caribbean migrants arrived in Britain between 1948 and 1973 and were given an automatic right to live and work without need for additional documentation. They were called the “Windrush generation” because the first group arrived in Britain in June 1948 on board the Empire Windrush passenger liner.

But when the British government introduced new immigration laws in 2012, members of the Windrush community were unable to prove their legal immigration status and many of them were stripped of their rights.

In 2018, the government apologized and insisted that members of the Windrush community were welcome, and a compensation program was introduced for those who had been wrongfully detained or deported.

Fewer than 5 percent of claims made under the program have been paid out, according to official figures, and a group of Windrush campaigners went to Downing Street last week to deliver a petition signed by more than 130,000 people, demanding that the government speed up compensation payments and address the failings that resulted in the scandal.

transcript

“Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.” “Thank you. [cheering] So we begin, Oklahoma, we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma, and thank you to Vice President Mike Pence. We begin. We begin our campaign. Five months from now, we’re going to defeat Sleepy Joe Biden. [cheering] Boy, does he get a pass from these people, huh? We’re going to stop the radical left. We’re going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion and creed. [cheering] Republicans are the party of liberty, equality and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln, and we are the party of law and order. Covid — to be specific, Covid-19. That name gets further and further away from China as opposed to calling it ‘the Chinese virus.’ [cheering] We saved hundreds of thousands of lives, and all we do is get hit on like we’re terrible. And what we’ve done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment and with testing — you know, testing is a double-edged sword. We’ve tested now 25 million people. Here’s the bad part: When you test of — when you do testing to that extent, you’re going to find more people, you’re going to find more cases. So I said to my people, slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests that people don’t know what’s going on. The unhinged left-wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments —” Crowd: “Boo!” “— tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control — we’re not conforming. That’s why we’re here, actually. [cheering] This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place.”

President Trump’s bid to revive his re-election campaign was off to a rambling start on Saturday night as a far smaller crowd than expected turned out in Tulsa, Okla., for his first rally in months. For almost two hours, he rehashed familiar, grievance-filled themes, demonizing the media and “radical’’ Democrats while bragging about his response to the coronavirus pandemic, even though his administration’s faltering management of the crisis has been widely criticized. 

Mr. Trump, appearing in one of his political strongholds from 2016, had hoped that the rally would amount to a self-described “comeback” after politically bruising months. Instead, the event only raised questions about his drawing power and political skills at a time when his poll numbers are falling and allies are worried about his electoral prospects for a second term.

Mr. Trump mocked the coronavirus that has killed 121,000 Americans and claimed he wanted to slow down testing, as he addressed a mostly maskless crowd in a 19,000-seat indoor arena in Tulsa that was sparsely filled. 

And on the day after Juneteenth, in a city that had one of the worst episodes of racial violence in the nation’s history, Mr. Trump barely spoke about race and did not once mention George Floyd, a black man whose killing by white police officers set off a national reckoning about the country’s own racist past. Instead, he defended Confederate monuments and claimed that the left wanted to “demolish our heritage.”

Taking the stage, Mr. Trump framed the rally as the start of his campaign. “We begin, we begin our campaign,” he said, though the campaign had officially kicked off exactly a year ago this week in Orlando, Fla.

He started off by praising the crowd: “You are warriors, thank you,” adding, “we had some very bad people outside.” In reality, there were few protests and heavy security around the BOK Center, which was sparsely filled. Mr. Trump blamed the media for reporting on health concerns ahead of the indoor rally and suppressing the crowd size.

Throughout his speech, Mr. Trump tried to target Democrats. “Try putting A.O.C. in charge of your energy,” he said at one point, referring to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, after bragging that he “got it back together,” apparently referring to an agreement he signed in April for countries to cut back oil-producing output. 

Mr. Trump went on an extended rant against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic nominee, who is leading the president in the polls and out-raised him by $7 million in the month of May. Mr. Trump described Mr. Biden as a “helpless puppet of the radical left.” He then said that Mr. Biden himself had never been a radical leftist, but claimed he was controlled by the fringes of his party.

The president once again shrugged off the threat from the coronavirus, at one point calling it the “Chinese virus.” He bragged that he has done “a phenomenal job” fighting the pandemic. But he also said that he asked officials to “slow the testing down,” joking that a young man with the “sniffles” would be falsely considered a positive Covid-19 case.

He went on to say, “Open the schools, please.” In the next breath, he blamed the “unhinged left-wing mob” for desecrating the country’s history and tearing down monuments. “They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place,” he said.

Mr. Trump at one point went into an extended riff about how much was demanded of him physically during a speech to graduating cadets at West Point, in order to defend himself against an unflattering video that showed him walking gingerly down a short ramp from the stage. Mr. Trump claimed there was nothing wrong with his health.

Almost two hours into the address, he had yet to make any statement acknowledging the Juneteenth holiday, celebrating the end of slavery, or the country’s deep reckoning with its racist past, which has erupted since the killing of Mr. Floyd on May 25 in Minneapolis. Instead, he demonized people who had mostly been demonstrating peacefully as radical “rioters.’’

Mr. Trump had hoped to pack the 19,000-seat BOK Center and show that America is reopening, but he did not want to bear responsibility for creating a “super spreader” event that sickened his most die-hard supporters. Saturday afternoon brought an inauspicious start to that effort, when his campaign said that six staff members who were working on the event had tested positive for the virus during routine screening.

Masks were being handed out as supporters filed into a designated area at the arena Saturday afternoon, but wearing them was not enforced. Some people threw masks out immediately after they received them.

Inside the arena, meanwhile, most of the attendees were not wearing masks or social distancing. But the bigger concern for Mr. Trump was that as the rally started the arena appeared only a little more than half full. However, about 500,000 people were watching the rally on YouTube across different feeds.

Campaign advisers, who had hyped a mega-rally that would help undercut polls that show Mr. Trump’s support sagging nationwide, claimed that their supporters had trouble entering the arena, and blamed “radical” protesters and the media.

“Sadly, protesters interfered with supporters, even blocking access to the metal detectors, which prevented people from entering the rally,” said Tim Murtaugh, the campaign communications director. “Radical protesters, coupled with a relentless onslaught from the media, attempted to frighten off the president’s supporters. We are proud of the thousands who stuck it out.”

But in reality, there were few protests across the city, and black leaders in Tulsa called for people to stay away from the rally. There was also a huge security presence around the arena.

Mr. Trump had originally been scheduled to address an overflow crowd of supporters outside, but those plans were also scrapped at the last minute. The campaign did not make it clear why, although the outdoor area was only sparsely populated.

Mr. Trump spoke for about an hour and forty minutes, short of his record 123-minute speech he delivered in Michigan last December, after the House of Representatives voted to impeach him. The crowd quickly cleared out of the BOK Center after Mr. Trump and his entourage departed.

In Tulsa, the 19,000-seat BOK Center remained underfilled for President Trump’s first rally in months, with a crowd that was well below the campaign’s expectations. 

A planned appearance by Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence to an outdoor stage outside the arena, to address what was expected to be an overflow crowd, was canceled, as just dozens of supporters were waiting by the stage at the time the speakers were supposed to arrive. 

The Trump campaign blamed protesters interfering with supporters and blocking access to metal detectors for the smaller-than-expected crowd. Some users of social media suggested that teenagers helped keep attendance at the rally down by buying up tickets they did not intend to use.

Inside the BOK Center, surrogates and Mr. Trump’s supporters took turns ignoring the empty space and seeking to rally the crowd. A local Oklahoma sheriff called Mr. Trump a friend of law enforcement, referencing the national unrest that has broken out over police brutality and racial injustice. 

All the trappings of Mr. Trump’s signature rallies were back. Red hats that read “Make America Great Again” greatly outnumbered the amount of masks, even as the event took place during the coronavirus pandemic. 

Mr. Trump’s go-to playlist roared from the speakers, with favorites like the Village People’s “Y.M.C.A” and “In The Air Tonight” by Phil Collins greeting longtime rally-goers used to hearing their favorite tunes. 

However, as Mr. Trump was preparing to take the stage, the floor space in front of the podium remained only about half full, and the top rung of seats at the BOK Center remained largely empty.

Outside the arena, dozens of supporters stood outside as Mr. Trump spoke, listening to snippets of his speech with a handful of protesters holding signs nearby. Soon, dozens more protesters marched through, bearing signs with messages like “Black Lives Matter” and “Go Home Donald.”

The crowd quickly swelled to hundreds of anti-Trump protesters, with both camps forming circles around combatants from both sides as they exchanged heated words. But about 20 minutes later, only one large group remained. One man tried to start an “all lives matter” chant as a man in a Black Lives Matter shirt spoke, but it did not catch on. Within minutes, however, protesters marched through again, and the arguments resumed.

Mr. Trump repeatedly referred to disturbances outside the BOK Center from protesters that he suggested disrupted his supporters trying to enter the rally. 

“Look at what happened tonight,” he said. “Law enforcement said, ‘Sir, they can’t be outside, it is too dangerous.’ We had a bunch of maniacs come and sort of attack our city. The mayor, the governor did a great job. But they were very violent. And our people are not nearly as violent, but if they ever were, it would be a terrible, terrible day for the other side.”

This lacks evidence. Reporters for The New York Times and other news organizations at the rally reported there were few protests and clashes with Trump supporters. A journalist for The Los Angeles Times said on Twitter that an entrance was closed briefly but no one was turned away. 

Even on the Fox News Channel, coverage leading into Mr. Trump’s rally showed few people milling about outside Tulsa’s BOK Center and noted that there was little interaction between Trump supporters and people protesting his event.

Mr. Trump began his rally with some oft-repeated falsehoods, Linda Qiu reports. 

He claimed to have “spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States military.”

This is misleading. The $2 trillion figure refers to the defense budgets for the past three fiscal years: $671 billion in 2018, $685 billion in 2019 and $713 billion in 2020. But Mr. Trump’s suggestion that the military needed to be completely rebuilt when he entered office is wrong.

Adjusted for inflation, the Pentagon operated with larger budgets every year from the 2007 fiscal year to 2012 fiscal year, peaking at $848 billion in 2008.

Mr. Trump also wrongly suggested that ramped up testing is why the United States has reported the highest number of cases. “When you do testing to that extent, you’re going to find more people, you’re going to find more cases,” he said.

This is false. The United States had conducted more than 26 million tests and recorded more than 2.2 million cases. But this still likely undercounts the scale of the pandemic, and ramped up testing does not account for the high number of cases. 

Mr. Trump’s suggestion that the number of cases is proportional to the number of tests does not hold water. Brazil has the second highest number of cases at over 1 million, but it has conducted 2.4 million tests. Conversely, Russia has conducted 16.7 million tests and reported about 577,000 cases. 

Other metrics show that the pandemic is just more severe in the United States than other countries. For example, the United States conducts roughly 21 tests to find one case, whereas Italy, one of the countries hardest and earliest hit by the coronavirus, performs about 188 tests to find a case. Russia has conducted more daily tests on a per-capita basis than the United States, but its share of tests that come back as positive is lower.

Mr. Trump also claimed to have signed the largest tax cuts in history. 

This is false. Several other tax cuts rank higher.

Ahead of President Trump’s rally, his campaign acknowledged that six staff members who were working on the event had tested positive for the virus during routine screening.

“Six members of the advance team tested positive out of hundreds of tests performed, and quarantine procedures were immediately implemented,” said a campaign spokesman, Tim Murtaugh. “No Covid-positive staffers or anyone in immediate contact will be at today’s rally or near attendees and elected officials.”

“As previously announced, all rally attendees are given temperature checks before going through security, at which point they are given wristbands, face masks and hand sanitizer,” Mr. Murtaugh added.

Mr. Trump, made aware of the infected campaign aides before departing for the rally, was incensed the news was made public, according to two people familiar with his reaction.

In the hours before the rally, cloth masks were handed out to supporters as they filed into a designated area, but wearing them was not enforced. Some people threw masks out immediately after being handed them, and few wore them at the outdoor concert next to the arena.

According to the event’s staff, an attendee who failed a temperature check would be placed in a cooling room and given a second test, to account for the hot weather. If they failed that test, the staff member said, they would not be allowed entry.

Public health officials have warned that these measures would not prevent the spread of a positive case of coronavirus, and would not identify individuals who are asymptomatic carriers. Leaders in Mr. Trump’s administration and campaign have repeatedly dismissed these concerns, and emphasized the importance of an individual person’s right to not wear a mask, if they choose.

Hours before the rally, Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma, a Republican, told reporters that he did not believe Mr. Trump’s event would cause a spike in coronavirus deaths in the state.

“We built capacity in our hospitals and our P.P.E., and we have 211 people in the hospital,” Mr. Stitt said. “So my question back to those folks that want people to bunker in place is, like, ‘When is the right time to open back up?’”

Mr. Stitt, speaking to reporters in Tulsa, expressed confidence in the state’s phased reopening that began in late April, and its handling of the pandemic, recent protests and the preparations for the rally.

“The goal was never to have zero cases,” Mr. Stitt said. “And so these other states that are sitting here, do they think they’re going to have zero cases in August or September or October or November?” 

Oklahoma reported a record number of new virus cases on Thursday, with 450, and 352 new positive tests on Friday. 

Mr. Stitt said he had several conversations in recent days with Mr. Trump. Asked if the president told him why he selected Tulsa, Mr. Stitt said, “Some of the reasons he chose here was because of the good data that we had, because we were one of the first states to reopen. He just wanted to highlight that.” 

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic nominee, has declined to hold large events out of concern that they could further spread the virus. 

Following a relatively quiet night in Tulsa, Trump supporters assembled on Saturday near the BOK Center, where President Trump is scheduled to hold his evening rally, adding to the crowd that had spent days camping in lawn chairs and tents in a line that stretched for several blocks.

The mood among many supporters was exuberant as they awaited the president’s return to the campaign trail after months without rallies amid the coronavirus outbreak. Some attendees already knew each other from previous Trump events and reunited with old friends. Others played music or struck up chants of “four more years!”

A few hundred supporters gathered Saturday morning at Fourth and Cheyenne, the first rally checkpoint, about two blocks from the arena. A majority of them wore red Make America Great Again hats, while others had on hats with patriotic emblems or colors. Some waved red, white and blue banners with the Trump 2020 logo, the American flag or the “Don’t Tread on Me” flag. 

Almost none wore masks. 

“If it is God’s will that I get coronavirus, that is the will of the Almighty,” said Robert Montanelli, a resident of a Tulsa suburb who chose not to wear a mask. “I will not live in fear.” 

Angela, a Tulsa city employee who refused to give her last name, also said she did not want to wear a mask. “I am a healthy young woman,” she said. She compared coronavirus to the flu.

Mike Pellerin, from Austin, Texas, wore a T-shirt saying, “Are we dead yet?” “I am 68,” he said proudly. “I don’t feel sick. I don’t have the virus. I’m not going to give it to anyone.” 

Just before noon on Saturday, the police arrested a woman in an “I Can’t Breathe” T-shirt outside the BOK Center, The Tulsa World reported. The woman, Sheila Buck, who lives in the city, said she had a ticket to the rally and was arrested for trespassing. 

Just hours before President Trump’s rally was set to begin in Tulsa, local black leaders held a news conference in the city’s Greenwood neighborhood pleading with the mayor to cancel the event. 

The community members, who included religious leaders and civil rights activists, stood in front of the memorial dedicated to the victims of the massacre of black Tulsans by a white mob in 1921. 

Invoking the tragedy, they argued that the rally would wound a city that has worked hard at creating a shared language of racial reconciliation. They also said the city’s black community may bear the brunt of a coronavirus resurgence, if the rally helps increase infections in the area. 

“It is purposeful that this moment is happening to Tulsa right now,” said Greg Robinson II, a progressive activist who is running for mayor. 

The leaders’ focus on the mayor, G.T. Bynum, is intentional. Mr. Bynum, a Republican, has tried to cast himself as a friend of the city’s black community. He also said this week that the city was “honored’’ to be hosting Mr. Trump’s rally.

Pastor Robert Turner of the Vernon A.M.E. church on Greenwood Avenue, one of the only structures still standing from 1921, said he understood the chances that the mayor would cancel the rally were slim. But he said the leaders sought to pressure Mr. Bynum to “stand up the president.” 

“This is more about scoring political points with this president than the health of their citizens,” Mr. Turner said.

On Saturday, Jack Graham, an aide to Mayor Bynum, formally resigned from his position in a letter he posted on Twitter.

Mr. Graham, who is white, wrote that he could no longer support the mayor and his decisions. Mr. Graham worked for the city for 13 months in an entry-level position, according to Michelle Brooks, a spokeswoman for the mayor. It is unclear which decisions Mr. Graham was referring to in the letter. He could not immediately be reached for comment.

On Saturday, the twin sister of a man shot and killed by a police officer in 2016 said Mr. Trump’s visit to the city was an affront to her family and to the memory of the hundreds of African-Americans who died in the 1921 riot.

In 2016, a police officer shot and killed her brother Terence Crutcher, 40, a black motorist who was walking away from his vehicle with his hands up. The confrontation was captured on video, and led to the officer, Betty Jo Shelby, being charged with first-degree manslaughter in the death of Mr. Crutcher.

Officer Shelby was later found not guilty of manslaughter.

Tiffany Crutcher, Mr. Crutcher’s sister, said in an interview that she and her brothers are descendants of a survivor of the 1921 massacre, Rebecca Brown Crutcher.

“As an African-American and a descendant of the survivor of the worst domestic terror act against black people, it’s a slap in the face,” Ms. Crutcher said of Mr. Trump’s visit, as she sat at the Vernon A.M.E. church. “We know the residual effects that come out of his rallies — the rhetoric, the spew, the hate, the bigotry. All of those things are simply a recipe for a disaster for Tulsa, Oklahoma.”

Later on Saturday, about 400 people gathered at Tulsa’s Veteran’s Park as a counter to the Trump appearance. Air Force One flew over as the participants gathered, eliciting boos.

“For someone to bring that clown car of hate into Tulsa is wrong,” said one speaker, David Bragg-Sutton. “We must have peace.”

Mr. Trump’s remarks are scheduled to come one day after the Juneteenth holiday, which celebrates the abolition of slavery in the United States. The rally was originally scheduled to fall on the holiday, but Mr. Trump moved it to Saturday after public pressure and quiet lobbying. 

Political leaders in Minnesota promised sweeping reforms after George Floyd’s killing turned their state into a focal point for nationwide fury and grief over police killings and racism.

But those efforts collapsed early on Saturday as leaders in the Minnesota Legislature — the only one in the country where Democrats control one chamber and Republicans the other — failed to compromise on a package of law-enforcement reform measures before a special session ended.

Ultimately, legislators could not come to an agreement that reconciled the Democrats’ calls for far-reaching changes to police oversight with Republicans’ efforts to pass a shorter list of “common-sense police reforms,” which included banning chokeholds in most situations and requiring officers to stop their colleagues from using unreasonable force.

Democrats said the Republicans’ plan consisted of tepid half-steps that were already in place in most law-enforcement agencies and did not rise to the moment’s calls for dramatic action. Republicans balked at Democratic proposals to restore voter rights to tens of thousands of felons and put the state’s attorney general, Keith Ellison, a Democrat, in charge of prosecuting police killings.

Democrats in the House shared a late counteroffer, dropping those demands. And Republican leaders said they had agreed to alter arbitration proceedings when officers are accused of misconduct.

But as the clock ticked toward a midnight deadline on Friday — and then far past it — leaders of both parties blamed each other for failing to reach a compromise. The breakdown finally came just after 6 a.m. on Saturday, when both chambers adjourned without a deal.

The Legislature’s failure to pass a bill was a disheartening turn for activists who have pushed for far-reaching changes to policing, including cutting police budgets or dismantling police departments altogether to reduce the presence of armed officers in minority neighborhoods.

Some lawmakers said they hoped that Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, would call them back again next week or later in the summer to take up the issues, but activists worried that the window to change the laws was closing as the 2020 election approaches. 

In Colorado on Friday, Gov. Jared Polis signed into law a bill to remove the shield of legal immunity that has long protected police officers from civil suits for on-the-job misconduct, a measure civil libertarians hailed as landmark legislation.

The Colorado state legislature passed the bill last week.

Mr. Polis, a first-term Democrat, took the 155th anniversary of Juneteenth, celebrating the abolition of slavery in the United States, to formally enact the law.

Part of a Seattle neighborhood overtaken by protesters was the scene of a shooting Saturday that left one person dead and another wounded, officials said.

The shooting unfolded early Saturday morning near the main entrance of a protester-run area that has been celebrated as a “no cop” zone. Last week, the Seattle Police Department made the unusual decision to abandon a police station in the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood, board up the windows and let protesters have free rein outside, in the wake of demonstrations nationwide over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. 

Protesters took over several city blocks, named it the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone and put up a banner on the front entrance of the now-empty station reading, “This space is now property of the Seattle people.” The zone, with the atmosphere of a street festival or commune, drew the ire of President Trump, who called on Twitter for officials to crack down on protesters and declared that “Domestic Terrorists have taken over Seattle.”

The authorities said the victim who died was a 19-year-old man, and the person wounded was a man of unknown age who was being treated for life-threatening injuries.

The Seattle police said in a statement that the shooting occurred inside the protest zone. Officers responded to a report of shots fired at about 2:30 a.m. in Cal Anderson Park, inside the autonomous zone, which is also being called the Capitol Hill Organized Protest (C.H.O.P.) area.

“Officers attempted to locate a shooting victim but were met by a violent crowd that prevented officers’ safe access to the victims,” the police statement said. The police later said that they had been informed that the two men had been transported to the hospital by protest-zone medics.

The suspect or suspects had fled, they said, and the motive behind the shooting was not known. 

The police acknowledged the unusual circumstances of conducting a homicide investigation in a no-police zone, writing in their statement that detectives are “conducting a thorough investigation, despite the challenges presented by the circumstances.”

Videos taken at the scene and posted on social media by Converge Media showed the volunteer medics racing through crowds of onlookers in the pre-dawn darkness.

As armed police officers in riot gear entered the zone, people screamed, “The victim left the premises!” 

Tensions were high as some protesters appeared to object to the entry of the police. At one point, protesters briefly surrounded a police car and then yelled, as the vehicle sped away, “Whose streets? Our streets!”

Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington said on Saturday that he was saddened to hear of the shooting, but he said it was clear that the government needed to be able to provide protection for all citizens, including in that zone. 

“We have to have a way to provide police services and fire services in that area,” Mr. Inslee said.

There’s a Reason Trump Is Fighting Hard for Arizona,"PHOENIX — At the start of 2020, optimistic Democrats already thought this might be the year when a presidential election turned Arizona blue again.

Many suburban moderates were fed up with President Trump; in 2018, they sent a Democrat to the Senate from their state for the first time in more than three decades. Young Latino voters — who now make up 24 percent of eligible voters in Arizona — were casting ballots at record rates, angered by the president’s anti-immigrant rhetoric. And the party was fielding a strong candidate for November’s Senate race.

Now, four months until Election Day, that optimism is hardening into sustained confidence.

Mr. Trump is scheduled to campaign here on Tuesday, in a state whose 11 electoral votes he badly needs to hold to be re-elected, especially if he loses any of the three Midwestern states he flipped in 2016.

Democratic officials believe that frustrations over Mr. Trump’s immigration policies and his handling of the pandemic, as well as polling trends, indicate that Joseph R. Biden Jr. has the best shot of any Democratic presidential candidate to win Arizona since Bill Clinton carried the state in 1996. And the Biden campaign sees winning Arizona as not just a path to victory, but also a confirmation that Latino and immigrant voters are a strong and dependable part of the party.

Mr. Trump will arrive in Phoenix in a moment of acute turmoil in Arizona. The coronavirus pandemic is growing evermore deadly in the state, which is experiencing some of the steepest spikes in the country. Thousands of protesters have filled the streets for weeks, angered not only by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis that led to nationwide demonstrations, but also over the case of Dion Johnson, 28, a black man who was shot and killed by state troopers last month after being found asleep in a car on a Phoenix highway.

For frustrated and anxious voters, the dual crises of police brutality and a pandemic point to an opportunity for Democrats.

“There are people coming to protests who have never shown up before, who are seeing the kinds of things we’ve seen for years and that will unquestionably help us,” said Representative Ruben Gallego, a Democrat who represents Phoenix and is an enthusiastic supporter of Mr. Biden, the former vice president and the presumptive Democratic nominee.

Still, Mr. Gallego and other Democrats know what formidable odds they have in Arizona. The state has long been a hotbed of conservative activism; it was here that anti-immigrant politicians rose to power in the early 2000s, using the same kind of rhetoric later embraced by Mr. Trump.

The Republican governor, Doug Ducey, easily captured the state with 56 percent of the vote in 2018 and the legislature is controlled by the G.O.P. Though Hillary Clinton spent considerable money in the state and many in her party were optimistic in 2016, Mr. Trump won with 48 percent of the vote.

As many Arizonans attempt to return to a pre-pandemic life, flocking to indoor bars and restaurants amid triple-digit temperatures, interviews with dozens of voters in the Phoenix area in the last week showed how the government’s impact on everyday life was increasingly on their minds.

“For a long time, it was hard to understand what politics has to do with you, like that’s something over there and you’re over here,” said Bethany Marshall, 31, a math teacher in Phoenix and occasional Democratic voter. “Now, we’re doing, we’re watching, we’re not going away.”

For nearly three weeks, Ms. Marshall and several of her friends have joined marches near the State Capitol, where razor wire and a double-layer chain link fence keep protesters away from the building. A few feet away two monuments face each other: one is for Martin Luther King, the other commemorates the confederacy. All the crowds have been filled with black, brown and white faces, most of them young.

At protests, one speaker after another implores the crowd to vote. Register to vote here, and if you’re already registered, find five friends who are not.

“The only way for enough to actually be enough is to get out there and vote, have people with faces who look like mine, to get police to stop harassing us,” Alexander Sojourney, a recent graduate of Arizona State University and the organizer of a protest earlier this month, told a large crowd marching to the capitol. “Get people in office who can fix that and change that.”

Those crowds, and voters like Mr. Sojourney, are part of the reason that Democratic officials are confident they can win both the presidential and Senate races in the state.

The Biden campaign has repeatedly called Arizona one of its prime targets and Mark Kelly, the Democratic Senate candidate, has a multimillion dollar fund-raising advantage over Senator Martha McSally, his Republican opponent. Polls have shown Mr. Kelly with a double-digit lead and Mr. Biden ahead of Mr. Trump.

Arizona voters are roughly evenly split on party registration, according to the secretary of state, with Republicans making up 34.9 percent of the electorate, Democrats 32.5 percent and unaffiliated voters — the fastest growing group — 31.8 percent. And in a state where voting by mail is already widely embraced, Democrats say their advantage could be even stronger.

In the final three months of the 2018 campaign, for every two voters that registered as Republicans in the state, three registered as Democrats, which helps explain how several Democrats won statewide office that year.

Nowhere is the liberal optimism more prevalent than in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix and the majority of Arizona’s population. In 2016, when Mr. Trump won the state, Maricopa voters also kicked out Joe Arpaio, the longtime Republican sheriff who had championed draconian anti-immigrant policies. The county is widely seen as the most competitive in the country.

“The same people who defeated Arpaio will defeat Trump,” said Mr. Gallego.

Democrats are not only counting on younger new voters — they are also focused on convincing suburban moderates that they should abandon the Republican Party.

Aaron Marquez, a former captain in the Army Reserves, runs VetsForward, a Democratic-aligned group that relies on military veterans to sway voters in swing districts.

He spends time each week in the northwest suburbs of Phoenix, areas that were once entirely retirement communities but increasingly attract families in search of more affordable housing, delivering boxes of food to potential voters in need.

They set down boxes overflowing with milk, tortillas, grapes and sprinkled doughnuts and ask people what they would want Mr. Trump to know about the virus and its impact on their lives.

Mr. Marquez has met plenty of people who are frustrated, but the program also indicates the challenge for Democrats. With each delivery, voters are asked to rank the president’s handling of the pandemic on a scale of zero to 10. Among the roughly 100 deliveries so far, the responses have been about evenly split.

And Republicans are hardly ceding the state. Mr. Trump will land here Tuesday for his third visit in the last five months, speaking at a Phoenix megachurch in an event billed for college students. Last weekend, Ms. McSally held her first in-person fund-raiser in months, with guests sipping on Martha-ritas at an airport hangar.

A detailed county map shows the extent of the coronavirus outbreak, with tables of the number of cases by county. 

Ms. McSally said she approved of Mr. Ducey’s handling of the pandemic. “Some other states have been very draconian and dictatorial,” she said, adding that she preferred Arizona’s approach of giving people information and “allowing them to make good decisions for themselves.”

“When Arizona started to open up, I went and got my haircut, was able to safely do that,” she said, describing her desire to support small businesses. “I go out to restaurants. I’m young and healthy. I went and got a pedicure.”

In a state strangely split between lockdown and an embrace of normalcy, there is widespread confusion and distrust of the government. Those who feel invincible or rebellious are heading to bars even as hospitals report that they are close to running out of space in their intensive care units.

Democratic mayors in Phoenix and Tucson clashed for weeks with Mr. Ducey, who until last week had prevented them from requiring face masks in public. (The mayor of Phoenix has said that the city has no plans to issue citations to anyone not wearing masks at the president’s event Tuesday.)

And even among protesters, there is far from universal enthusiasm for Democrats, particularly Mr. Biden and Mr. Kelly. Leighton Mendez, 24, a Phoenix resident at another protest, said that her prior lack of interest in voting had been replaced with an understanding that elected officials decide on policy that affects her.

“I’m not sure why it took this long, but being out here, I’m really connecting the dots,” she said, though she quickly added: “It is not enough to just be not as bad as the other guy.”

Diane Fellows Morazan was also out protesting, wearing a T-shirt with a handwritten message: “Today we march, November we vote.”

“More of us are angry, more of us are eager to do something with whatever power we have, and we know that’s with our ballot,” she said.

There are other signs that even once-loyal Republicans are considering a change this fall. Black Lives Matter protests have taken place in dozens of suburbs once seen as conservative throughout the state.

Jenna Plopper, 31, of Surprise, Ariz., said that after voting for Mr. Trump in 2016, her perspective started to change. In the past month, she has attended several demonstrations against police brutality in the suburbs, along with many other young, white mothers.

Ms. Plopper said that while many of her Republican friends planned to support Mr. Biden, she was leaning toward a third-party candidate. What she is certain of, though, is that this year is different from 2016.

“I kind of just took the outlook from my parents: you’re going to vote, and this is how we vote,” she said, of her support for Mr. Trump. “I saw him as a lesser of two evils. Now, after listening to all he says and his actions, a lot of people like me are saying we don’t want this guy.”"
Lots of Drama but Little Certainty in Kentucky and New York Primaries,"WASHINGTON — Voters in Kentucky and New York were selecting nominees in extraordinary circumstances on Tuesday, as fears about the coronavirus reduced the number of polling places and led to a surge in absentee balloting that was almost certain to delay the results, possibly for days.

Kentucky Democrats were deciding who would be their nominee against Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, in a race that was testing the power of money against the potency of the grass-roots activism that has sprung up around the Black Lives Matter movement.

Amy McGrath, a former Marine pilot who raised well over $40 million, was dominating the primary for months until state Representative Charles Booker roared into contention in recent weeks. His candidacy was lifted by the energy that rose up in response to the killing of Louisville’s Breonna Taylor and other unarmed black Americans by white police officers.

But even as voters turned out at a reduced number of polling stations in Kentucky, New York and Virginia, it was unclear when the party nominees would be known. With the coronavirus prompting officials to lead an aggressive push for absentee voting, the final results of the race were not expected for days. So in a close race, it may not be clear who won on Tuesday night or even Wednesday.

Indeed, The Associated Press, which traditionally calls races for many news organizations, said the Senate contest in Kentucky was among the dozens of races in the state in which it did not declare winners on Tuesday. Because of the delays caused by the virus, the A.P. said the state did not expect to release additional results until June 30 and it would not call any winners until then.

There were, however, a handful of contests where the results were decisive, most notably, and embarrassingly for President Trump, in the western North Carolina House seat left open by the resignation of Mark Meadows, who became Mr. Trump’s chief of staff.

Mr. Meadows preferred a friend of his, real estate developer Lynda Bennett, and had Mr. Trump endorse her and even record an automated call on her behalf. But Ms. Bennett was routed in Tuesday’s runoff by a 24-year-old political newcomer, Madison Cawthorn.

Mr. Trump’s Twitter tirade this spring against Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, who forced the House back into session during the pandemic, also did little to slow Mr. Massie, who easily won renomination.

In New York City, Representatives Jerrold Nadler, the chair of the high-profile House Judiciary Committee, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had both faced primaries. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez easily won her race, according to the A.P., and Mr. Nadler led his competition by a wide margin on Tuesday evening.

In Virginia, the most hotly-contested House primary illustrated the appeal in this moment of black candidates in racially diverse districts. Cameron Webb, an African-American doctor and former White House fellow, routed a handful of white opponents to capture the Democratic nomination in a conservative-leaning district where Republicans just ousted their incumbent, Representative Denver Riggleman, in a nominating convention.

For the most part, though, Tuesday marked the latest example of how the pandemic has turned election night into Election Week.

Absentee ballots in New York are not fully counted until a week after the election. And those ballots could represent about half of all votes cast in the primary.

The race drawing much of the attention in New York was the contest between Representative Eliot L. Engel, the veteran congressman from the Bronx, and Jamaal Bowman, an insurgent candidate backed by many of the Democrats’ most outspoken progressives.

Mr. Engel, fighting for his political life, countered Mr. Bowman by rolling out endorsements from party leaders, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton.

Like Mr. Booker, Mr. Bowman is an African-American attempting to build a multiracial coalition of white liberals and voters of color that could prove formidable if replicated by other nonwhite candidates.

In Kentucky, fewer than 200 polling places were opened on Tuesday, a drastic reduction from the 3,700 locations that are often used in a typical election year. Absentee ballot requests soared in the state’s two largest cities, Louisville and Lexington. Yet a number of jurisdictions have indicated that on Tuesday they will only tabulate votes cast that day, or those cast that day combined with those cast during in-person early voting.

That would mean that potentially hundreds of thousands of absentee votes would not be counted until after Tuesday evening.

Mr. Booker was expected to run up a large margin in Louisville, his hometown and the largest city in the state, so the question was whether Ms. McGrath could overcome that advantage in more rural areas of eastern and western Kentucky.

Working in her favor is the nature of voting in the coronavirus age: Ms. McGrath banked a number of ballots from voters well before Mr. Booker’s late surge.

Whoever wins the Senate primary in Kentucky will face an uphill fight against Mr. McConnell in a state President Trump carried by nearly 30 points four years ago.

The contest between Ms. McGrath and Mr. Booker had also become a test of whether national Democratic leaders like Senator Chuck Schumer, who coronated Ms. McGrath last year, can maintain their hold over the party in a moment of growing progressive energy.

Political calculations have been altered in recent weeks as the nation reels from protests that erupted following the George Floyd killing in Minneapolis on Memorial Day. The intensity of those demonstrations, and calls for a national debate on race and law enforcement, has helped elevate some black candidates.

In a speech to supporters on Tuesday night, Mr. Bowman, a middle-school principal from Yonkers, spoke out against poverty, racism and sexism, among other social ills, “a system that’s literally killing us."" He said, if elected, he would be a “black man with power.”

“That is what Donald Trump is afraid of,” said Mr. Bowman, who held a significant lead over Mr. Engel as early returns rolled in, adding: “I cannot wait to get to Congress and cause problems.”The liberal wave that swept Ms. Ocasio-Cortez into Congress in 2018 has continued to swell in New York, with primary candidates — usually younger, more idealistic, and less prone to to engage in pragmatic politics — emerging to challenge the Democratic establishment.

One after another, other left-wing challengers took on New York incumbents, including Representative Gregory Meeks, the chairman of the Queens Democratic Party; Representative Yvette Clarke, who faced a slew of upstart candidates in Brooklyn; and Representative Carolyn Maloney, who represents parts of three New York City boroughs.

Mr. Meeks won his race, according to the A.P., and Ms. Clarke held a comfortable lead in early returns. But Ms. Maloney was in a tight race with Suraj Patel, who ran against her in 2018.

While Democrats dominated the conversation in New York, two traditionally Republican seats were also drawing interest at opposite ends of the state.

In Long Island, Representative Peter King, the state’s most prominent Republican member of Congress, is retiring, leaving a wide-open race, and Democrats dreaming of a pickup in November.

In Western New York, State Senator Chris Jacobs held a Republican seat, winning a special election to complete the term of Chris Collins, who resigned last fall just before pleading guilty to federal insider trading charges. The Democratic candidate, Nate McMurray, had hoped to flip the deep-red 27th Congressional District, but has, in any case, pledged to fight Mr. Jacobs for a full term in November. President Trump and his son both offered endorsements for Mr. Jacobs in the closing days of the campaign.

Two open House seats — held by retiring Democrats in the lower Hudson Valley and the Bronx — were also being closely watched, with a scrum of candidates in both districts.

In the Hudson Valley district held by Representative Nita Lowey, seven Democrats were in the race, including Mondaire Jones, a Harvard educated lawyer seeking to become the first openly gay black member of Congress. Mr. Jones held a sizable lead late Tuesday.In the Bronx, an even bigger free-for-all was underway in the 15th Congressional District, with a collection of rising Democratic stars and older political veterans seeking to replace the outgoing congressman, José E. Serrano. There, Rubén Díaz Sr., a conservative former state senator with a history of anti-gay remarks, had been considered among the favorites, but was trailing City Councilman Ritchie Torres and Assemblyman Michael A. Blake in early returns. If he emerged victorious, Mr. Torres, too, could be the first openly gay black member of Congress.

Across the state, the pandemic upended the practicalities of electoral democracy: In late April, after the deaths of thousands of New Yorkers, and amid fears of a second wave, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo increased access to absentee voting by mail, resulting in election officials issuing nearly two million ballots to voters statewide. Mr. Cuomo later allowed those ballots to be postmarked as late as Primary Day.

The sheer number of absentee ballots to be counted could prove daunting to election officials, especially considering the fraught and fractious battles over vote counts even before the coronavirus, like last year’s contested election for district attorney in Queens.

Before voting began on Tuesday morning, New York City officials were warning that some polling sites could open late because of overnight subway closures. Still there were only scattered reports of problems at some poll locations in the city.

In Kentucky, fears of long lines in Louisville, which only had one polling location, did not come true.

But a largely smooth day of voting there turned more problematic as polls closed; voters complained of traffic getting into the city’s sole polling location, preventing them from getting in line on time.

The Booker campaign filed a petition with a local judge, as voters crowded the locked doors of the Expo Center and pounded on the glass windows. Eventually, a judge ruled that the doors could be reopened and voters who had been caught in traffic could vote. The center began breaking down its voting equipment roughly an hour later.

The state’s second-largest city, Lexington, was plagued by waits of up to two hours at the University of Kentucky’s football stadium. In-person turnout exceeded the predictions of local election officials, and the check-in process at the stadium had created a bottleneck that lead to the longer lines.

By early afternoon, though, county officials added more check-in options and the lines shrunk considerably. But the mass consolidation of polling places concerned some activists about the potential for a similar setup in November.

George Floyd Updates: 10th Night of Protest Follows Somber Memorial,"A somber and defiant memorial for George Floyd in Minneapolis gave way to a 10th night of protests on Thursday as thousands of demonstrators again poured into the nation’s streets, crowding outside City Hall in Seattle and marching across the Brooklyn Bridge.

The Rev. Al Sharpton, who gave a eulogy for Mr. Floyd, pledged that his death would be a catalyst for change, after video showed a white police officer kneeling on Mr. Floyd’s neck for almost nine minutes as he lay face down and handcuffed on the pavement, saying “I can’t breathe.”

The tragedy, Mr. Sharpton said, was also a symbolic message: “Get your knee off our necks.”

Singing: “Praise God. Ohhh praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God because he’ll praise you.” “I love my brother, man, we had so many memories, you know, together. He was powerful, man, he had a way with words. He could always make you ready to jump and go, all the time. Everybody loved George.” “For those that have agendas that are not about justice, this family will not let you use George as a prop. What happened to Floyd happens every day in this country, in education, in health services and in every area of American life. It’s time for us to stand up in George’s name and say, ‘Get your knee off our necks.’”

The tone at many protests on Thursday was largely mournful, after more than a week of crowds burning with grief and anger over the deaths of Mr. Floyd and other black Americans that have spurred calls for criminal justice reform.

Fueling the anguish on Thursday, an investigator in the death of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was fatally shot while being chased by three white men in suburban Georgia, said one of the suspects had used a racial slur after the shooting.

The developments came as officials from Louisville, Ky., to Seattle have been lifting nightly curfews, after protests there had become largely peaceful in recent days.

New York: The police cornered and arrested dozens of peaceful protesters in Manhattan and the Bronx who were violating the city’s curfew. Earlier in the day, thousands of demonstrators had also gathered in Brooklyn and outside the mayor’s mansion on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. [Follow our live coverage of the protests in New York.]

Minneapolis: Two City Council members said they planned to significantly alter the city’s Police Department after the killing of Mr. Floyd. Council members plan to vote Friday on a temporary restraining order against the department that would require immediate changes, although they were still hammering out the details Thursday. The two council members, including the City Council president, said on Twitter that they hope longer-term changes will effectively “dismantle” the current department.

Nashville: The Black Lives Matter movement held a protest at the Bicentennial Mall. Demonstrators marched to the National Museum of African American Music, which is scheduled to open this year, before the procession made its way to the State Capitol.

Boston: In Jamaica Plain, a silent vigil was held to protest racial injustice. The city’s mayor, Marty Walsh, led a moment of silence for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, which was how long a Minneapolis police officer charged in the killing of George Floyd kept his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck.

Asheville, N.C.: The city’s police chief, David Zack, apologized after officers in riot gear destroyed a medical station at the site of a protest this week. A video widely circulated on social media showed the officers stomping on water bottles and ransacking the triage station. Chief Zack called the episode an embarrassment, saying, “For these actions, I am truly sorry.”

Washington: Mayor Muriel Bowser said there would be no curfew on Thursday night, despite President Trump encouraging shows of force from the military and law enforcement to crack down on protesters. And the U.S. ambassador to India, Ken Juster, apologized after a statue of Mohandas K. Gandhi, who is a symbol of peaceful resistance, was vandalized with graffiti outside the Indian Embassy.

Santa Monica, Calif.: In Los Angeles County, a nightly curfew that had been widely criticized was lifted on Thursday. The decision came after more than 3,000 people had been arrested in the nation’s second-largest city since the protests began last week. Most of the arrests were for curfew violations, with offenders issued citations and released. There were demonstrations in several places in the county, including Santa Monica.

Salt Lake City: A man who pointed a bow and arrow at demonstrators and brandished a knife during a protest last week was charged with two felony weapons counts and one count of aggravated assault, the county’s district attorney said. The man, Brandon McCormick, drove his car into the crowd and said, “Yes, I’m American. All lives matter,” a video of the altercation showed. The crowd beat him up and set his car ablaze.

“Move back!” “Hey!” [gasps] “He is bleeding!” “Bleeding out his ears, bleeding out of his ears.” “Call a medic! Call a medic!” “He’s bleeding out of his ear.” “Get a medic.” “What the [expletive] you walking up on me?” [unclear] “Oh [expletive].” “Back up. Back up. Get off the steps, let’s go, get back. Get back!” “Better get an ambulance for him.” “He’s — there — we have EMT on scene.”

Two Buffalo police officers were suspended without pay on Thursday night after a video showed them shoving a 75-year-old protester, who was hospitalized with a head injury, the authorities said.

Mayor Byron Brown said the man was in serious but stable condition. A video showed the man motionless on the ground and bleeding from his right ear.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York condemned the actions of the officers in a statement late Thursday night.

“The incident in Buffalo is wholly unjustified and utterly disgraceful,” Mr. Cuomo said. “I’ve spoken with City of Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown and we agree that the officers involved should be immediately suspended. Police officers must enforce — NOT ABUSE — the law.”

“It sickens me,” the Erie County executive, Mark Poloncarz, wrote on Twitter about what the video posted by the radio station WBFO shows. It includes both vulgarity and disturbing images.

In the video, an officer who pushed the man appeared to start to check on him but was nudged to leave by another officer. Someone could be overheard saying, “Get a medic, right now.”

The Police Department initially told local media that “one person was injured when he tripped and fell” and that there were five arrests during the protest.

The mayor, Mr. Brown, said in a statement that he was disturbed by the episode and that the city’s police commissioner had ordered an immediate investigation.

“After days of peaceful protests and several meetings between myself, police leadership and members of the community, tonight’s event is disheartening,” he said.

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. told a group of black supporters on Thursday night that most Americans are good people who think the nation can be improved, but also declared that “there are probably anywhere from 10 to 15 percent of the people out there that are just not very good people.”

“The words a president says matter, so when a president stands up and divides people all the time, you’re going to get the worst of us to come out,” Mr. Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said during an online round table hosted by the actor Don Cheadle. “Do we really think this is as good as we can be as a nation? I don’t think the vast majority of people think that.”

Several times during his 70-minute conversation, Mr. Biden acknowledged that he did not know what it was like to be discriminated against on the basis of race, and that his election would not guarantee an end to systemic racism.

“Hate didn’t begin with Donald Trump; it’s not going to end with him,” Mr. Biden said. “The history of our country is not a fairy tale. It doesn’t guarantee a happy ending. But, as I said earlier, we’re in a battle for the soul of this country. It’s been a constant push and pull for the last 200 years.”

Mr. Biden also admitted that he had misjudged the amount of progress the nation had made on race.

“I thought we had made enormous progress when we elected an African-American president. I thought things had really changed,” he said. “I thought you could defeat hate, you could kill hate. But the point is, you can’t. Hate only hides, and if you breathe any oxygen into that hate, it comes alive again.”

When George Floyd heard banging on the car window, he was startled, but knew immediately how he should respond.

“What do you want me to do, officer?” he said calmly, according to a friend who was sitting in the passenger seat of his car on May 25 as the fatal encounter with the police began.

The officer answered, “Show me your hands.”

The friend, Maurice Hall, said he had observed Mr. Floyd interact with police officers before. Known as a “gentle giant,” Mr. Floyd was always able to defuse the situation, Mr. Hall said in an interview with Erica L. Green on Wednesday. This time seemed to be different.

“When they approached, they approached with aggression,” Mr. Hall said of the Minneapolis police officers.

Mr. Hall was interviewed this week by Minnesota investigators as a key witness in the state’s case against the four officers charged in Mr. Floyd’s death.

Mr. Hall said he and Mr. Floyd were in the car shortly after they left the store — where Mr. Floyd had been accused of paying for merchandise with a counterfeit $20 bill — when two officers approached, one on each side of the car.

Mr. Floyd complied with the instruction to show his hands, Mr. Hall said, but an officer started reaching into the car to grab them, prompting Mr. Floyd to ask why.

“Now what are you doing that for?” Mr. Hall recalled Mr. Floyd saying. “You asked to see my hands.”

The officer who was on Mr. Hall’s side of the car quickly made his way to Mr. Floyd’s side. “Floyd was not fighting, he’s just shifting from them tussling on him,” Mr. Hall said.

During Mr. Floyd’s arrest, Mr. Hall said he could hear his friend’s cries: “Please officer. I’ve been shot before.” From across the street, he could see his friend’s feet squirming.

“He was just crying out at that time for anyone to help because he was dying,” Mr. Hall said. “He could feel it.”

A protest movement that was ignited by a horrific video of police violence — a white police officer pressing his knee against the neck of Mr. Floyd for nearly nine minutes — has now prompted hundreds of other episodes and videos documenting cases of violent police tactics.

Often captured by bystanders and sometimes broadcast on live TV — a compilation of videotaped incidents posted on Twitter by a North Carolina lawyer stood at 281 clips by Thursday evening — the violent incidents have occurred in cities large and small, in the heat of mass protests and in their quiet aftermath.

In California, an officer sitting in a police car fatally shot a 22-year-old man who was on his knees with his hands up. In Texas, a 20-year-old protester was shot in the head by police officers in Austin aiming at someone else with nonlethal beanbag ammunition. He was left with brain damage and a fractured skull. In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Miami Herald reporters filmed officers shooting a nonviolent protester in the head with foam rubber bullets, fracturing her eye socket and leaving her screaming and bloody. In Kansas City, Mo., the police walked onto a sidewalk to use pepper spray on protesters yelling at them.

To those protesting police violence, the violence adds up to confirmation of their basic premise: that officers too willingly used excessive force. Experts on policing said that the videos showed, in many cases, examples of abrupt escalation on the part of law enforcement that was difficult to justify.

“It feels like the police are being challenged in ways that they haven’t been challenged in some time,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum. “They are responding. And sometimes, that response is totally inappropriate.”

President Trump agreed on Thursday to begin sending home 82nd Airborne Division troops he had ordered to Washington, temporarily easing a contentious standoff with the Pentagon over the role of the armed forces in quelling protests that have broken out across the nation.

None of the active-duty forces ever actually deployed in Washington, instead remaining on alert outside the city while National Guard troops took up position near the White House and elsewhere around town. But they became caught up in a confrontation pitting a commander in chief intent on demonstrating strength in the face of street demonstrations versus a military command resistant to being drawn into domestic law enforcement or election year politics.

Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper initially tried to send home a small portion of the 1,600 active-duty troops on Wednesday, only to have Mr. Trump order him to reverse course during an angry meeting. The president finally acquiesced on Thursday, according to an administration official who asked not to be named discussing internal deliberations, but it did not appear the two men spoke directly.

Mr. Esper ordered 700 airborne soldiers to head back to Fort Bragg, N.C., by evening and a Pentagon official said the remaining 900 soldiers from the division as well as a military police unit from Fort Drum, N.Y., could begin withdrawing as early as Friday. More than 2,000 National Guard forces remain in Washington, a number set to climb to 4,500.

Protesters returned to the White House on Thursday to find that National Guard units that had established a perimeter blocks away had pulled back, allowing the crowds all the way up to the northern edge of Lafayette Square once again, at least during daylight. But the government fortified the square, adding concrete barriers behind chain-link fences installed earlier in the week and extending the fences farther around the White House.

What appeared on Thursday to be an uneasy truce between the White House and Pentagon did not mean that the conflict was over. While Mr. Trump’s advisers counseled him not to fire Mr. Esper, the president spent much of the day privately railing about the defense secretary, who along with Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, opposed the president’s desire to send regular troops into the nation’s cities.

Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska on Thursday became the first Republican senator to say she was considering not voting for President Trump, as she endorsed scathing criticism of the president by James Mattis, the former defense secretary.

Ms. Murkowski said the critique by Mr. Mattis on Wednesday, in which he said that Mr. Trump had divided the nation and failed to lead, was overdue and might be a tipping point that would cause Republicans to air concerns about the president that they had only spoken about privately.

Some Republican lawmakers have found fault with the president’s handling of the unrest convulsing the nation, but Ms. Murkowski was the most explicit so far in her support for the comments by Mr. Mattis, a former four-star Marine Corps general.

“I was really thankful,” Ms. Murkowski told reporters on Capitol Hill. “I thought General Mattis’s words were true and honest and necessary and overdue.”

Ms. Murkowski, one of the few Republicans in Congress who has been willing to break publicly with Mr. Trump, added that when she saw the Mattis statement, “I felt like perhaps we’re getting to the point where we can be more honest with the concerns that we might hold internally, and have the courage of our own convictions to speak up.”

Asked whether she could still support Mr. Trump in the coming election, Ms. Murkowski said: “I am struggling with it. I have struggled with it for a long time.”

In his statement, Mr. Mattis said: “Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people — does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership.”

Three former Minneapolis police officers charged with aiding in George Floyd’s death made a brief appearance in court on Thursday afternoon, in a first public appearance since protests seized the nation.

The officers, Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao, appeared one at a time, wearing masks because of coronavirus concerns. Amid protests and high national tensions, attorneys for the defendants entered the courtroom via a corridor flanked by National Guard soldiers and Hennepin County Sheriff’s Deputies.

A Hennepin County district judge, Paul R. Scoggin, considered and denied requests for reduced bail, which was set at $750,000 each with certain conditions.

The officers were charged on Wednesday with aiding and abetting second-degree murder, as well as aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. A fourth former officer who was seen on video holding Mr. Floyd down, Derek Chauvin, faces a charge of second-degree murder, as well as second-degree manslaughter.

All four officers were fired after video emerged of the May 25 arrest that led to the killing.

Mr. Chauvin, who is white, held his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Mr. Lane held his legs and Mr. Kueng held his back, while Mr. Thao stood by, according to video footage of the encounter.

Mr. Lane is white and Mr. Thao is Hmong, according to a spokesman for the Minnesota attorney general. Mr. Kueng is black, according to his defense lawyer.

The hearing and 235 pages of personnel records released by the Minneapolis Police Department late Wednesday revealed the varying histories of the four officers, and lawyers sought to paint a contrast between Mr. Lane and Mr. Kueng, who were new to the force, and Mr. Chauvin, who had been with the Minneapolis Police Department for nearly two decades.

Lawyers for Mr. Lane and Mr. Kueng said they had only been full members of the police department for a matter of days when they got the call about Mr. Floyd, and that they had raised flags multiple times during the arrest while also looking to Mr. Chauvin for guidance.

A defense lawyer said Mr. Lane performed CPR on Mr. Floyd in the ambulance “for a lengthy period of time.”

Mr. Chauvin, 44, was the subject of at least 17 misconduct complaints over two decades, though only one was detailed in 79 pages of his heavily redacted personnel file.

A woman complained in 2007 that he needlessly removed her from her car, searched her and put her into the back of a squad car for driving 10 miles an hour over the speed limit. The file shows that the complaint was upheld and that Mr. Chauvin was issued a letter of reprimand.

The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its handling of protests near the White House, calling aggressive efforts to disperse those gathered a violation of their Constitutional rights.

The lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court names President Donald Trump, Attorney General William P. Barr and other administration officials. Scott Michelman, the legal director for the A.C.L.U. of the District of Columbia, said the tactics employed with the blessing of the nation’s top law enforcement official “chills protected speech for all of us.”

“The President’s shameless, unconstitutional, unprovoked, and frankly criminal attack on protesters — because he disagreed with their views — shakes the foundation of our nation’s constitutional order,” Mr. Michelman said.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Black Lives Matter D.C. as well as individual protesters who were at Lafayette Square.

On Monday, federal agents using smoke, flash grenades and chemical spray abruptly dispersed protesters and clergy members who had gathered peacefully near the White House. Mr. Trump and aides then held a photo op in front of a historic church.

The A.C.L.U. said it also planned to file many other lawsuits around the country in response to law enforcement tactics used against protesters.

A Georgia investigator testified on Thursday that one of the three defendants accused of chasing down and killing Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was jogging in Brunswick, Ga., heard another defendant use a racist slur after shooting Mr. Arbery.

At a preliminary hearing in the case, the investigator said that William Bryan, who used his cellphone to film the fatal encounter, heard the remark by Travis McMichael, the man who pulled the trigger.

From the witness stand, Richard Dial, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation assistant special agent in charge of the case, said that Mr. Bryan heard Mr. McMichael use the slur after the shooting took place, and before the police arrived on the scene.

The death of Mr. Arbery in February drew widespread condemnation that only intensified after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. His name has become one of several that protesters have repeated in recent days, urging attention to the issue of systemic racism and criminal justice reform in nationwide demonstrations.

The hearing ended with Judge Wallace E. Harrell of the Glynn County Magistrate Court determining that sufficient probable cause existed to support the murder charges brought against the three men.

Gregory McMichael, a retired investigator in the local district attorney’s office, and his son, Travis McMichael, were arrested May 7. Each was charged with murder and aggravated assault. They had pursued Mr. Arbery through their Satilla Shores neighborhood on the afternoon of Feb. 23, suspecting him of being the perpetrator of a number of neighborhood break-ins.

Travis McMichael, 34, who was armed with a shotgun, shot Mr. Arbery three times as the two men scuffled. Greg McMichael, 64, who had armed himself with a handgun, watched the shooting while standing in the bed of a pickup truck.

Their neighbor, William Bryan, 50, made a video recording of the incident on his phone. He was arrested May 21 on charges of felony murder and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment. In a police report, Greg McMichael appears to indicate that Mr. Bryan, who goes by “Roddie,” was a participant in the chase, telling an officer that Mr. Bryan “attempted to block” Mr. Arbery as he ran.

The three men remain in Glynn County jail and have not yet entered a plea in the case.

Democrats in Congress are “on the brink” of unveiling legislation to address police brutality, racial profiling and the loss of trust between the police and their communities, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday.

Ms. Pelosi said the Congressional Black Caucus planned to unveil the bills on Monday that would go beyond the kind of incremental changes considered by Congress in the past. She called the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis “a threshold that our country has crossed,” and predicted that the debate could help push the country forward in meaningful ways.

“We want to see this as a time where we can go forward in a very drastic way,” she told reporters. “Not incrementally, but in an important way to address those problems.”

Ms. Pelosi declined to detail what would be included in the package, but Democrats have previously indicated they would try to outlaw chokeholds, set up a federal commission on the social status of black men, and make it easier to track violent officers as they move from department to department.

Senate Republicans pledged to act, as well, though they were on a slower track and are likely to pursue narrower solutions than those the Democrats will propose.

Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said Thursday that he would convene a hearing on June 16 on race and law enforcement, aimed at finding “better policing methods.”

“I’m willing to spend a lot of money to get the system to engage in better policing,” Mr. Graham said. “I’m willing to make it easier to fire bad cops who shouldn’t be wearing the uniform to begin with. Count me in for solutions.”

Meanwhile, on the Senate floor, a Republican blocked a move by two Democratic senators, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, to push through legislation that would make lynching a federal crime.

The bill overwhelmingly passed the House earlier this year, but Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky has insisted on trying to make changes, and refused on Thursday to allow it to pass without a formal vote.

Following Mr. Floyd’s somber memorial service in Minneapolis on Thursday, the Rev. Al Sharpton, who delivered the eulogy, announced a march on Washington on Aug. 28, to demand a federal law against discriminatory policing, led by family members of Mr. Floyd, Eric Garner and other black people who have died in police custody.

The date is the anniversary of the 1963 civil rights march that culminated in the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I have a dream” speech.

Attorney General William P. Barr pushed back on Thursday against the widespread condemnation of President Trump’s photo opportunity in front of a historic church earlier this week, and the forcible clearing of protesters just before Mr. Trump’s appearance.

“The president is the head of the executive branch and the chief executive of the nation, and should be able to walk outside the White House, and walk across the street to visit the church,” Mr. Barr said at a news conference with other top Justice Department officials.

“I don’t necessarily view that as a political act,” he said. “I think it was entirely appropriate.”

In the minutes before Mr. Trump strode from the White House on Monday evening and crossed Lafayette Park, to pose for a photo in front of St. John’s Church, officers in riot gear rushed to move people out of his path using smoke, flash grenades and chemical spray.

Mr. Barr denied any link between Mr. Trump’s visit to the church and the authorities’ violent clearing of protesters, saying that well before he knew that Mr. Trump intended to visit the church, he had asked that the park be cleared in order to create more space between the White House and the protests.

“There was no correlation between our tactical plan of moving the perimeter out by one block and the president’s going over to the church,” he said.

The demonstrators in the park on Monday night were peaceful.

But Mr. Barr and other department officials said the decision had been made earlier that day to increase the law enforcement presence in and around the park, in response to looters, vandals and others who committed violent acts over the three previous nights, during weekend protests over the killing of George Floyd.

The officials stressed that most of the protesters were peaceful, and attributed much of the illegal activity over the weekend to extremist groups intent on sowing chaos.

Mr. Barr mentioned antifa, a loose collective of anti-fascists associated with the left, and the similarly loosely organized “boogaloo” movement of people on the far right who hope to touch off a race war. “It’s important to point out the witch’s brew that we have of extremist individuals and groups that are involved,” Mr. Barr said. “There were a variety of people, a variety of ideological persuasions.”

Justin Howell was not the demonstrator who threw a water bottle on Sunday at officers guarding police headquarters, Chief Brian Manley of the Austin police said. It was not Mr. Howell, but someone next to him, who then hurled a backpack toward the officers, the chief said.

But as officers responded with force, it was Mr. Howell, 20, a student studying political science at Texas State University, who was struck in the head with a bean bag round fired by the police. Mr. Howell was critically injured.

The encounter is expected to be discussed at an Austin City Council hearing on Thursday afternoon about the actions of the police during the protests.

In an article published Wednesday in The Battalion, the student newspaper of Texas A&M University, Mr. Howell’s brother Joshua Howell wrote that Justin, who is black, sustained a skull fracture and brain damage and that doctors said he would probably not recover quickly.

“These ‘less-lethal’ munitions are only ‘less-lethal’ by technicality,” Joshua Howell, who is the opinion editor of the newspaper, wrote. “My brother’s condition shows what can happen when you fire them into a crowd.”

Saying the police in Austin were “entirely out of their depth,” Joshua Howell wrote that when people carried his brother’s limp body to the headquarters building for medical help, the police fired at them, too — as they had been told to do by other officers — a sequence of events that Chief Manley said on Monday was under investigation.

“At minimum, it shows a complete inability to be aware of your surroundings and to manage the situation appropriately,” Joshua Howell wrote.

Talking to Kids About Racism,"Good morning.

(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)

The protests in response to the killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor have elicited questions from children of all ages, and many parents are left wondering how to respond.

Children are like sponges. They soak up news headlines and images of unrest on TV and social media. They may also be keenly attuned to conversations about current events happening at home. Parents and educators alike (and those of us now wearing both hats) should address questions about racism that arise and maintain an open dialogue with children.

To help navigate the best way to do this, I asked Christiana Cobb-Dozier, a school counselor in Los Angeles, and Christian Robinson, a Sacramento-based author and illustrator of children’s books, about how to talk to children about racism.

Here’s what they said:

1) All parents should talk to their children about racism. “We don’t talk about race and disparities and inequity enough,” said Ms. Cobb-Dozier. Too often, the burden of talking about race falls to the parents of black children.

Mr. Robinson, who grew up in Los Angeles, said that as a black child, race was always talked about in his family. “I wouldn’t even call it a topic of discussion, it was just discussion,” he said.

“We should all be having conversations with our children that the color of your skin in this country, specifically, will dictate your experiences in the world,” Ms. Cobb-Dozier said.

There are ways to broach the topic of race with children at every developmental level, even with kids as young as 2. It’s important to follow their lead. If children approach their parents ready to talk about race, it’s a good sign that they are ready to talk about it. “If they’re asking about it, they’re ready to know about it,” Ms. Cobb-Dozier said.

2) Be honest with yourself and with your children. When talking about racism, it’s important for parents to also check their own thoughts for biases, unconscious or not.

One way of rooting out unconscious biases, Mr. Robinson said, is to use the power of imagination, an idea he heard while giving a talk with the founders of Abundant Beginnings, a school in Oakland.

“Imagine that for some people, there’s a fairy that lands on your shoulder. And that fairy is called racism,” he said. “And it will say something from time to time in your ear, like, ‘Don’t trust that person,’ ‘You should cross the street,’ ‘You should be afraid.’ You got to recognize these things as thoughts. And I think that’s a good practice for young people to be working on.”

3) Have diverse books around for children to read. Ms. Cobb-Dozier, who is black, talked about the experience of having two black godchildren. She said, “I’m constantly sending them affirmation coloring books or poems that will remind them as they are growing up about the beauty of who they are and the resiliency of their people.”

She recommends the following books: “Black Is a Rainbow Color,” “Last Stop on Market Street,” “Each Kindness” and “Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You.”

[These books can also help explain racism and protest to your kids.]

4) Allow for questions even when you don’t know the answers. You may not have the answers to questions like, “Why is this happening?,” but it’s important to hold space for them and explain how you feel, nonetheless.

“Brace yourself. Be ready for their response and just be with them,” Ms. Cobb-Dozier said. “If they’re crying, hold them and tell them you’re sad, too.”

Every Sunday on Instagram and YouTube, Mr. Robinson posts a new “Making Space” video, a personal project he started during the pandemic as an outlet for creativity. Each episode features a theme with the most recent one being anger. It’s his way of encouraging creativity in children, too. “Creativity was the thing that got me through a lot of hardships and helped me process the world around me,” he said. “Children may not have much control over the world around them, but they can have some say over the world they create on the page with their imaginations.”

5) If speaking with black children, let them know their lives matter and encourage their whole identity.

The message of Mr. Robinson’s latest book, “You Matter,” is one his grandmother, who raised Mr. Robinson, his older brother and two cousins in a one-bedroom home, instilled in him from an early age. Drawing became a way for him to make space for himself and to create the kind of world he wanted to see.

The message he wants to send to young people, he said, is simple.

“Your life doesn’t matter just because of how big or important you are. It’s not about how great your grades are or how many trophies you won. You matter just because you exist. Because you’re here.”

Tear Gas Clears Path for Trump to Visit Church,"[Follow our live coverage of the George Floyd protests.]

In his first remarks from the White House since massive protests have swept the country, President Trump said Monday evening that the looting and violent demonstrations in reaction to the death of George Floyd in police custody were “acts of domestic terror.” 

Speaking in the Rose Garden as protesters and law enforcement held a tense standoff outside, Mr. Trump said he planned for a police and law enforcement presence to “dominate the streets” and said he would respond with an “overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled.”

Mr. Trump said he was among the Americans “rightly sickened and revolted” by the death of Mr. Floyd. But, he said, “If a city or state refuses to take the actions necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,” he said.

Just after Mr. Trump concluded his speech, military police from the National Guard clad in camouflage and riot shields surged in front of a line of law enforcement officers pushing protesters back from the mouth of Lafayette Square outside the White House.

Police officers used tear gas and flash grenades to clear out the crowd so Mr. Trump could visit the nearby St. John’s Church, where there had been a parish house basement fire Sunday night. The president stood in front of the boarded up church posing for photographs with a Bible, after the police dispersed peaceful protesters. 

Mr. Trump walked back to the White House after a few minutes. 

The president’s church visit was criticized by Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, who said she was “outraged” that Mr. Trump went to the church “after he threatened to basically rain down military force.” 

“The president used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese, without even asking us, as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,” she said in an interview. 

Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington said the federal police officers’ clearing of peaceful protesters was “shameful” and had made the job of city police officers harder. Libby Garvey, the chair of the Arlington County Board in Virginia, said the county had ordered its police force — which had been helping to patrol the protests in Washington — to return, saying their mutual aid agreement had been “abused.”

Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump had berated America’s governors over their response to the protests across the nation, calling the protesters “terrorists,” demanding “retribution,” and warning the governors that they will look like “jerks” if they don’t order protesters arrested and imprisoned. 

Tens of thousands of protesters began another week of demonstrations and disturbances on Monday night, returning to the streets of cities around the country despite curfew orders, threats of arrest and the words of the brother of George Floyd, who made an emotional plea for the destruction to end. 

The protesters were driven from parks, interstates and government buildings by growing numbers of law enforcement officers in riot gear, whose response to the demonstrations has been criticized in a dozens of confrontations. 

In Washington, President Trump threatened to call in the military to end protests around the country and then ventured outside the White House grounds to pose for photographs at a nearby church. His walk came after riot police and National Guard troops used tear gas and flash grenades to clear a path through a peaceful protest in a city park.

In New York, a curfew implemented by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo that extended from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. did little to deter protesters and looters, who made their way into the iconic Macy’s department store in Manhattan. 

In St. Louis, Mo., four police officers were struck by gunfire during a lengthy shootout that took place amid the protests, the department said.

The driver of an S.U.V. sped through a line of law enforcement officers in riot gear in Buffalo, injuring two of them in an episode that was caught on video. One of the injured was a Buffalo police officer, and the other was a member of the New York State Police, according to Mark Poloncarz, the Erie County executive, who said that both officers were in stable condition. The driver and the passengers in the S.U.V. were taken into custody.

In Philadelphia, an armored vehicle bearing the insignia of the Pennsylvania State Police fired tear gas into hundreds of protesters who had gathered near downtown. Demonstrators sought refuge along a highway embankment after they had breached the roadway. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, is slated to visit the city on Tuesday to address the unrest.

In Dallas, protesters were arrested and charged with obstruction of a highway for marching on the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge. Clay Jenkins, the Dallas County Judge, allowed peaceful protests to continue on the county courthouse property past a citywide 7 p.m. curfew. He cautioned that protesters would likely be arrested by Dallas police officers if they left the property. “I support peaceful protest and radical transformation,” he said.

In Minneapolis, Terrence Floyd became the first member of George Floyd’s family to visit the place where his brother lived his last conscious moments and told a crowd that what he had seen in recent days troubled him. “If I’m not over here wilding out, if I’m not over here blowing up stuff, if I’m not over here messing up my community, then what are y’all doing? What are y’all doing?” he said. About 15 minutes after curfew, a peaceful crowd gathered at the spot saw flashing lights in the distance and ran toward them, saying they wouldn’t back down from the police, and barricaded the nearby streets.

The mayor of Louisville, Ky., fired the city’s police chief after the owner of a local barbecue restaurant was killed when police officers and National Guard troops shot toward protesters. The mayor, Greg Fischer, said he had fired the chief after learning that officers’ body cameras were not activated during the shooting. 

A white bar owner in Omaha who fatally shot a young black man amid rioting acted in self-defense, a prosecutor said on Monday, announcing that no charges would be filed. The bar owner, Jake Gardner, shot James Scurlock, 22, on Saturday night, in an area of downtown Omaha where businesses had been vandalized. The announcement prompted many employers in Omaha, which is already under a curfew, to send people home early for fear of renewed violence. 

A vigil in Puerto Rico brought hundreds of people to Loíza, the island’s largest black community, before a 7 p.m. curfew in place to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. “We share the grief of all the African-American community,” said one of the protesters, Andrés Santos, 41. “We share the rage.”

In Chicago, the Justice Department arrested a man it accused of traveling across state lines to start riots, loot and attack law enforcement officers. The man, Matthew Lee Rupert, 28, was arrested after he visited Minneapolis and, according to the complaint, posted a video of himself on social media in which he could be seen setting fire to a store, looting another store and distributing explosives to others and encouraging them to attack police officers. 

In Austin, Texas, the police chief said that an African-American protester who was shot in the head by officers was in critical condition at a hospital, one of a handful of cases in the city of protesters being injured by nonlethal rounds.

Seattle issued its third night of curfews on Monday night, and the city’s suburbs prepared for the possibility that further unrest could spread. Bellevue, Redmond, Issaquah, Lynnwood, Tukwila and Renton were among those that were to begin curfews on Monday night. The National Guard arrived in Bellevue as crews cleaned up from looting and vandalism the day before.

Protests have erupted in at least 140 cities across the United States in the days after George Floyd, a black man, died in police custody. Some of the demonstrations have turned violent, prompting the activation of the National Guard in at least 21 states.

Protests and looting continued past an 11 p.m. curfew in New York, as the police warned they would “start making arrests” for those who remained on the streets. Earlier in the night, some of Manhattan’s most iconic retail stores were ransacked. 

After thousands of demonstrators fanned across New York City on Sunday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said the city would be put under a curfew, beginning at 11 p.m. on Monday and ending at 5 a.m., and that the number of police officers deployed would double, to 8,000. 

But hours before the curfew took effect, looters broke into the Macy’s flagship store in Herald Square and a number of luxury stores along Fifth Avenue. An Anthropologie and Aldo store were targeted, and a Nike store, New York Yankees store and two Rolex watch shops, among several others, were ransacked. 

Mayor Bill de Blasio, acknowledging that the Monday night curfew failed to curtail the criminal violence that marred otherwise peaceful protests, said Tuesday night’s curfew would begin at 8 p.m., three hours earlier. 

Curfews were imposed in dozens of U.S. cities over the weekend, but the tactic was particularly striking for New York City’s eight million residents, who have been under severe lockdown orders because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed thousands of city residents. Just as the city was getting ready to cautiously reopen on June 8, the protests injected a new factor of unease, coming with not only police confrontations and widespread looting, but also fears that the virus was spreading in the crowds. 

Mr. de Blasio also walked back earlier comments that appeared to criticize protesters who were rammed with police vehicles during a protest in Brooklyn, in an encounter captured on video that was shared widely over the weekend. 

Mr. de Blasio, who was first elected to office on a platform of police reform, had drawn heavy criticism for his earlier remarks, in which he called for an investigation but also seemed to blame protesters.

“There is no situation where a police vehicle should drive into a crowd of protesters or New Yorkers,” Mr. de Blasio said during a news conference on Monday.

Family members of David McAtee prayed near the site in Louisville, Ky., where he was shot and killed shortly after midnight Sunday. Mr. McAtee, a restaurant owner, was killed in a shooting involving police officers and National Guard troops. 

Residents and business owners cleaned up on Monday in Santa Monica, Calif., where National Guard troops were posted after heavy looting on Sunday night.

An Army Black Hawk helicopter descended to rooftop level in the Chinatown district of Washington on Monday night, kicking up dirt, debris and snapping trees that narrowly missed several people.

The military also used Lakota helicopters to perform the maneuver, known as show of force, which is often conducted by low-flying jets in combat zones to scare away insurgents. The crowd quickly dispersed into surrounding blocks. Minutes later, the Black Hawk returned for another pass.

The nation’s capital, roiled by protest, is the one jurisdiction where the Army can deploy without needing approval from a governor. So President Trump, declaring that “the destruction of peaceful life and the spilling of blood is against humanity and God,” ordered the Army to deploy an active-duty military police battalion for Washington, Defense Department officials said Monday.

The deployment of the military police unit — some 200 to 500 troops, from Fort Bragg, N.C. — is a sharp escalation in the response to riots and protests that have erupted in the capital.

Other jurisdictions have spurned such assistance. Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota declined Mr. Trump’s offer of military police to respond to protests in his state, and other governors followed his lead, instead choosing to rely on their own national guard troops. 

Mr. Trump made clear, Defense officials said, that he wanted the Pentagon to push back forcefully against protests in the nation’s capital. 

Law enforcement officers were targeted in attacks across the United States on Monday night and Tuesday morning, including a shootout in St. Louis, as unrest over police brutality reached a new pitch. 

In St. Louis, four officers were struck by gunfire in a prolonged shootout between gunmen at a protest and the police. The officers were taken to the hospital, and their injuries were believed to be “non-life threatening,” Chief John Hayden of the St. Louis Police Department said at a news conference.

Chief Hayden said that after a peaceful protest of a few thousand people, a smaller group had broken off, intent on causing mayhem. Some in the crowd were armed and “flourishing pistols,” the chief said. Two officers were shot in the leg, one in the foot and one in the arm, he said. 

Elsewhere, police officers were intentionally struck by vehicles.

A New York officer was run over by a black sedan at 12:45 a.m. on Tuesday in the Bronx, according to a police spokesman. The officer was in stable condition on Tuesday morning, the police said.

That episode followed an attack on Monday in Buffalo, N.Y., when an S.U.V. mowed down two officers who were policing a protest. Video appeared to show at least one of the officers going under the vehicle’s wheels. 

The S.U.V. drove around an armored police vehicle and sped off as shots were fired. The authorities said that the officers’ condition was stable and that those in the car had been taken into custody. Police officers 

“It’s been the last straw,” said Janasia Crumpler, 20, at a rally in Washington. “It’s a pandemic. I’m in good health. I came out for those who can’t and people who been marching for 50 years.”

Ms. Crumpler said that like many people her age she first took to social media to give voice to her outrage. But she was compelled to take to the streets by the contrast in the government’s response to armed white demonstrators storming state capitals to protest coronavirus restrictions. 

“It was out of control before when white people were rioting and you called them very good people. And they were rioting about the virus,” Ms. Crumpler said as she walked. 

An American flag burned in the street nearby.

Rebekah Castilaw stood on an island of grass along one of the busiest thoroughfares in Hattiesburg, Miss — a protest of one. 

She had brought a few signs with her, but the one she was holding at the moment just had “Black Lives Matter” handwritten in black marker. As the cars whipped past her, many of them honked. Plenty of people rolled down their windows. Most cheered her on, and some hurled vulgarities.

“I’ll be out here every day,” Ms. Castilaw, a white woman, said from her spot outside the University of Southern Mississippi. “It’s pitiful you don’t see more.”

About 200 people turned out in the suburban Minneapolis community of Maple Grove for a candlelight vigil. Their plan was to stand in silence for eight minutes and 46 seconds, the same amount of time the Minneapolis police officer had his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck. 

But even after the time elapsed, people were still frozen in place for several minutes, with only the sounds of chirping birds and the hum of cars traveling on the freeway behind them. Members of the mostly white crowd included children on scooters and bicycles, and they held fists in the air and carried Black Lives Matter posters as they stood along the freshly cut lawn of the town library’s driveway.

Mary Kriz, leaning against her bicycle, said she was outraged by President Trump’s message Monday about using military force to break up protests.

“It couldn’t be a more wrong solution,” she said. “What we’re hearing from George’s family is they want us to protest peacefully. It’s the worst possible solution.”

John Morrisette, who was clutching a candle and standing beside her nodded and said, “Everybody is looking for peace right now, and war is not the answer.”

As curfew approached in Minneapolis, members of the National Guard appeared to be rolling into position in the part of town where Mr. Floyd was killed. More than half a dozen troops stood outside Chumps Chicken and the Cedar Bar & Grill, flanked by an array of armored vehicles. A few blocks away a convoy of military vehicles and police vehicles with sirens flashing passed down the street.

Just as the sun set and a citywide curfew took effect, a massive gathering marched down the iconic Hollywood and Sunset Boulevards. 

Police officers gave the group a wide berth and things initially seemed peaceful, but soon groups peeled off targeting the Gower Gulch shopping complex, smashing the windows of a kabob restaurant and tearing the plywood barriers from a drugstore and a mobile phone shop.

Then the frenzy began. Men and women wearing masks stormed the stores, their arms heavy with looted goods. 

Officers quickly descended on the scene, but just as quickly, many demonstrators jumped into awaiting vehicles and fled. 

The clashes that have echoed in the streets of at least 140 cities are producing a growing toll, the extent of which is still difficult to quantify. 

At least five people have died, and an untold number more, including protesters and police officers, have been injured. Thousands of people have been arrested, and fires, looting and vandalism have caused millions of dollars in damage to buildings and businesses — a prospect ever more alarming given the economic straits cities and businesses were already facing amid the coronavirus outbreak.

That marches in response to the violent death of George Floyd have themselves ended in injury and death was a contradiction deeply felt by those close to people who have died. “She would not have wanted this act of violence to instigate more violence,” Amy Lynn Hale said of her niece, Italia Kelly, 22, who was shot in her car in a Walmart parking lot in Davenport, Iowa, as she left a demonstration late Sunday night.

In Louisville, the owner of a well-known barbecue business was shot and killed by the authorities. In Omaha, a 22-year-old black man was shot to death by a white bar owner who said he was protecting his property. And in St. Louis, a man was dragged to his death beneath a FedEx truck that was apparently trying to drive away from protesters.

In Austin, Texas, the damage inflicted by the weekend protests constituted yet another anguishing blow to the state’s capitol city, where an economic tailspin started in March with the cancellation of the South by Southwest conference.

On Sixth Street, an internationally famous stretch of downtown bars and restaurants, a number of establishments had already been shuttered before protesters struck the entertainment district over the weekend, breaking windows, spraying graffiti and looting businesses.

“It looks like a war zone,” said Rob Hicks, the 40-year-old owner of the Dirty Dog Bar, which is in the same block as two looted stores. “I’m sure it could be worse but it doesn’t look like home.”

“Number 1, the knee to the neck and the knees to his back both contributed to him not being able to get breath. And what those officers did there, that we see on the video, is the cause of his death, not some underlying unknown health condition. His cause of death, medically, was mechanical asphyxiation. The legal determination is homicide. That is it in a nutshell: The officers killed him based on a knee to his neck for almost nine minutes and two knees on his back compressing his lungs.” “So it’s important that in the legal world we describe this very simply. It’s called a ‘but for’ event — just those two words. But for the sustained pressure on his neck and on his back, George Floyd would be alive. That’s the simple premise here. And that choke and that pressure, which we knew — we know is an illegal maneuver, turned into deadly force.”

Two autopsies released on Monday agreed: George Floyd’s death was a homicide.

But the autopsies, one by a government agency and one by doctors working with the Floyd family, differed over the specific causes of death and whether there were contributing factors beyond the Minneapolis police officer kneeling on his neck.

The Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s office said Mr. Floyd had died of “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.” The medical examiner also cited significant contributing conditions, saying that Mr. Floyd suffered from heart disease, and was high on fentanyl and had recently used methamphetamine at the time of his death.

The coroner’s conclusions differed from the results of a private autopsy commissioned by Mr. Floyd’s family, which was released a few hours earlier. That autopsy said Mr. Floyd died not just because of the Minneapolis police officer’s knee lodged at his neck, but also because of the other officers who helped hold him down.

Dr. Allecia M. Wilson of the University of Michigan and Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner, were hired by Mr. Floyd’s family to help determine his cause of death. Dr. Baden said their autopsy “shows that Mr. Floyd had no underlying medical problem that caused or contributed to his death.”

Derek Chauvin, the former police officer who was seen in a video kneeling on Mr. Floyd’s neck — even after Mr. Floyd lost consciousness — has been charged with third-degree murder. Antonio Romanucci, a lawyer for the family, said that the weight of two other police officers on Mr. Floyd’s back had prevented blood from reaching his brain and air from reaching his lungs.

Chief Medaria Arradondo of the Minneapolis Police Department said in an interview with CNN on Sunday that three former officers who were present when Mr. Chauvin knelt on Mr. Floyd’s neck — and who did not intervene — were complicit in his death.

As the sun set on an extraordinary day of civil unrest across America, the mayor of Birmingham, Ala., ordered the removal of a contentious 115-year-old Confederate statue from a public park.

One day after dozens of protesters targeted the statue, a 52-foot-tall sandstone obelisk in downtown Linn Park, the mayor said it would be removed and taken away, though he would not say where. Some of the protesters spray painted the statue and chipped away at its base. They also tried to topple it with a rope and truck, according to media reports.

A large crane, forklift and flatbed trailer arrived shortly before 8 p.m. Monday, in the final hours of Jefferson Davis Day, the state holiday in Alabama honoring the Confederate leader.

The statue has been at the center of a legal fight between the city and the state’s attorney general’s office, with the city wanting it removed but ultimately losing the battle. Still, Randall Woodfin, the mayor of the majority black city, approved the removal on Monday in defiance of the Alabama Monuments Preservation Act, setting the stage for another showdown.

Attorney General Steve Marshall vowed to file a new civil complaint against the city if the monument was removed. 

Across the country, in at least six states, anger over Mr. Floyd’s death has led to the damaging or defacing of more than a dozen symbols of the Confederacy.

"Trump and de Blasio: ‘Together, at the Wrong Time in History’","During the social unrest and racial awakening of the 1960s and ’70s, the mayor of New York, John V. Lindsay, coined a memorable phrase about his chosen occupation: “the second toughest job in America.” This wasn’t self-indulgence on Lindsay’s part; the complexities of leading New York have sometimes rivaled the challenges of the presidency.

It would follow, then, that during this moment when New York is so central to the crises afflicting the country — as the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak and convulsing with protests related to its long, troubled history of racism in policing — that the president, a New Yorker himself, and the mayor would rise as their predecessors did to lead the country in times of shared despair.

Instead, President Trump and Mayor Bill de Blasio are both diminished as leaders, polarizing and lacking the trust of the people they serve. Far from alleviating tensions, they have each sparked an outpouring of anger from demonstrators in the streets. Rather than using the crisis as an opportunity to speak to people outside their base of political support, they have alienated even their own supporters.

And as leaders at the state and local level all across the country have tried to meet the demands of the moment with bold policy proposals and inspiring messages, observers who have closely followed the careers of both Mr. Trump and Mr. de Blasio said the men seemed like bystanders to the historic events unfolding around them.

“Both of them together, at the wrong time in history, have provided very little leadership,” said George Arzt, a longtime Democratic consultant and former City Hall aide under Mayor Edward I. Koch.

On a national level, that leadership vacuum has been filled by governors — most prominently by a third New Yorker, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo — and a few standout mayors. Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta, for instance, has won praise for speaking movingly about her anxieties over law enforcement as a black mother. And Muriel Bowser of Washington, who has challenged Mr. Trump for using the military to quell demonstrations in the capital, had a major thoroughfare near the White House repainted with the slogan “Black Lives Matter” — a show of defiance that Mr. de Blasio said he would copy.

“I can’t remember,” Mr. Arzt added, “when the leading mayor in the country was not from New York City.”

Though the mayor and the president are politically polar opposites — Mr. Trump a latecomer to the arch-conservatism his administration has pursued and Mr. de Blasio a longtime progressive advocate — they have similar flaws and challenges as leaders.

Neither man has been particularly willing or eager to reflect on their downplaying of the coronavirus early on. Mr. Trump has said he wouldn’t change anything about his administration’s response. Mr. de Blasio has defended actions that critics said made him look indifferent and self-involved, like when he traveled with his security detail from Gracie Mansion in Manhattan to his gym in Brooklyn for one last workout a few hours before businesses across the city would shutter for months because his own administration had determined it was no longer safe for them to operate.

Kevin Sheekey, a senior aide to former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, said the lack of leadership from Washington was putting an even greater burden on local governments and their leaders. “We have these back-to-back crises,” he said, “and they require national responses. But we don’t have an individual in D.C. who can make the best of what he has been given and bring people together, and that’s an enormous problem for us.”

Regarding the national platform Mr. Cuomo has attained with daily briefings, Mr. Sheekey said, “Normally that kind of role is not filled by Albany.”

Both Mr. Trump and Mr. de Blasio have suffered from failing to reach beyond their narrow bases of support, analysts said. Had they broadened their appeal, voters might have more trust in them, said Bruce Gyory, a Democratic consultant and longtime observer of New York politics.

“The irony is that de Blasio, who considered himself the leading progressive, and Trump, who considered himself Mr. Conservative, the leader of a movement, are mirror images of each other,” Mr. Gyory said. “And by never trying to expand their base, they have belittled themselves in the wake of this crisis.”

But now even parts of their base are unhappy. Mr. Trump has been losing support among white evangelicals, the foundation of his political coalition.

And in an affront to Mr. de Blasio, some African-Americans have literally turned their backs on him. At a recent demonstration in Brooklyn honoring George Floyd, the black man whose killing by a Minneapolis police officer sparked nationwide protests, the mayor was heckled and jeered as some in the crowd turned away from him. It was a display of disgust that has been directed at him before — but from police officers who complained that the mayor did not respect them, not progressive New Yorkers who helped put him in office.

In other times of national crisis, the president and the mayor of New York have worked in tandem to create a sense that the fate of the nation and its largest city were closely intertwined. Before the United States entered World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a New Yorker, put Mayor Fiorello La Guardia in charge of the national Office of Civilian Defense, which helped state and local governments prepare for looming conflict.

The Sept. 11 attacks in 2001 made Rudolph W. Giuliani “America’s Mayor,” for a time at least, after his steady and stoic response, first glimpsed by the nation when he emerged from an emergency command center two blocks from the World Trade Center and urged the city to remain calm, his clothes dusted in ash from the fallen south tower.

Mr. Giuliani and President George W. Bush displayed a unified front and became the faces of the recovery, working together to triage the country’s frayed nerves.

The country saw them together when Mr. Bush appeared at Ground Zero on Sept. 14, Mr. Giuliani at his side, and shouted into a bull horn to the emergency responders digging through the rubble. “I can hear you! I can hear you!” Mr. Bush said. “And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.” Mr. Bush’s leadership immediately after the attacks pushed his approval ratings to 90 percent. They remained above 70 percent for another 10 months.

Whatever you thought of their politics as Republicans, historians said, there was a general sense that Mr. Bush and Mr. Giuliani were leading with confidence and steadiness.

“Bush — whether you liked or didn’t like what he did — didn’t lose interest, as our current president seems to have done with Covid,” said John M. Murphy, a scholar of the American presidency at the University of Illinois.

And with Mr. Giuliani, he added, the country saw someone who “bluntly faced the crisis by telling the truth: ‘This is going to be hard, it’s going to take a long time to get out of this, but we’re going to keep working at it.’” By contrast, Mr. Murphy said, “Mayor de Blasio has been absent to us in the rest of the country.”

Mr. Bush and Mr. Trump both had to confront the major crises of their administrations with similarly shaky political standings. But Mr. Bush, who also lost the popular vote in his first election, intentionally sought a unifying approach as he led the country in the weeks after the attacks.

Peter Wehner, a speechwriter for Mr. Bush, recalled how the president understood that he could be more effective if Americans believed their political leadership wasn’t divided.

“After 9/11 this was true across the board. It wasn’t just Giuliani and Bush being in sync. It was Bush and Democrats being in sync that was important,” Mr. Wehner said. And as White House aides debated where Mr. Bush should give his speech on Sept. 20, the president ultimately settled on delivering it before the bipartisan audience of a joint session of Congress.

“It was essential that the country see Democrats and Republicans and the national political leadership come together,” Mr. Wehner said.

Mr. Trump’s public utterances and appearances have been light on appeals to unity and healing. He has yet to visit New York City — where he was born and lived nearly all of his life before switching his residency to Florida last year — since the pandemic hit, claiming the lives of more than 30,000 people so far, the highest by far of anywhere in the country. He blamed the Secret Service for not allowing him to go. He has not held anything like a memorial service to honor the more than 116,000 people in the United States who have died from the virus.

Mr. Trump hasn’t revealed himself to be any different than the person he was when he first campaigned for president four years ago: impulsive, go-it-alone and lacking any capacity for self-doubt and self-reflection. Mr. de Blasio, however, has revealed himself to be something quite different from the transformational progressive who campaigned promising to address income inequality and racial disparities in policing.

His leadership has been criticized as passive, reactive and inconsistent. He resisted pressure to shut down public gathering places as the number of infections in the city rose in March. Then, one day after encouraging New Yorkers to grab a bite and a drink at the establishments they loved, he ordered them all closed. He wrongly claimed in April that scientists had just learned that asymptomatic carriers could spread the virus, when in fact it had been known for weeks. Despite feeling sick this week and participating in demonstrations over the weekend that exposed him to thousands of people, the mayor’s office said he would not be tested for the coronavirus, going against the city’s own guidelines.

When the city erupted after Mr. Floyd’s death, looters and vandals broke into stores, set fires and damaged property for two nights before the mayor declared a citywide curfew, prompting a dressing down from Mr. Cuomo, who said Mr. de Blasio and the New York Police Department “did not do their job.” But then Mr. de Blasio found himself undercut again. The police so aggressively enforced the curfew on peaceful protesters that the mayor was accused of enabling the very kind of police behavior he once promised to stop.

“It’s a very, very tough job,” Mr. Arzt said of being mayor. “But the guy who is out there fighting for leftist causes has disappeared.”"
"George Floyd, From ‘I Want to Touch the World’ to ‘I Can’t Breathe’","[Follow the live updates on Seattle, Bubba Wallace, statues and the confederate flag.]

HOUSTON — It was the last day of 11th grade at Jack Yates High School in Houston, nearly three decades ago. A group of close friends, on their way home, were contemplating what senior year and beyond would bring. They were black teenagers on the precipice of manhood. What, they asked one another, did they want to do with their lives?

“George turned to me and said, ‘I want to touch the world,’” said Jonathan Veal, 45, recalling the aspiration of one of the young men — a tall, gregarious star athlete named George Floyd whom he had met in the school cafeteria on the first day of sixth grade. To their 17-year-old minds, touching the world maybe meant the N.B.A. or the N.F.L.

“It was one of the first moments I remembered after learning what happened to him,” Mr. Veal said. “He could not have imagined that this is the tragic way people would know his name.”

The world now knows George Perry Floyd Jr. through his final harrowing moments, as he begged for air, his face wedged for nearly nine minutes between a city street and a police officer’s knee.

Mr. Floyd’s gasping death, immortalized on a bystander’s cellphone video during the twilight hours of Memorial Day, has powered two weeks of sprawling protests across America against police brutality. He has been memorialized in Minneapolis, where he died; in North Carolina, where he was born; and in Houston, where thousands stood in the unrelenting heat on Monday afternoon to file past his gold coffin and bid him farewell in the city where he spent most of his life.

Many of those who attended the public viewing said they saw Mr. Floyd as one of them — a fellow Houstonian who could have been their father, their brother or their son.

“This is something that touched really close,” said Kina Ardoin, 43, a nurse who stood in a line that stretched far from the church entrance. “This could have been anybody in my family.”

transcript

My name is Jonathan Veal. I have known George Floyd since the sixth grade at James D. Ryan Middle School in the community of Third Ward, which is located in Houston, Texas. The first day I saw him, I was in the cafeteria, and he came in. And I was just blown away by his height. He was 6’2“, and I was just in awe, just like wow, that’s a tall guy. And he was just tall and skinny. This guy is in the sixth grade? And that was the beginning of our relationship. I remember it was the last day of school in our junior year, and there was this place just north of our school, maybe three blocks, that we called The Hill. And we would just kind of go there just to hang out. And for some reason, the conversation shifted to OK, we’re about to graduate. It was like we’re no longer going to be teenagers anymore. So I know I talked about just wanting to get married, and George talked about college. And all of a sudden he made this statement. He says, man, I want to be big. I want to touch the world.



Most of us had not seen the world outside of, you know, Third Ward or the Houston community so it was just like, oh. Wow. OK.

He was just a fun person to be around. There was never a dull moment. Never a dull moment.

Me and Big George used to go to school all the time. And he’d get out and listen to music and talk about, you know, about the music world, and how he want to do this and do that, and just be successful.

We were young, just kids. We trying to figure this thing out, you know? It’s when you’re in your 20s, your early 20s and you’re trying to figure out — you’re trying to see what direction you’re going to go in, just waking up and just trying to figure it out.

I met Floyd seven to 10 years ago while I was trying to plant a church, Resurrection Houston’s Ministry, in the middle of Third Ward Houston, Texas, in the Cuney Homes Housing Project. And say I go to a neighborhood, I can knock on 50 doors. 50 people may come out. Floyd comes out the door, 100 people come out. Everybody knows him. He’s connected. Man, just to see his impact was amazing, his road to redemption. And then how God used him in this season and in this moment.



Soon as he come in the door, he asks you, are you good? You all right? Always. And he would say — he always said things twice sometimes. He always called me Al-Al, and he called Teresa T-T. He just — that’s just him. Every time we cooked him a meal, gave him a plate, he’d come down rubbing his tummy and just go, “thank you, thank you, thank you.” You know what I mean? And he always said this for the whole time that Teresa and me and him lived here together. He always would tell us, “I want y’all to know I appreciate you.” He always would tell us that.

After I learned that this was my friend, just a flood of emotions came about. I didn’t sleep the next couple of nights just thinking about what happened. And then that’s when it became global. And then I was like, wow, it’s literally happening. He’s touching the world. He’s touching the world. I was just like, wow.

From The New York Times, I’m Caitlin Dickerson. This is “The Daily.” Today: George Floyd’s funeral. My colleague Manny Fernandez was in Houston. It’s Wednesday, June 10.



Hi, guys.

Hey, Manny. It’s Caitlin.

How you doing?

I’m OK. How are you and where are you?

I am in the parking lot of the Fountain of Praise Church in Southwest Houston, where George Floyd’s funeral was just held.

And what was today about?

So today was about two different things — and you saw this during the service itself, and then I got this sense from talking to people outside. On the one hand, there was a lot of people who wanted to talk about George Floyd as a symbol of a movement, and George Floyd’s death not being in vain. And yet on the other hand, a lot of people were trying to say, hold on, wait, let’s talk about him as a man. And let’s kind of talk about the jokes he used to crack, and the pranks he used to pull, and what he was like in the projects of Houston where he’s from. And so I think that there was that two-sided story that you kind of heard today. Let’s remember the man who’s become this symbol, and let’s also just remember the man himself.

And this is a familiar dynamic for you, right? I mean, you’ve covered funerals for other people who’ve died at the hands of police, and you’ve seen this dynamic before.

Yeah, absolutely. It reminded me of 2014 with Michael Brown’s funeral, when people gather around, and they say, give us a little bit of space in this social justice movement that’s popping up around this person’s death. Give us a few hours in a day to talk about them and their flaws, right? And to sort of talk about them as a full human before their life becomes more myth than reality. And I think that the people here at the funeral tried to sort of hold onto that space as long as they can before the train has left the station.

And you heard some of that today, but you’ve also been reporting for the last few weeks on George Floyd, who he was. So what have you learned about his life?

I spent a lot of time at the place where he’s from. And he’s from a place called the Bricks. And the Bricks are a nickname for the Cuney Homes Public Housing Project in Houston. And he grew up in the Cuney Homes in the ‘80s, in the ‘90s and the early 2000s. And it’s a hard world. But by all accounts, he’s a pretty happy kid. George’s mother was sort of a matron of the Cuney Homes. She was raising her kids. She was raising George. And at the same time, she started raising her own grandchildren for a time, and she started raising some of the neighbor’s children. And she fed them, they spent the night at her apartment. And that’s who Miss Cissy was. That’s who George Floyd’s mother was, a mother to a lot of Cuney Homes.

So what happens once George moves into high school and then adulthood?

So George Floyd goes to high school just down the street from Cuney Homes. He goes to Jack Yates High School. He’s a big kid. Eventually he grows to 6’6“, and he kind of immediately becomes a star basketball player and a star football player. He helps take the football team to state shampionships in 1992, and he is so good that he gets a basketball scholarship to go to college in South Florida. And he goes there, and he plays a little bit of basketball. It doesn’t work out. He transfers back to Texas. He goes to the Kingsville campus of Texas A&M University, and he goes there for a couple years. Meanwhile, he’s going back and forth to Houston, back and forth to the Third Ward. And as he’s doing that, he meets this legendary producer named DJ Screw —

[MUSIC]:

— who eventually becomes sort of a legend in Houston rap circles.

(SINGING) Hey. Hey!

And there was a time in the early ‘90s when DJ Screw made a bunch of mix tapes.

(RAPPING) Welcome, y’all to the fabulous Carolina West. I own this [EXPLETIVE].

And DJ Screw is rapping on these tapes, but he also invites other rappers to come in. And a lot of these rappers are just kids from the neighborhood —

(RAPPING) Man, it’s going down. Know what I’m saying?

— while George Floyd is one of those guys rapping on DJ Screw’s mixtape.

(RAPPING) Know what I’m saying? Big Floyd representing [INAUDIBLE].

And he calls himself Big Floyd.

(RAPPING) — going down like a [EXPLETIVE], know what I’m saying? Watch me crawl low on my [EXPLETIVE] spiders. Welcome to the ghetto. It’s Third Ward, Texas. Boys shopping blades on they [EXPLETIVE] mixes. Boys in —

And then meanwhile, he’s still in college. He’s going to Texas A&M Kingsville. And it doesn’t work out. He pulls out of Texas A&M, he never gets his degree and he goes back to Cuney Homes. And that’s when his life sort of takes another turn. And it’s in 1997 that he gets his first run-in with law enforcement. And so for about a decade of his life, from the age of 23 in 1997, to when he was 34 in 2008, he had a string of arrests in Houston. Some of the arrests were felonies. Some of them were misdemeanors. He was arrested for drugs and for robbery, and a few other charges. His most serious case comes in 2008. He’s arrested for his role in a home invasion robbery, according to court documents. And so he pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. He’s sentenced to five years in state prison. He only serves four years, and he’s released in 2013. And after he’s released from prison, he really starts to turn his life around. He becomes more religious. George Floyd has a daughter who’s born around that time after he gets out of prison. And it turns out what we learned at the funeral is that he actually had five children and two grandchildren. And he starts reconnecting with his kids. He starts speaking out about and against gun violence. And he becomes almost this unofficial community leader back in the Cuney Homes, back in Third Ward, and he has a lot of respect out there. And then eventually, he gets plugged into this program that will eventually take him to Minneapolis.

We’ve been criticized for not writing about and publicizing more of the details of his criminal history. I think some people have this world view where if you’re an ex-con, then you’re an ex-con, and that’s all you’ll ever be in your life. And the people in the Cuney Homes, a lot of them have run-ins with law enforcement. But, you know, your life moves on after that, and people change. And so I think it’s sort of a balance to try to write about the totality of somebody’s life, the good and the bad, and try to do that in a way that honors the memory of a person whose reason for being in the news has to do with him being a victim of a crime and not the perpetrator of one.

So tell me about George Floyd’s final years and his final chapter.

He has a pretty quiet life in Minneapolis. He’s living with roommates. He’s working as a security guard at a nightclub. He has a girlfriend. He’s still very religious, reading the Bible. And he has this sort of quiet life. He called it his new chapter in Minneapolis. The people who knew him here in Houston say they thought he was pretty happy out there.



We’ll be right back.

So that’s George Floyd the person. And like you said, there’s also George Floyd the symbol and the beginning of a movement. So how did those two ideas of him play out during his funeral today?

Yeah.

Amen. Amen.

So the funeral is at a church in Houston called the Fountain of Praise. And the media wasn’t allowed inside. And so I spent most of the day outside talking to people.

Pastor Wright, we want to bring greetings to everyone who is within the sanctuary walls as well as those who are watching via stream or some platform today.

But it was live streamed.

[ORGAN PLAYING] In the tradition of the African-American church, this will be a home-going celebration. Come on. I want to say it again. This will be a home-going celebration of brother George Floyd tonight.

And here you had a number of elected officials, including many of the African-American political leaders in Houston and in Texas.

Let me just speak, briefly say — let me — on behalf of the city of Houston —

Mayor Turner of Houston spoke.

But as I speak right now, the city attorney is drafting an executive order.

And said that —

We will ban chokeholds and strangleholds.

— he wants to ban chokeholds in the Houston Police Department.

And I have a resolution that will be presented to the family.

You had Congressman Al Green come up.

This resolution is going to say to those who look through the vista of time that at this time, there lived one among us who was a child of God who was taken untimely. But we’re going to make sure that those who have look through time, that they will know that he made a difference within his time, because he changed not only this country, not only the United States, he changed the world. George Floyd changed the world.

And also —

Hello, everyone. On this day of prayer where we try to understand God’s plan and our pain —

— Joe Biden made a video message.

Now is the time for racial justice. That’s the answer we must give to our children when they ask, why? Because when there is justice for George Floyd, we will truly be on our way to racial justice in America.

And they all sort of talked about and told the family that his death would not be in vain.

God bless you all. God bless you all. [APPLAUSE]

I want to ask the members of the family who are going to come up and speak at this time, if you would please make your way to the stage.

And then after the first half of the funeral is sort of taken up by politicians —

Welcome, everyone. I am George Floyd’s aunt. And I just want to thank everybody, and I would like to thank the whole world, what it has done for my family today.

— the family sort of takes over.

But I just want to make this statement. The world knows George Floyd. I know Perry Jr. He was a pesky little rascal. [LAUGHS]

But we all loved him.

And they sort of physically take over, and they’re up there as a group.

(CRYING) I just want to say that I’m going to miss my brother a whole lot. And — [APPLAUSE]

I love him. I just want to say to him, I love you. And I thank God for giving me my own personal Superman. God bless you all.

And they start talking about their brother and their uncle.

Hello. My name is Brooke Williams, George Floyd’s niece. And I can breathe. As long as I’m breathing, justice will be served for Perry. First off, I want to thank all of you for coming out to support George Perry Floyd. My uncle was a father, brother, uncle and a cousin to many. Spiritually grounded, an activist, he always moved people with his words.

And it becomes very powerful to hear them talk in a very intimate way about their relatives.

My most favorite memory when my uncle was when he paid me to scratch his head. After long days of work, we arrived at home. We even created a song about it called “Scratch my head, scratch my head, yeah!” [LAUGHS]

But after that, I knew he was a comedian. He always told me, baby girl, you’re going to go so far with that beautiful smile and brains of yours.”=

Well then fast forward to 1998, I started a college exhibition tour team touring around the country going to play different colleges and exhibition games. And Big Floyd, that was my first power forward. I would be calling around, trying to get contracts with the different schools, and the coaches would ask me, who’s your big man? And I would say, George Floyd. They’d say, oh, you got Big Floyd. OK, well your team must be pretty good. And so then we would go off and play.

And it was those little moments and those little anecdotes that really, I think, helped people get a sense of who George was.

Everybody know who Big Floyd is now. Third Ward, Cuney Homes —

As the family spoke —

From the Cuney Home to Jack Yates High —

— you really heard —

— from Third Ward and the Cuney Homes to come and join me.

— this sort of Third Ward pride come up.

— in Third Ward Cuney Home, Texas.

Very historic, black-elected officials live there. It’s home to the only black-owned banking institution in Texas. Beyonce is from the Third Ward. It’s just a place of a lot of black pride and a lot of black history. At the same time, it’s also a place of a lot of struggle and a lot of poverty. And there’s a real strong sense that George Floyd is from this place that is a hard-fought and very proud place.

[ORGAN PLAYING]

At the direction of Senior Pastor, Pastor Remus Wright —

And then —

— my privilege and my honor today —

— you have the final eulogy —

— a man who needs no introduction but deserves one.

— delivered by the Reverend Al Sharpton.

Al Sharpton. [APPLAUSE]

And he appears. He’s standing there in a black and white preacher’s robe.

I hear people talk about what happened to George Floyd like there was something less than a crime. This was not just a tragedy, it was a crime.

And to me, there was this one moment early on. He’s standing up there and then he puts his glasses on, and he starts reading from this list.

— I give him recognition. I must also recognize several families are here.

As if he’s going to thank some of the different people. And he starts talking about some of the people who are there, and he says —

The mother of Trayvon Martin, will you stand?

— “The mother of Trayvon Martin, will you stand?”

The mother —

“The mother of Eric Garner, will you stand?”

The mother of Eric Garner, will you stand?

And he runs through this long list. It’s like a roll call.

The sister of Botham Jean, will you stand?

And people are cheering.

The family of Pamela Turner right here in Houston, will you stand?

They are standing, the crowd is standing.

The father of Michael Brown from Ferguson, Missouri, will you stand?

Wow. They’re all there.

Yeah.

The father of Ahmaud Arbery, will you stand?

And to have all of them there at this funeral, they know the pain of this more than anyone. And they have the right to be angrier than everyone else. And yet, here they are grieving with George Floyd’s family. And you realize that George Floyd is part of this family of victims that should not be a family.

All of these families came to stand with this family, because they know better than anyone else the pain they will suffer from the loss that they have gone through.

So there was one moment when I think Sharpton pulled together these two strands of the man and the symbol of George Floyd.

God always uses unlikely people to do his will.

And that was a moment when Sharpton was alluding to George Floyd’s arrest history.

If George Floyd had been an Ivy League school graduate and one of these ones with a long title, we would have been accused of reacting to his prominence. If he’d been a multimillionaire, they would have said that we were reacting to his wealth. If he had been a famous athlete, as he was on the trajectory to be, we would have said we were reacting to his fame. But God took an ordinary brother —

And he was sort of talking about him as an ordinary —

— from the Third Ward —

— imperfect person —

— from the housing projects —

— from the Third Ward projects.

— that nobody thought much about but those that knew him and loved him. He took the rejected stone.

And it was a very powerful moment where he called George Floyd a rejected stone, making a reference to scripture.

God took the rejected stone and made him the cornerstone of a movement that’s going to change the whole wide world. [APPLAUSE]

And how those officers may have thought that nobody cared about a guy like that.

Oh, if you would have had any idea that all of us would react, you’d have took your knee off his neck.

And obviously the world knows now that the world did care about somebody like that, and how he died and how he was treated.

If you had any idea that preachers white and black was going to line up in a pandemic when we were told to stay inside, and we’d come out and march in the streets at the risk of our health, you’d have took your knee off his neck. Because you thought his neck didn’t mean nothing. But God made his neck to connect his head to his body, and you had no right to put your knee on that neck.

I think in the past, I think there has been this desire to only pay attention to sort of perfect victims, only to give attention to cases in which the person had this sort of holy life. And any brush with the law, no matter how many years ago, somehow was thought to taint how people viewed whatever police killing was in the news. And I think that shifted a little bit. And I see the difference in George Floyd.

Your family’s going to miss you, George. But your nation is going to remember your name.

And Sharpton ended his remarks by touching on this idea that George Floyd was imperfect, and he still deserves the movement that was happening.

So we’re going to lay you to your mama now. You called for mama. We’re going to lay your body next to hers. But I know mama’s already embraced you, George. You fought a good fight. You kept the faith. You finished your course. Go on and get your rest now. Go on and see mama now. We’re going to fight on. We’re going to fight on. We’re going to fight on. We’re going to fight on. [ORGAN MUSIC]

I’m going to speak to y’all real quick. I just want to say, man, that I got my shortcomings and my flaws, and I ain’t better than nobody else. But man, the shootings that’s going on man, I don’t care what hood you’re from man, where you’re at, man, I love you and God loves you, man. Put them guns down, man. That ain’t what it is. You know, we grow up this, man. And y’all hold y’all head up, man. You got parents out here selling plates, man, trying to bury their kids, man. Think about it, man. Love y’all.



We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today. On Tuesday morning, President Trump endorsed a conspiracy theory that a 75-year-old man — who police were filmed pushing to the ground during a protest in Buffalo last week — had been using his cell phone to knock out law enforcement radios on behalf of the Antifa movement. In a tweet, the president offered no evidence of the theory but named a right wing news organization, One America News Network, in his tweet.

Did you have a reaction to the president’s tweet early —

I learned a long time ago not to comment on tweets, and I’m not going to break that —

But they are official statements.

Later in the day, Republican lawmakers and administration officials, including the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, dodged questions from reporters. The man who was injured in the incident, Martin Gugino, is still recovering in the hospital from a serious head injury. Meanwhile, a police officer in New York City was arrested and charged with assault on Tuesday after shoving a young woman to the ground, giving her a concussion, another scene that was filmed on a cell phone. And —

This is wrong! This is America! Please, God, help us! I mean it! This is a crisis in our world to make us not exercise our right to vote!

Five states held their primary elections on Tuesday, including Georgia, where a new voting system put into place in 2018 after claims of voter suppression experienced catastrophic meltdowns. State-ordered voting machines were said to be missing or malfunctioning, causing voters to wait in line for hours at polling places across the state. Some gave up and left before casting a vote. The problems were made worse by the coronavirus pandemic, which left fewer poll workers available than usual and added to wait times, because machines had to be disinfected. Predominantly black areas of Georgia experienced some of the worst obstacles to voting, raising concerns that the problems would further disenfranchise black voters.



That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Caitlin Dickerson. See you tomorrow.

Now a time stamp in the prolonged history of violence against black people, Mr. Floyd’s killing has inspired people of every race to march in the streets and kneel, chanting “black lives matter” in hundreds of cities and small towns.

But Mr. Floyd, 46, was more than the nearly nine-minute graphic video of his death. He was more than the 16 utterances, captured in the recording, of some version of “I can’t breathe.”

He was an outsize man who dreamed equally big, unswayed by the setbacks of his life.

Growing up in one of Houston’s poorest neighborhoods, he enjoyed a star turn as a basketball and football player, with three catches for 18 yards in a state championship game his junior year.

He was the first of his siblings to go to college, and he did so on an athletic scholarship. But he returned to Texas after a couple of years, and lost nearly a decade to arrests and incarcerations on mostly drug-related offenses. By the time he left his hometown for good a few years ago, moving 1,200 miles to Minneapolis for work, he was ready for a fresh start.

When he traveled to Houston in 2018 for his mother’s funeral — they died two years, one week apart — he told his family that Minneapolis had begun to feel like home. He had his mother’s name tattooed on his belly, a fact that was noted in his autopsy.

Mr. Floyd was born in Fayetteville, N.C., to George Perry and Larcenia Floyd. But he was really from a Houston neighborhood called the Bricks.

After his parents split up, his mother moved him and his siblings to Texas, where he grew up in the red brick world of Cuney Homes, a low-slung 564-unit public housing complex in Houston’s Third Ward that was named for Norris Wright Cuney, one of the most politically powerful black men in the state in the late 1800s.

Mr. Floyd’s mother — who was known as Cissy — was among the leaders of Cuney Homes and an active member of the resident council. She raised her own children and, at times, some of her grandchildren and some of her neighbors’ children, too.

As a child, Mr. Floyd was known in the Bricks as Perry, his middle name. As he grew, so, too, did his nicknames. He was Big Floyd, known as much for his big personality as his sense of humor.

Mr. Floyd’s height — he was more than six feet tall in middle school — created a kind of mystique.

“You can just imagine this tall kid as a freshman in high school walking the hallways. We were like, ‘Man, who is that guy?’ He was a jokester, always laughing and cracking jokes,” said Herbert Mouton, 45, who played on the Yates high school football team with Mr. Floyd. “We were talking the other day with classmates trying to think, ‘Had Floyd even ever had a fight before?’ And we couldn’t recall it.”

Mr. Mouton said that after the loss of a big game, Mr. Floyd would let the team sulk for a few minutes before telling a joke to lighten the mood. “He never wanted us to feel bad for too long,” he said.

Mr. Floyd saw sports as the path out of the Bricks. And so he leaned into his size and athletic prowess in a sports-obsessed state. As a tight end, Mr. Floyd helped power his football team to the state championship game in 1992.

In one exhilarating moment that was captured on video — and circulated after his death — Mr. Floyd soars above an opponent in the end zone to catch a touchdown pass.

After graduating from high school, Mr. Floyd left Texas on a basketball scholarship to South Florida Community College (now South Florida State College).

“I was looking for a power forward and he fit the bill. He was athletic and I liked the way he handled the ball,” said George Walker, who recruited Mr. Floyd. “He was a starter and scored 12 to 14 points and seven to eight rebounds.”

Mr. Floyd transferred two years later, in 1995, to Texas A&M University’s Kingsville campus, but he did not stay long. He returned home to Houston — and to the Third Ward — without a degree.

Known locally as the Tré, the Third Ward, south of downtown, is among the city’s historic black neighborhoods, and it has been featured in the music of one of the most famous people to grow up there, Beyoncé.

At times, life in the Bricks was unforgiving. Poverty, drugs, gangs and violence scarred many Third Ward families. Several of Mr. Floyd’s classmates did not live past their 20s.

Soon after returning, Mr. Floyd started rapping. He appeared as Big Floyd on mixtapes created by DJ Screw, a fixture in Houston’s hip-hop scene in the 1990s. His voice deep, his rhymes purposefully delivered at a slow-motion clip, Mr. Floyd rapped about “choppin’ blades” — driving cars with oversize rims — and his Third Ward pride.

For about a decade starting in his early 20s, Mr. Floyd had a string of arrests in Houston, according to court and police records. One of those arrests, for a $10 drug deal in 2004, cost him 10 months in a state jail.

Four years later, Mr. Floyd pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon and spent four years in prison. He was released in 2013 and returned home again — this time to begin the long, hard work of trying to turn his life around, using his missteps as a lesson for others.

Stephen Jackson, a retired professional basketball player from Port Arthur, Texas, met Mr. Floyd a year or two before Mr. Jackson joined the N.B.A. They had sports in common, Mr. Jackson said, but they also looked alike — enough to call each other “twin” as a term of endearment.

“I tell people all the time, the only difference between me and George Floyd, the only difference between me and my twin, the only difference between me and Georgie, is the fact that I had more opportunities,” he said, later adding, “If George would have had more opportunities, he might have been a pro athlete in two sports.”

After prison, Mr. Floyd became even more committed to his church. Inspired by a daughter, Gianna Floyd, born after he was released, Mr. Floyd spent a lot of time at Resurrection Houston, a church that holds many of its services on the basketball court in the middle of Cuney Homes. He would set up chairs and drag out to the center of the court the service’s main attraction — the baptism tub.

“We’d baptize people on the court and we’ve got this big old horse trough. And he’d drag that thing by himself onto that court,” said Patrick Ngwolo, a lawyer and pastor of Resurrection Houston, who described Mr. Floyd as a father figure for younger community residents.

Eventually, Mr. Floyd became involved in a Christian program with a history of taking men to Minnesota from the Third Ward and providing them with drug rehabilitation and job placement services.

“When you say, ‘I’m going to Minnesota,’ everybody knows you’re going to this church-work program out of Minnesota,” Mr. Ngwolo said, “and you’re getting out of this environment.”

His move would be a fresh start, Mr. Ngwolo said, his story one of redemption.

In Minnesota, Mr. Floyd lived in a red clapboard duplex with two roommates on the eastern edge of St. Louis Park, a leafy, gentrifying Minneapolis suburb.

Beginning sometime in 2017, he worked as a security guard at the Salvation Army’s Harbor Light Center, a downtown homeless shelter and transitional housing facility. The staff members got to know Mr. Floyd as someone with a steady temperament, whose instinct to protect employees included walking them to their cars.

“It takes a special person to work in the shelter environment,” said Brian Molohon, executive director of development at the Salvation Army Northern Division. “Every day you are bombarded with heartache and brokenness.”

Even as Mr. Floyd settled into his position, he looked for other jobs. While working at the Salvation Army, he answered a job ad for a bouncer at Conga Latin Bistro, a restaurant and dance club.

Jovanni Thunstrom, the owner, said Mr. Floyd quickly became part of the work family. He came in early and left late. And though he tried, he never quite mastered salsa dancing.

“Right away I liked his attitude,” said Mr. Thunstrom, who was also Mr. Floyd’s landlord. “He would shake your hand with both hands. He would bend down to greet you.”

Mr. Floyd kept a Bible by his bed. Often, he read it aloud. And despite his height, Mr. Floyd would fold himself in the hallway to frequently pray with Theresa Scott, one of his roommates.

“He had this real cool way of talking. His voice reminded me of Ray Charles. He’d talk fast and he was so soft-spoken,” said Alvin Manago, 55, who met Mr. Floyd at a 2016 softball game. They bonded instantly and became roommates. “He had this low-pitched bass. You had to get used to his accent to understand him. He’d say, ‘Right-on, right-on, right-on.’”

Mr. Floyd spent the final weeks of his life recovering from the coronavirus, which he learned he had in early April. After he was better, he started spending more time with his girlfriend, and he had not seen his roommates in a few weeks, Mr. Manago said.

Like millions of people, his roommates in the city that was to be his fresh start watched the video that captured Mr. Floyd taking his last breaths. They heard him call out for his late mother — “Mama! Mama!”

On Tuesday morning, 15 days after that anguished cry, Mr. Floyd will be laid to rest beside her.

"As Virus Surges, Younger People Account for ‘Disturbing’ Number of Cases","CHICAGO — Younger people are making up a growing percentage of new coronavirus cases in cities and states where the virus is now surging, a trend that has alarmed public health officials and prompted renewed pleas for masks and social distancing.

In Arizona, where drive-up sites are overwhelmed by people seeking coronavirus tests, people ages 20 to 44 account for nearly half of all cases. In Florida, which breaks records for new cases nearly every day, the median age of residents testing positive for the virus has dropped to 35, down from 65 in March.

And in Texas, where the governor paused the reopening process on Thursday as hospitals grow increasingly crowded, young people now account for the majority of new cases in several urban centers. In Cameron County, which includes Brownsville and the tourist town of South Padre Island, people under 40 make up more than half of newly reported cases.

“What is clear is that the proportion of people who are younger appears to have dramatically changed,” said Joseph McCormick, a professor of epidemiology at UTHealth School of Public Health in Brownsville. “It’s really quite disturbing.”

The pattern is drawing notice from mayors, governors and public health officials, and comes as a worrisome sign for cities and institutions as they look to the fall. The rise in cases among younger people could complicate the plans of leaders who are eager to open schools and universities, resume athletic events and return to normal life and a fully functioning economy.

The increases could reflect a simple reality: Since many states have reopened bars, restaurants and offices, the coronavirus has been allowed to spread more widely across communities, including to more young people. But people in their 20s and 30s are also more likely to go out socializing, experts say, raising concerns that asymptomatic young people are helping to spread the virus to more vulnerable Americans at a time when cases are surging dangerously in the South and the West.

Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Thursday that younger people have helped fuel the increase in known coronavirus infections — and that in the past, many of those infections went undiagnosed.

“Our best estimate right now is that for every case that was reported, there actually were 10 other infections,” he said.

No single answer fully accounts for the surge of cases among young people, who are less likely to be hospitalized or die from the coronavirus than older people.

“Is it the governor’s reopening? Is it Memorial Day? Is it the George Floyd demonstrations? Is it going to the beach?” said Eric Boerwinkle, dean of the UTHealth School of Public Health in Houston. “We don’t really know, but it is probably all of those things that are contributing.”

The United States recorded 36,975 new cases on Wednesday, a new high point in daily cases as the country confronted a new stage of the crisis two months after the previous high in late April. The resurgence is most immediately threatening states that reopened relatively early in the South and the West. Alabama, Florida, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas all reported their highest single-day totals this week, as did Montana and Utah, and cases were rising in 29 states on Thursday.

Adriana Carter, 21, is among the newly infected.

For many weeks this spring, she said, she took steps to limit her exposure, eating many of her meals at her apartment in San Marcos, Texas, and wearing a mask when going in and out of stores. At the one Black Lives Matter protest she attended, most people were in masks.

But after a particularly long week of juggling online summer classes and her job at an eye clinic, Ms. Carter took a risk one Saturday night in early June and met a friend at the Square, a popular bar district downtown. Though they were careful to avoid the most crowded spots, they chose not to wear masks as they sipped drinks inside and endured the hot Texas weather.

Days later, her friend woke up feeling ill. Both tested positive for the virus.

“We were told we could go out to bars,” she said, adding that she had been careful to quarantine since she learned that she had been exposed. “It’s very unusual for anyone in their 20s to stay at home all the time — not giving any excuses or anything, but I just think we are all just trying to do the best we can.”

The new cases among young people may appear to be a departure from the early days of the pandemic when infections in nursing homes were spiraling out of control, and the virus appeared at higher rates among older people in New York City.

Experts cautioned that the seemingly new prevalence among young people may be, in part, a reflection of more widely available testing. But the growing numbers of people hospitalized in states like North Carolina and Texas also suggest increased transmission of the virus.

Even now, people younger than 50 are being hospitalized at a far lower rate than people older than that, according to C.D.C. data.

While the effect of the coronavirus on younger people “may not be highly associated with hospitalization and death,” Dr. Redfield said, “they do act as a transmission connector for individuals that could in fact be at a higher risk.”

In Florida, which has emerged as a particularly concerning hot spot, reopened bars have been a source of contagion among young people. The state shut down the Knight’s Pub, a popular bar near the University of Central Florida in Orlando, after 28 patrons and 13 employees were infected.

In Miami-Dade County, the number of known coronavirus cases among 18- to 34-year-olds increased fivefold in a month, to more than 1,000, Mayor Carlos Gimenez said this week.

“They’re thinking they’re invincible,” he said, adding that many of the infected have no symptoms.

They are at higher risk, though, if they are overweight or have diabetes or other medical conditions, he said. About a third of the coronavirus patients at the public Jackson Health System were from that age group, and about half had a high body mass index, Mr. Gimenez said.

Gov. Ron DeSantis described “a real explosion in new cases” among younger people. “Part of that is just natural,” he said. “You kind of go and you want to be doing things. You want to be out and about. The folks who are older and would be more vulnerable are being a bit more careful.”

In fact, some experts believe that a decision by older people to stay home and exercise caution to avoid the virus may, in part, help explain why young people appear to be an increasing portion of new cases.

In Dallas County, people between the ages of 18 and 40 have made up 52 percent of newly reported cases since the beginning of June, a jump from the 38 percent that young people represented in March, according to county data.

At the same time, older people have begun to represent a smaller portion of the total number of people who test positive for the virus. In June, people over 65 have made up 8 percent of new confirmed cases in Dallas County, down from 16 percent in March.

The situation is particularly unsettling in Hays County, home to Texas State University in San Marcos. Coronavirus cases have surged since the beginning of June, to 2,100 this week, from 371 at the start of the month. People in their 20s now make up more than half of all known cases, officials said.

In Arizona, rising infections have set many people on edge, including some residents in their 20s and 30s.

In the Arcadia neighborhood of Phoenix, Ian Bartczak, who is 31, said he did not feel comfortable dining out at restaurants and was dismayed to see crowds of young people squeezing onto patios and bars on a commercial strip near his home.

“It goes back to, what is a want and what is a need?” said Mr. Bartczak, who works for an education technology company. “Did you have to go to a big swimming party or El Hefe nightclub with your friends?”

His point of view has created awkwardness with some friends, he said. He has turned down invitations to go out for sushi, and been puzzled by friends who chose to visit casinos.

“It’s affected some of my relationships because I won’t see them or get kind of angry,” he said. “How are you not willing to help the old lady behind you who could have a poor immune system? Or help lower our cases so we can increase our economy?”

In Phoenix, Michael Donoghue, an investment analyst who is 33, said he felt comfortable going out — carefully — since he is single and healthy, lives alone and takes care to avoid close contact with people who might be at risk, like his 91-year-old grandmother.

Only once since restrictions were lifted in that state has he felt uncomfortable while out, he said. A bar he visited with friends in Scottsdale was crowded.

“It just felt like, should we be doing this right now?” he said.

The resurgence of the virus has echoes of its earliest days in the United States, as places like California and Washington State, which saw some of the country’s first outbreaks, were seeing new upticks.

In King County, Wash., which includes Seattle, people in their 20s and 30s make up about 45 percent of new coronavirus cases — a number that was 25 percent in March, according to Dr. Judith A. Malmgren, an epidemiologist in Seattle.

She believes the real percentage is even larger than what is being measured because younger people are less likely to be symptomatic. That said, she warned that the risk of infecting other people was serious.

“Just because you’re in an age group that is less likely to die from coronavirus,” she said, “does not mean that you live alone.”

"Vast Federal Aid Has Capped Rise in Poverty, Studies Find","WASHINGTON — An unprecedented expansion of federal aid has prevented the rise in poverty that experts predicted this year when the coronavirus sent unemployment to the highest level since the Great Depression, two new studies suggest. The assistance could even cause official measures of poverty to fall.

The studies carry important caveats. Many Americans have suffered hunger or other hardships amid long delays in receiving the assistance, and much of the aid is scheduled to expire next month. Millions of people have been excluded from receiving any help, especially undocumented migrants, who often have American children.

Still, the evidence suggests that the programs Congress hastily authorized in March have done much to protect the needy, a finding likely to shape the debate over next steps at a time when 13.3 percent of Americans remain unemployed.

Democrats, who want to continue the expiring aid, can cite the effect of the programs on poverty as a reason to continue them, while Republicans may use it to bolster their doubts about whether more spending is needed or affordable.

“Right now, the safety net is doing what it’s supposed to do for most families — helping them secure a minimally decent life,” said Zachary Parolin, a member of the Columbia University team forecasting this year’s poverty rate. “Given the magnitude of the employment loss, this is really remarkable.’’

The Columbia group’s midrange forecast has poverty rising only slightly this year to 12.7 percent, from 12.5 percent before the coronavirus. Without the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act — the March law that provided one-time checks to most Americans and weekly bonuses to the unemployed — it would have reached 16.3 percent, the researchers found. That would have pushed nearly 12 million more people into poverty.

Under the government’s fullest measure, a typical family of four is considered poor with an income below about $28,000.

The researchers estimate the CARES Act will increase safety net spending this year by $460 billion, more than what the government spent all last year to support the incomes of families that are not elderly.

In a separate study, Bruce D. Meyer and Jeehoon Han of the University of Chicago and James X. Sullivan of Notre Dame, analyzing Census Bureau survey data, found that incomes rose among needy Americans in April, despite cresting unemployment, as government payments began.

They estimate that poverty in April and May fell to 8.6 percent for the previous 12 months, from 10.9 percent in January and February. (They use a different census definition of poverty than the Columbia group.)

“When we initially saw our results, we thought, ‘How could this be true?’” Mr. Sullivan said, given the economic crisis. “But when you look at the size of the government response, it makes sense.”

After losing their jobs, millions of workers have experienced a bewildering mix of hardship, delay and relief. Consider the experience of Melody Bedico, a single mother in Seattle who works as a clerk at an airport hotel.

As travel plunged in March, so did her work hours, until the hotel closed and left her with no income.

Though she immediately applied for unemployment insurance, Ms. Bedico got no help for two months. Multiple calls a day to the Washington state unemployment office went unanswered. Someone once put her on hold for two hours, then cut her off. (She cried.) When food ran short, Ms. Bedico limited herself to two meals a day to feed her 12-year-old daughter. She fell three months behind on her mortgage.

“My whole body really ached with stress, from my head to my toes,” she said.

Then $7,600 suddenly arrived for eight weeks of back benefits, including a $600 weekly bonus. Counting a stimulus payment, Ms. Bedico’s income, $15,500 for three months, is nearly 60 percent more than she would have earned at the hotel.

“I was so happy — I really needed that money,” she said.

The peril has not passed. Though the aid will lift Ms. Bedico’s annual income above the poverty line, she does not know when she will return to work. After the bonus ends next month, her benefits will plummet, leaving her with an income 40 percent lower than normal but facing the same bills. “I’m worried I could lose my house,” she said.

The CARES Act contained three major provisions to bolster incomes. It offered most households one-time payments (up to $1,200 per adult and $500 per child). It broadened unemployment insurance to include millions of gig workers and other nontraditional employees. And it added $600 to weekly unemployment checks through July — a bonus of nearly $11,000 on top of regular payments, for those who qualify all four months.

The effect has been significant. The economist Peter Ganong and two colleagues at the University of Chicago found that among workers eligible for unemployment, two-thirds can collect sums that exceed their earnings. Until the $600 bonus expires, the poorest fifth can at least double their lost pay. While state benefits vary, the median worker is eligible to receive 134 percent of his or her pay.

While few who get the enhanced benefits will fall into poverty, Mr. Ganong warned that some jobless workers were ineligible and that bonuses would expire long before the economy recovered. “This is a strong start but only the first chapter of a long story,” he said.

Poverty rates are based on annual incomes, so families losing aid may suffer new hardship even though the earlier assistance leaves them above the formal poverty line.

Some analysts warn that hardship has grown, even if poverty rates have not. Diane Schanzenbach, an economist at Northwestern University, notes that food insecurity is twice its prepandemic rate and child hunger has risen even more. Part of the hardship may stem from the growth in income volatility — needy families generally lack credit or savings to sustain them through delays.

“A lot of people aren’t seeing the money yet,” Ms. Schanzenbach said. “I’m worried about Congress taking its foot off the gas.”

One person whose income has grown is Sunshine Lopez, 41, a medical assistant in Spokane who left work on a doctor’s advice because her daughter has a compromised immune system. Workers who quit jobs normally cannot collect jobless benefits, but the CARES Act contains a medical exception.

“I had to make a decision between my daughter and my job,” she said.

Fearing delays, she was surprised when help quickly arrived — $840 a week after taxes — more than 50 percent higher than her regular pay. Without the CARES Act, she said, “I probably would have been on the street.’’

Many unemployment offices remain plagued by long delays, with Florida’s system especially overwhelmed. A sophisticated online fraud scheme, which authorities say may be based in Nigeria, has slowed processing in many states. Washington, hit particularly hard, has asked the National Guard to help process claims.

For unemployed workers without jobless aid, times are harder than usual. Carlos Arciga, 53, got fired from an apple-packing warehouse in Yakima, Wash., after missing two days with a fever. He sought jobless benefits and waited for three months until the state said the firing disqualified him.

Normally, he said, he could have found a new job. “I’m a guy who works all the time,” Mr. Arciga said. Now he lives with his parents and survives on food stamps. “I’m in a bad spot — I don’t have a place, and I don’t have any money,” he said.

Undocumented migrants face special risks of falling into poverty, and many have American children. The CARES Act bars an entire household from stimulus payments even if a single member lacks legal status. The Migration Policy Institute estimates that prevents 15.4 million people from receiving aid — about 10 million undocumented migrants and more than five million children and spouses who are legal residents or citizens. Unauthorized migrants are also barred from jobless benefits.

An undocumented woman in Manhattan, who asked to be identified only by her first name, Mercedes, is part of a mixed-status family suffering new hardships. Her partner, who is also undocumented, lost his construction job at the start of the pandemic, and they have received no cash income since. They are raising her 16-year-old and their two children, ages 4 and 2 — all American citizens.

After exhausting $1,500 in savings, they have survived on the children’s food stamps and groceries distributed at school, with adults eating less to keep the children fed. With legal status, the family could have received more than $12,000 in aid. Mercedes called it “a terrible injustice” to treat her children different from other Americans.

“Let people’s hearts be touched — these kids have needs like any other legal person,” she said.

Elizabeth Ruiz, an undocumented restaurant cook in Dallas, does not resent the government excluding her from aid. “It’s their country, their rules,” she said. But her car has been repossessed, and she and her husband, another undocumented worker who lost his job, have relied on groceries and rental assistance from food banks.

“This is the most difficult economic time we’ve lived through, even in Mexico,” she said.

In forecasting poverty, the Columbia researchers — who include Megan Curran and Christopher Wimer — considered three scenarios, depending on what share of eligible workers succeed in getting aid amid the delays. Poverty would rise slightly to 12.7 percent if workers enjoy “medium access” to benefits and fall to 11.3 percent with “high access.” (Workers have already exceeded the “low access” scenario, making it obsolete.)

An earlier forecast they made, which did not account for the CARES Act, warned that poverty could reach the highest level in the half-century for which there is data.

With medium access to benefits, the black and white poverty rates will change little, but the Latino and Asian numbers will rise, partly because of the ban on aid to households with unauthorized immigrants. The projected poverty rates for blacks (20.2 percent) and Latinos (20.3 percent) are more than twice as high as those for whites (8.7 percent), but without the CARES Act, the disparities would have grown even larger. For Asians, the poverty rate is 14.5 percent.

While applauding the effect of federal aid to date, the Columbia researchers emphasize the importance of continuing it. “What we’re doing has been largely successful, but families could find themselves in big trouble in the fall after it expires,” Mr. Wimer said.

Mr. Meyer of the University of Chicago is less certain of future need. “The payments have worked so far, but I wouldn’t commit to spending more than a couple months out because we don’t know how quickly the economy will recover,” he said.

Mr. Ganong praised the CARES Act for restraining poverty among minorities at a time of elevated concern about racial injustice. “You can think about it as addressing many of the economic issues raised by Black Lives Matter,” he said.

While many people endured delays, Trina Harris experienced the opposite — unemployment checks came quickly, then stopped without explanation. A housekeeper in a Seattle hotel, Ms. Harris, 49, earns $18 an hour while raising a daughter and a grandson with special needs.

The jobless benefits she received, added to her stimulus check, more than doubled her normal income for six weeks. Then the check was replaced by a computer message that said “pending.”

Ms. Harris is so frugal she had taxes taken out of her jobless benefits and set aside money for the rent — a special focus of anxiety. (“I always — always — pay the rent.”) She is so worried about becoming homeless that when her grandson talks to a counselor online, “I slip my own issues in there, too.”

After 22 years at the same hotel, Ms. Harris said, “I’m not looking for no free ride,” but said of the CARES Act, “we needed that help.”"
Federal Arrests Show No Sign That Antifa Plotted Protests,"Inciting a riot. Hurling a Molotov cocktail. Plotting to sow destruction. Those are some of the most serious charges brought by federal prosecutors against demonstrators at protests across the country in recent weeks.

But despite cries from President Trump and others in his administration, none of those charged with serious federal crimes amid the unrest have been linked so far to the loose collective of anti-fascist activists known as antifa.

A review of the arrests of dozens of people on federal charges reveals no known effort by antifa to perpetrate a coordinated campaign of violence. Some criminal complaints described vague, anti-government political leanings among suspects, but a majority of the violent acts that have taken place at protests have been attributed by federal prosecutors to individuals with no affiliation to any particular group.

Even so, Attorney General William P. Barr has blamed antifa for orchestrating the mass protests, which broke out in cities and towns across the country after the death in police custody of George Floyd. “There is clearly some high degree of organization involved at some of these events and coordinated tactics that we are seeing,” Mr. Barr said. “Some of it relates to antifa, some of it relates to groups that act very much like antifa.”

Mr. Trump has sought to expand and exploit accusations against what he has called the involvement of “radical leftists” in the protests. At one point the president said that antifa would be declared a “terrorist organization,” although it is not a single organization nor does any American law allow using that designation against a domestic group. On Tuesday, the president suggested on Twitter, without providing any evidence, that a 75-year-old Buffalo protester hospitalized after being knocked down by the police could be “an ANTIFA provocateur.”

Mr. Trump and other Republicans have also sought to raise campaign funds off the unsubstantiated accusations. “Stand with President Trump against antifa!” read a banner advertisement on Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign website this week.

Marjorie Greene, a congressional candidate in Georgia, produced a campaign ad showing her armed with an AR-15-style rifle and threatening antifa activists. “You won’t burn our churches, loot our businesses or destroy our homes,” she said.

Asked why the myriad criminal complaints do not single out antifa, Mr. Barr said on Fox News this week that preliminary charges did not require linking suspects to a particular group, adding that there was “a witches’ brew of extremist groups that are trying to exploit this situation on all sides.”

F.B.I. agents and federal prosecutors have pursued charges aggressively against rioters, looters and others accused of wreaking havoc during the demonstrations. Law enforcement officials have relied on a variety of federal statutes to make arrests, including conspiracy to commit arson, starting a riot, civil disorder and possession of a Molotov cocktail.

The most serious case that has emerged in federal court involved three men in Nevada linked to a loose, national network of far-right extremists advocating the overthrow of the U.S. government. They were arrested on May 30 on charges of trying to foment violence during Black Lives Matter protests.

Given the sheer volume of thousands of arrests nationwide in recent weeks, officials cautioned that many investigations remain in the early stages with investigators still trying to determine affiliations. In addition, state and local court documents are far harder to search comprehensively.

However, interviews with several major police departments and a review of hundreds of newspaper articles about arrests around the country revealed no evidence of an organized political effort behind the looting and other violence.

“We saw no organized effort of antifa here in Los Angeles,” said Josh Rubenstein, the spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department.

Asked in an interview about the involvement of antifa or other extremist groups in Minneapolis, Medaria Arradondo, the chief of police, said, “As I sit here today, I have not received any sort of official information identifying any of the groups.”

In one example where antifa is mentioned, the police in Austin, Texas, said members of the Red Guards, a Maoist organization, were involved in organizing the looting of a Target store. The Red Guards have been associated with past antifa protests in Austin, but local activists said they were largely estranged from the group.

While anarchists and anti-fascists openly acknowledged being part of the immense crowds, they call the scale, intensity and durability of the protests far beyond anything they might dream of organizing. Some tactics used at the protests, like the wearing of all black and the shattering of store windows, are reminiscent of those used by anarchist groups, say those who study such movements.

In Portland, Ore., those affiliated with Rose City Antifa said they had supported the continuing protests. But the city’s antifa actions have long involved a wide range of people, some who dress in black apparel and face coverings and others who show up in everyday clothing to denounce far-right extremists and police militarization. There have also been various far-left activities in Seattle, including people who have spray-painted anarchist symbols on public property.

Antifa has roots in the Occupy Wall Street protests of a decade ago and the demonstrations against the World Trade Organization in the 1990s. During Mr. Trump’s inauguration, antifa activists marched in Washington vandalizing businesses and at one point setting fire to a limousine.

Over the next several months, its followers disrupted events hosted by right-wing speakers like Ann Coulter and Milo Yiannopoulos. When the far right fought back, organizing its own public protests, anti-fascist activists met them on the streets in what often turned into violent confrontations, culminating in the bloody rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017.

Anarchists and others accuse officials of trying to assign blame to extremists rather than accept the idea that millions of Americans from a variety of political backgrounds have been on the streets demanding change. Numerous experts also called the participation of extremist organizations overstated.

“A significant number of people in positions of authority are pushing a false narrative about antifa being behind a lot of this activity,” said J.M. Berger, the author of the book “Extremism” and an authority on militant movements. “These are just unbelievably large protests at a time of great turmoil in this country, and there is surprisingly little violence given the size of this movement.”

Christopher Wray, the F.B.I. director, told the Senate Judiciary Committee in July that the agency “considers antifa more of an ideology than an organization.”

In Las Vegas, the complaint filed in U.S. District Court said the three suspects called themselves members of the “boogaloo,” which is described as a far-right movement “to signify a coming civil war and/or fall of civilization.”

At a protest, the three strapped on bulletproof vests, grabbed their rifles and waded into the crowd, hoping to provoke clashes between protesters and the police, according to court papers. One taunted police officers, yelling in their faces, while a second chided protesters “that peaceful protests don’t accomplish anything and they needed to be violent,” the complaint said.

When that failed, they plotted to blow up an electric substation along the route of the demonstration in the hope that would prompt more violence between the police and protesters, according to the complaint. They were arrested after preparing Molotov cocktails from gasoline and lemonade bottles before a march.

Robert M. Draskovich Jr., a lawyer for one of the accused, Stephen T. Parshall, 35, said his client denied all the charges.

Individuals associated with the boogaloo movement have been out in force at numerous demonstrations in the past few years, clad in their distinctive combat dress and armed with rifles. They often claim that they appear armed in public to underscore their commitment to Second Amendment rights, or to protect local businesses.

But online, boogaloo discussion groups overflow with racist statements and threats to exploit any unrest to incite a race war that will bring about a new government system.

In Denver, the police seized a small arsenal including three assault rifles, numerous magazines, several bulletproof vests and other military paraphernalia from the car trunk of a self-professed “boogaloo” adherent headed toward a protest, a man who had previously livestreamed his own support for armed confrontations with the police.

After a demonstration in Athens, Ga., on May 31 ended with the National Guard being called in and tear gas being fired to clear protesters away from the gates of the University of Georgia, Chief Cleveland L. Spruill wrote a lengthy memo spelling out his concerns around extremist involvement in the protests.

Given the volatile mix of protesters, including armed men, he said, he feared a repeat of Charlottesville. Some participants called such fears overblown given the overall peaceful tenor of the protest.

In New York, the police briefed reporters on May 31, claiming that radical anarchists from outside the state had plotted ahead of protests by setting up encrypted communications systems, arranging for street medics and collecting bail funds.

Within five days, however, Dermot F. Shea, the city’s police commissioner, acknowledged that most of the hundreds of people arrested at the protests in New York were actually New Yorkers who took advantage of the chaos to commit crimes and were not motivated by political ideology. John Miller, the police official who had briefed reporters, told CNN that most looting in New York had been committed by “regular criminal groups.”

In Austin, court documents said several members of the Red Guards participated in burglarizing a Target store, including a woman who streamed the event on Facebook Live, encouraging people to come “even if you do not want to loot,” one affidavit said.

Although the court documents identified the Red Guards as part of the city’s anti-fascist umbrella organization, several Austin activists described the group as either defunct or estranged because of its penchant for troubling acts such as laying a dead cat on the doorstep of a business involved in a gentrification dispute.

Kit O’Connell, a longtime radical leftist activist and community organizer in Austin, said that shortly after Mr. Trump’s election, the group took part in anti-fascist protests in the city against a local white supremacist group and scuffled separately with Act for America, an anti-Muslim organization.

“They’ve been an influence at the protests but they’re not in charge — no one’s really in charge,” Mr. O’Connell said.

Carl Guthrie, a lawyer for Samuel Miller, one of those charged with burglary, denied that his client had any connection to the Red Guards. He called such accusations “a transparent, incendiary attempt to distract from the problems plaguing our society — systemic racism and state-sponsored murder.”

Experts on extremism said the few suspects arrested with overt political goals fall under the broad category of “accelerationists,” groups that hope to exploit any public unrest to further their own anti-government goals.

Florida’s Coronavirus Spike is Ravaging Migrant Farmworkers,"IMMOKALEE, Fla. — Inside her tidy house, a modest patio apartment wedged in a neighborhood of itinerant farmworkers, Angelina Velásquez packed. A half-filled travel bag lay on the couch, surrounded by clothes to be folded. The annual harvest was over in Immokalee, the country’s winter tomato capital, and it was time to head north.

Ms. Velásquez, a 52-year-old single mother of two, did not want to go. Not on the long ride in a loaded van up eight states to New Jersey. Not into the crammed living quarters she would be sharing with her daughters, 11 and 15, and other laborers like herself who would be spending the summer picking blueberries. Not on a journey whose every step put them at risk of contracting the coronavirus.

“We’re afraid,” said Ms. Velásquez, who so far is healthy. “But where am I supposed to go? There is no work here.”

Ms. Velásquez and thousands of other migrant workers make their way each year from southern Florida up the East Coast and into the Midwest, following the ripening of fruits and vegetables. Watermelons in Georgia. Sweet potatoes in North Carolina. Apples in Michigan.

This year, many will bring the coronavirus with them.

Florida’s agricultural communities have become cradles of infection, fueling a worrying new spike in the state’s daily toll in new infections, which has hit new records in recent days. The implications go far beyond Florida: Case numbers in places like Immokalee are swelling just as many farmworkers are migrating up the Eastern Seaboard for the summer harvest.

As is the case with agricultural communities around the country, Florida’s farming regions have a high degree of built-in risk. Fruit and vegetable pickers toil close to each other in fields, ride buses shoulder-to-shoulder and sleep in cramped apartments or trailers with other laborers or several generations of their families.

Immokalee has a small federally funded clinic, but does not have its own hospital.

Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has called the contagion in agricultural communities Florida’s “No. 1 outbreak.” He has also repeated the Trump administration’s misleading claim that the rising case numbers in the state should be mostly attributed to more widespread testing and not to the economic reopening. Some bars and restaurants that recently opened have had to close again as employees and patrons have gotten sick.

“We’re not rolling back,” Mr. DeSantis said on Tuesday.

That farmworkers essential to the economy were vulnerable to infection has been evident for months. In Washington State, labor unions tried to get bunk beds banned in farmworker housing. Regulators let the bunks stay but put other rules in place last month to try to ensure physical distancing.

Despite the known risks, it took many weeks for a coordinated public health response to take shape in Immokalee. Doctors Without Borders, the nonprofit organization that usually deploys to poor and conflict-ridden parts of the world, arrived in April to help at the request of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers. Its roving testing site has twice set up at the flea market off Main Street, with its outdoor clothes racks and taco stands.

“We’re also still a little shocked that we’re here,” said Jean Stowell, who oversees the organization’s domestic coronavirus response team, which has embedded in the Navajo Nation, New York and Puerto Rico. “We knew that migration was an issue in the U.S. that would expose people to vulnerability. We knew that they would struggle to get care.”

At first, tests were hard to come by outside of the clinic and few people wanted to get them, for fear of jeopardizing their livelihoods. Now testing sites draw short lines of people standing quietly a few feet apart, with umbrellas shielding them from the harsh sun. Big signs around town display proper hand-washing and mask-wearing techniques. Some posters debunk myths, including that eating garlic, consuming vitamin C or taking hot showers might prevent infection. Radio stations broadcast question-and-answer sessions in Spanish and Haitian Creole.

The Florida Department of Health did not do mass local testing until early May, and then found an alarming number of cases in Immokalee and other largely immigrant and impoverished farm towns. A watermelon farm in Alachua County that tested 100 workers after a sick laborer arrived from Miami-Dade County found 90 positive cases, Mr. DeSantis said, though only one had symptoms.

Lake Worth, a suburban Palm Beach County community of about 39,000 that has a large population of Guatemalan and Mexican immigrants, has 1,418 confirmed cases, almost as many as St. Petersburg, a city six times larger. Belle Glade, a sugar cane city of about 20,000, has 514 cases. Indiantown, population 7,000, has 534.

And Immokalee, a community of 25,000 on the western edge of the Everglades, has 1,207 — more than Miami Beach, a city three times larger. The positive test rate in Collier County, home to Immokalee, is 10 percent, about double the state rate.

The office of Nikki Fried, the state’s agriculture commissioner and a Democrat frequently at odds with the governor, disputed that farm towns were spreading the virus as much as Mr. DeSantis said, given that most harvests have concluded.

Yet the growing numbers and the potential for the virus to spread further outside of farming communities have remained a concern for state officials.

“You don’t want those folks mixing with the general public if you have an outbreak,” Mr. DeSantis said last week, infuriating longtime community activists who say the answer is not to isolate an already overlooked population but rather to help improve its working and housing conditions.

“There’s a big disincentive to take care of oneself and take care of one’s co-workers,” said Laura Safer Espinoza, executive director of the Fair Food Standards Council, a Sarasota-based organization that works with tomato growers and migrant workers. She said that agricultural employers in Florida were largely exempt from having to compensate workers who stay home sick, and that workers often ignore their symptoms and show up for work. “There’s a big fear of missing a paycheck,” she said.

Farmworkers tend to be younger and more fit than the rest of the population and may not suffer as severely from the virus. Some of them joke, in gallows humor, that if the tomato fertilizer has not killed them yet, maybe the virus will not.

While many are guest workers on temporary visas, others are undocumented, with little access to routine health care and an ingrained fear of the authorities.

In Immokalee, local leaders have pledged to keep Immigration and Customs Enforcement away from testing clinics, hospitals and isolation wards, but some farmworkers have given inaccurate names or addresses when they get tested, making contact tracing more difficult, said Kristine M. Hollingsworth, a health department spokeswoman. After realizing that sick people refused to be isolated in hotel rooms 45 minutes away in Naples, Collier County, commissioners signed off last week on renting dorms in Immokalee.

Some growers — especially those in the Fair Food Program, which allows for the monitoring of workplace conditions — have added hand-washing stations, required facial coverings and leased more buses to give farmworkers more space. Kent Shoemaker, chief executive of Lipman Family Farms, said guest worker crews lived spread out in on-site housing. The company gets workers’ grocery lists to shop for them so they do not have to go into the store.

Not all growers have taken similar precautions. Alfie Oakes, president of Oakes Farms, has falsely claimed that the virus is a “hoax” and denied that any workers on his properties had gotten sick — though the Fox affiliate in Southwest Florida reported that one laborer died at an Orlando hospital. Steve Veneziano, a company vice president, declined to comment to The New York Times.

(Both critics and supporters of Mr. Oakes demonstrated outside of the company’s Naples grocery store on Saturday and in Immokalee on Tuesday after he also called the Black Lives Matter movement a “hoax.”)

The Collier County medical examiner does not track coronavirus deaths by city, so fatalities in Immokalee have been shared by word of mouth.

“Did you hear about Mrs. Sara?” Alejandrina Carrera, a farmworker, asked Nely Rodríguez on her front porch last week, as a rooster crowed nearby. “She went sick to Georgia, and they found her dead there.”

A 17-year-old survived Covid-19 only after spending time in intensive care at an NCH Healthcare System hospital, where the teenager was hooked onto a heart-lung bypass machine, said Dr. David H. Lindner, the hospital’s medical director of intensive and respiratory care.

“That was one of the youngest and sickest we’ve had,” he said.

The Rev. Miguel Estrada of Misión Peniel, a social justice ministry that distributes vegetables, bread loaves and cookies from its parking lot weekly, said he knew of one family that had 30 people who contracted the virus. Gloria Padilla, the local coordinator for the Redlands Christian Migrant Association, said her mother was hospitalized with Covid-19 for two days, and a brother, sister, brother-in-law and nephew had all fallen ill.

Among those who have recovered is Ma-Belén Guerrero, 44, a housekeeper at a Naples golf and country club who shares an apartment with her boyfriend and his two children. She isolated in one bedroom, the children in the other, and her boyfriend in the living room.

“All locked up in here, we don’t have money for rent or for food,” said Ms. Guerrero, who makes $11 an hour. “We just don’t make enough to be in quarantine for so many days.”

Public health officials worry that the spiking numbers in Immokalee may not remain localized for long, as migrant farmworkers increasingly go north to follow the work. Thousands make the trip out of Immokalee each year, according to the Coalition of Immokalee Workers.

Despite the financial hardship, some Immokalee residents are so scared about getting infected far from their families that they plan to forgo the harvest up north.

“I’m trying to take care of myself — for my wife, for my baby,” said Wilson Pérez, 30, who lives in a trailer with his wife, their three children and two other laborers. Their belongings — bikes, a stroller, toys, potatoes, a filing cabinet — spill out into the back.

Ms. Carrera, 38, said she had planned to leave her three children in her sister’s care.

“But I decided better not,” she said. “I’m staying here.”"
"On the Future, Americans Can Agree: It Doesn’t Look Good","Brendan Hermanson, 51, a construction worker for three decades, has come through the pandemic healthy and employed. At home in Milwaukee, where he lives with his grown son, he tries to tune out the hostile politics in the country and wonders if he should bother to vote again for President Trump in November or “sit back and watch it crumble.”

In the Philadelphia suburbs, Basil Miles, 27, isn’t as comfortable. He worries about his ability to provide for his pregnant partner and their 3-year-old daughter after he was laid off from his food service job because of the coronavirus. He recently skipped a doctor’s appointment in the city because he feared armed white vigilantes who were threatening black protesters in the area.

“You don’t know what’s going to happen next,” said Mr. Miles, who is black. “There’s still protests, and there’s still stuff getting lit on fire.”

Mr. Miles and Mr. Hermanson are 700 miles apart, leading lives separated by lines of race, age, ideology and income. Yet there’s one opinion they both share: The American experiment is teetering.

“It’s all screwed,” said Mr. Hermanson, who is white. “It seems to me that we’re pretty close to a fall.”

Five months from a crucial presidential election, the usual political debates, campaign events and policy fights have faded into the background for voters battered by a public health crisis, struggling through an economic recession and boiling over with fury over racial inequities. With tens of millions unemployed, more than 110,000 killed by the coronavirus and thousands of people protesting in the streets, Americans see their personal concerns and political choices through a strikingly existential lens — mourning the past, worried about the present and fearful of the future.

In interviews with more than two dozen voters in key political battleground states, Republicans, Democrats and independents of diverse ages, races and social classes expressed worries that their nation had careened off track, with problems no election could easily solve. Fiercely polarized over public health, public safety and, perhaps, truth itself, many people are united only in their collective anxiety.

Mr. Trump has done little to soothe the angst, offering few new policy proposals and plenty of pointed warnings that Democrats would make the country worse. He has offered an incendiary response, invoking “law and order,” promoting conspiracy theories and pushing hard for the nation to reopen despite rising case numbers.

The presumptive Democratic nominee, Joseph R. Biden Jr., has spoken emotionally about those killed by the virus and the death of George Floyd, advocated new police reforms and urged Americans to rise to the challenge of the times. But he has struggled to break though the crush of news and connect with young voters, some of whom desire greater change than the promise of a return to normalcy that has fueled his campaign.

Yara Cabrera, a special-education teacher in Phoenix, blames Mr. Trump for the sometimes chaotic protests, arguing that he stokes racial division and lacks the empathy to help heal the wounds of racism. Ms. Cabrera, a self-identified “strong Democrat” and Latina, also expects that he’ll be re-elected.

Even if she’s wrong, and Mr. Biden wins, Ms. Cabrera, 36, has little hope that the country will turn around.

“I think people are too messed up right now,” she said. “I don’t think it matters who’s president.”

The level of worry and disillusionment marks a unique moment in American public life, according to historians. In the 1930s, Americans faced the hardships of the Great Depression. Thirty years later, the United States hurtled through the tumultuous 1960s, grappling with the politics of the Cold War and the Vietnam War, shocking assassinations and the rise of revolutionary social movements like civil rights and feminism.

Now, Americans are living through the social and economic unrest of both decades simultaneously, along with a historic pandemic. And it’s all filtered through the divisive lens of social media.

“You have a combination of the 1930s and the 1960s, this kind of converging of crises,” said Meena Bose, the director of the Peter S. Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra University. “I’m not sure there is an exact parallel, particularly given the rise of social media and how much easier it is to denigrate and attack than it is to have the kinds of thoughtful, hard conversations that are needed.”

Polling shows the cost of constant crisis on the American psyche. For the past two decades, a majority of Americans have consistently described themselves as optimistic about the country’s future. In April, 61 percent of registered voters said they were largely hopeful about the nation, in a survey by NBC News/The Wall Street Journal.

Eighty percent of voters now believe the country is spiraling out of control, according to a new poll released by the news organizations this week, with a majority both pessimistic that the United States can return to normal before next year and worried that someone in their immediate family could catch the virus.

A third of Americans were showing signs of clinical anxiety or depression at the end of April, according to an emergency weekly survey of American households carried out by the Census Bureau to measure the pandemic’s effects. In early May, half of those surveyed said they felt “down, depressed or hopeless,” double the number who responded that way in a 2014 national survey.

“This is the scariest thing I’ve ever seen in my life,” Erik Widener, 28, the manager of a restaurant in Doylestown, Pa., said on his way to work last week for the first day of the state’s reopening for food-service establishments.

Mr. Widener, who is white, added that “my generation, and maybe the generation before me, we haven’t really faced mentally difficult things to adjust to.”

In the mostly black Germantown section of northwest Philadelphia, Harold Smith, a veteran with a disability, said the series of extraordinary national events had left people feeling unmoored.

“We’re living in a world of uncertainty right now, with the pandemic and the powers that be not having the answers,” said Mr. Smith, 58, who is black. “It’s left people with a mind-set of uncertainty. We need to come up with the cure so that America can get back to being America.”

Jaimie Geddes, a 33-year-old from Doylestown who recently lost her grandmother to the coronavirus, said she was not convinced the country would ever return to its former strength.

“I don’t feel like we have a handle on it,” said Ms. Geddes, who is white. “I don’t feel that we are going to be able to go back to normal life — ever.”

While the majority of Americans feel a sense of unease, their response to the dueling crises of the pandemic and the protests diverges along partisan lines.

Nearly three-quarters of Democrats said it might take the next year or even longer to curb the virus and return to work as normal, according to the new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. Almost a third of Mr. Trump’s strongest supporters within the Republican Party said the virus was already contained.

About half of all Republicans said they were more concerned about the protests than the policing that led to Mr. Floyd’s killing, while 81 percent of Democrats held the opposite opinion.

In downtown Philadelphia, Carmelo Giargiari, 74, a stock market day trader sporting a “Trump 2020” pin in his baseball hat, predicted that the economy would rebound to a stronger position than where it was before the virus shutdown, pointing out that the global death toll in the pandemic so far is dwarfed by that of Spanish flu in 1918.

“A lot of people are overreacting,” Mr. Giargiari, who is white, said as he walked through Rittenhouse Square, a wealthy area. “We’ve been through tough times, and people thought it was the end of the world, but people come through.”

Christian Miranda, a cook at a Milwaukee burger joint, feels far less secure as he prepares to cast his first vote in a presidential election.

The protests in Milwaukee have left Mr. Miranda, who moved from Puerto Rico nine years ago, feeling unsafe, though he strongly disliked Mr. Trump’s labeling of protesters as terrorists and his desire to deploy federal troops to cities. He grades Mr. Trump’s response on the coronavirus as so-so.

But he may still support the president, calling him “ruthless” in a good way.

“I don’t want to be on his side, but the enemy of my enemy is my friend,” Mr. Miranda said. “The enemy is the riots and Covid-19 and whatever else is going on in the government they aren’t telling us.”

A new wave of national polling shows Mr. Biden with a significant lead in the race, placing him in a stronger position to oust an incumbent president than any challenger since Bill Clinton in the summer of 1992. While Mr. Biden’s margins are tighter in key battleground states, he’s consistently ahead in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Recent polling shows him locked in a tight race in states considered more favorable to Republicans, including Ohio, Florida and even Texas, which hasn’t gone to a Democrat since 1976.

Mr. Trump’s standing has fallen even among some demographic groups that helped him to victory four years ago, including voters without college degrees, white men and evangelicals. Much of Mr. Biden’s gains come from cutting into Mr. Trump’s coalition, given that the former vice president has not made substantial gains with nonwhite voters.

Still, after spending four years shocked by Mr. Trump’s victory in 2016, some Democrats remain skeptical that their party could defeat him.

As hundreds of peaceful protesters marched through the streets of downtown Detroit last week, there was a sense of resigned inevitability surrounding Jay Bidden and K.K. Bell, as they drank ice-cold Budweisers and ate pizza on Belle Isle, an island park that was filled with picnickers looking for a respite from the viral outbreak and the civil unrest that have rocked the city.

Both Mr. Bidden and Ms. Bell, who are black, believe that Mr. Trump has stirred up tremendous racial discord and will pound away at Mr. Biden enough to win re-election. They both think their votes won’t make a difference.

“Revelations talks about the end of time, and this may be it,” said Ms. Bell, a caregiver at a rehabilitation center in Dearborn.

In Milwaukee, Mr. Hermanson said that if he does vote in November, it will be for Mr. Trump. Twelve years ago, he supported Barack Obama, but in 2016 he backed Mr. Trump.

The president “speaks like an idiot” and “shoots from the hip” and is “borderline crazy,” but maybe that’s what America needs when all hell is breaking loose, Mr. Hermanson said.

No matter who wins, the task ahead is overwhelming. Emerging intact will involve a player far more powerful than the president, Mr. Hermanson said.

“We need divine intervention,” he said.

How Trump’s Idea for a Photo Op Led to Havoc in a Park,"WASHINGTON — After a weekend of protests that led all the way to his own front yard and forced him to briefly retreat to a bunker beneath the White House, President Trump arrived in the Oval Office on Monday agitated over the television images, annoyed that anyone would think he was hiding and eager for action.

He wanted to send the military into American cities, an idea that provoked a heated, voices-raised fight among his advisers. But by the end of the day, urged on by his daughter Ivanka Trump, he came up with a more personal way of demonstrating toughness — he would march across Lafayette Square to a church damaged by fire the night before.

The only problem: A plan developed earlier in the day to expand the security perimeter around the White House had not been carried out. When Attorney General William P. Barr strode out of the White House gates for a personal inspection early Monday evening, he discovered that protesters were still on the northern edge of the square. For the president to make it to St. John’s Church, they would have to be cleared out. Mr. Barr gave the order to disperse them.

What ensued was a burst of violence unlike any seen in the shadow of the White House in generations. As he prepared for his surprise march to the church, Mr. Trump first went before cameras in the Rose Garden to declare himself “your president of law and order” but also “an ally of all peaceful protesters,” even as peaceful protesters just a block away and clergy members on the church patio were routed by smoke and flash grenades and some form of chemical spray deployed by shield-bearing riot officers and mounted police.

After a day in which he berated “weak” governors and lectured them to “dominate” the demonstrators, the president emerged from the White House, followed by a phalanx of aides and Secret Service agents as he made his way to the church, where he posed stern-faced, holding up a Bible that his daughter pulled out of her $1,540 MaxMara bag.

The resulting photographs of Mr. Trump striding purposefully across the square satisfied his long-held desire to project strength, images that members of his re-election campaign team quickly began recirculating and pinning to their Twitter home pages once he was safely back in the fortified White House.

The scene of mayhem that preceded the walk — barely 1,000 feet from the symbol of American democracy — evoked images more commonly associated with authoritarian countries, but that did not bother the president, who has long flirted with overseas strongmen and has expressed envy of their ability to dominate.

Throughout his time in office, Mr. Trump has generated concern over what critics see as his autocratic instincts, including his claims to untrammeled power to “do whatever I want,” his attacks on quasi-autonomous institutions of government like the F.B.I. or inspectors general and his efforts to discredit independent sources of information that anger him, like the news media he denounces as the “enemy of the people.”

And when the history of the Trump presidency is written, the clash at Lafayette Square may be remembered as one of its defining moments.

Mr. Trump and his inner circle considered it a triumph that would resonate with many middle Americans turned off by scenes of urban riots and looting that have accompanied nonviolent protests of the police killing of a subdued black man in Minneapolis.

But critics, including some fellow Republicans, were aghast at the use of force against Americans who posed no visible threat at the time, all to facilitate what they deemed a ham-handed photo opportunity featuring all white faces. Some Democratic senators used words like “fascist” and “dictator” to describe the president’s words and actions.

Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, who was not consulted beforehand, said she was “outraged” over the use of one of her churches as a political backdrop to boast of squelching protests against racism. Even some White House officials privately expressed dismay that the president’s entourage had not thought to include a single person of color.

Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington sharply objected on Tuesday and said the federal government had even privately broached the idea of taking over the city’s police force, which she pledged to resist. “I don’t think the military should be used in the streets of American cities against Americans,” she said, “and I definitely don’t think it should be done for a show.”

Arlington County in suburban Virginia withdrew its police from those assembled to guard the White House and other federal sites after the Lafayette Square clash. Even beforehand, Democratic governors in Virginia, New York and Delaware refused to send National Guard troops requested by the Trump administration.

The spectacle staged by the White House also left military leaders struggling to explain themselves in response to criticism from retired officers that they had allowed themselves to be used as political props. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, put out word through military officials that they did not know in advance about the dispersal of the protesters or about the president’s planned photo op, insisting that they thought they were accompanying him to review the troops.

The police action cleared the way for the photo op, but it hardly quelled the anger in the streets. By Tuesday afternoon, demonstrators had returned to the edge of Lafayette Square — where new tall fences had been erected overnight — and shouted their discontent at the line of black-clad officers.

“Take off the riot gear, I don’t see no riot here,” they chanted.

Aides on Tuesday defended Mr. Trump’s walk to the church, given that a small fire had been set in its basement during demonstrations over the weekend. “The president very much felt when he saw those images on Sunday night — that crossed a terrible line, that goes way beyond peaceful protesting,” Kellyanne Conway, his counselor, told reporters.

But she distanced him from the decisions on how to disperse the crowd. “Clearly, the president doesn’t know how law enforcement is handling his movement,” she said.

This account of the clash is based on descriptions by reporters at the scene, interviews with dozens of protesters, White House aides, law enforcement officials, city leaders and others involved in the tense day as well as an analysis of video footage from The New York Times’s visual investigations team.

Mr. Trump was stirred up on Monday morning as he met with national security and law enforcement advisers to discuss what could be done about the street unrest. The advisers told him that he could not let the nation’s capital be overrun, that the symbolism was too important and that he had to get it under control that night.

Among the ideas put on the table was invoking the Insurrection Act, a two-century-old law that would enable the president to send in active-duty military to quell disturbances over the objections of governors. The act has long been controversial. President George Bush invoked it in 1992 to respond to the Rodney King riots only at the request of California. But in the civil rights era, presidents sent in troops to enforce desegregation over the resistance of racist governors.

Its use is so charged that President George W. Bush hesitated to invoke it to respond to Hurricane Katrina for fear of looking like he was overriding local and state leaders.

Vice President Mike Pence favored the idea, reasoning that it would allow quicker action than calling up National Guard units, and he was backed by Mr. Esper. But Mr. Barr and General Milley warned against it. The attorney general cited concerns about states’ rights, while General Milley assured the president that he had enough force already in the nation’s capital to secure the city and expressed worry about putting active-duty soldiers in such a role.

Several officials came away with different impressions of where Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, stood on the issue, but the discussion grew increasingly heated as voices were raised and tensions escalated.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence then conducted a conference call with the nation’s governors in which the president berated them for being “weak” and “fools,” advising them to “dominate” the demonstrators. Mr. Esper talked about controlling “the battlespace.”

The president rhapsodized about the crackdown in Minneapolis once the National Guard moved in. “It’s a beautiful thing to watch,” he said. “It just can’t be any better. There’s no experiment needed. You don’t have to do tests.”

In Washington, Mr. Barr was in charge of the federal response and an alphabet soup of agencies had contributed officers, agents and troops to defend the White House and other federal installations, including the Secret Service, the United States Park Police, National Guard, Capitol Police, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Marshal’s Service, the Bureau of Prisons, Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Mr. Barr was concerned about demonstrations near the White House over the weekend that had resulted in a small basement fire at St. John’s and graffiti on the Treasury Department headquarters, so he resolved to push the security perimeter farther from the mansion.

Reinforcements were summoned. Just before noon, an alert went out to every Washington-area agent with Homeland Security Investigations, a division of ICE, telling them to prepare to assist with any demonstration, according to an email labeled with a “high” severity. The F.B.I. deployed its elite hostage rescue team, highly armed and trained agents more accustomed to arresting dangerous suspects than dealing with riots. And ICE deployed its “special response teams” to protect agency facilities and be on call for more.

But others were reluctant to help. Mr. Trump was so aggressive on the call with governors that when Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia received a request to send up to 5,000 of his state’s National Guard troops, he grew concerned. His staff contacted Ms. Bowser’s office and discovered that the mayor had not even been notified of the request. At that point, Mr. Northam turned the White House down. Similarly, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York called off buses of National Guard troops that were to head to Washington.

By midafternoon on Monday, protesters had gathered again on H Street at the north side of Lafayette Square, this time peacefully. The Rev. Gini Gerbasi, the rector of St. John’s Church in Georgetown and a former assistant rector at St. John’s, arrived around 4 p.m. with cases of water for the demonstrators. Joining her on the church patio were about 20 clergy members who passed out snacks.

Next to them on the patio, a group affiliated with Black Lives Matter mixed water and soap in squeeze bottles as emergency eye wash if protesters were tear-gassed by the police.

While there were occasionally some aggressive encounters with the police, Ms. Gerbasi said, it was largely calm. “There were a few tense moments,” she said. “But it was peaceful.”

Inside the White House nearby, Mr. Trump was coming up with his plan to walk to the church. Several administration officials said it was his own idea; two officials said that during a senior staff meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Meadows credited the president’s daughter. It was crafted during an Oval Office meeting the day before that included Ms. Trump; Mr. Meadows; Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser; and Hope Hicks, another top adviser.

At some point, Anthony Ornato, a Secret Service veteran who serves as deputy chief of staff for operations, was brought in to coordinate the logistics of the visit. Ms. Hicks came up with the visuals for how it would look. But officials privately conceded that little thought was given to what Mr. Trump would do once he actually got to the church. There was some discussion of going inside, but it was boarded up.

The president and his team decided he would first make a statement in the Rose Garden in which he would express sympathy for the family of George Floyd, the black man who died in Minneapolis when a police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes, but then he would take a strong stance in favor of reclaiming the streets. He would threaten to invoke the Insurrection Act if governors and mayors did not do a better job of security. Reporters were told a statement would be coming, but the march to the church was kept a secret.

Mr. Barr made a trip out of the White House and into Lafayette Square only to find that the plan to expand the security perimeter had not been carried out. He ordered the law enforcement officers on the ground to complete the expansion, which would mean dispersing protesters, but there was not enough time to do so before the president’s planned statement.

At 5:07 p.m., National Guard trucks loaded with troops headed north on West Executive Avenue, a lane on the White House compound between the West Wing and the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, and drove past the visitors’ entrance, went out the gates and turned right onto Pennsylvania Avenue.

Shortly after, two members of the Secret Service counterassault team appeared on the roof of the West Wing with guns and binoculars, peering north toward Lafayette Square. While snipers are stationed on the main roof of the White House from time to time, they are not usually deployed on top of the West Wing, and the sight was jarring for regulars at the building.

The White House press corps was summoned to the Rose Garden at 6:03 p.m. Outside the gates and across Lafayette Square, some of the officers in riot gear kneeled down and some protesters initially thought they were expressing solidarity as the police have done in other cities, but in fact they were putting on their gas masks.

At 6:17 p.m., a large phalanx of officers wearing Secret Service uniforms began advancing on protesters, climbing or jumping over barriers at the edge of the square at H Street and Madison Place. Officials said later that the police warned protesters to disperse three times, but if they did, reporters on the scene as well as many demonstrators did not hear it.

Some form of chemical agent was fired at protesters, flash bang grenades went off and mounted police moved toward the crowds. “People were dropping to the ground” at the sound of bangs and pops that sounded like gunfire, Ms. Gerbasi said. “We started seeing and smelling tear gas, and people were running at us.”

By 6:30 p.m., she said, “Suddenly the police were on the patio of St. John’s Church in a line, literally pushing and shoving people off of the patio.”

Julia Dominick, a seminarian with the Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria, Va., and a former emergency room nurse, was tending to a hurt protester when a police line advanced.

“There was not a warning,” she said. “I’ve never been in a war. I’ve never been shot at. I’ve never been afraid in that way. Those sounds and the gas, it will be with me.” (No police agency acknowledged using tear gas, but reporters and protesters on the scene said there was clearly a chemical irritant of some kind.)

At 6:43 p.m., Mr. Trump made his statement in the Rose Garden, finishing seven minutes later, and then headed back through the White House to emerge on the north side and walk out the gates and into the park. Mr. Barr, Mr. Esper, General Milley, Mr. Meadows, Ms. Trump, Mr. Kushner and others followed him, but Mr. Pence and his staff hung back as the building emptied and watched on television instead.

The president’s movement surprised nearly everyone, as he intended, including law enforcement. The Washington police chief said he was notified only moments beforehand. Park Police commanders on the scene were as surprised as everyone else to see the president in the park.

When he reached St. John’s, Mr. Trump made no pretense of any intent other than posing for photographs — he held up the Bible carried by his daughter, then gathered a few top advisers next to him in a line. He made no formal remarks and then, having accomplished his purpose, headed back to the White House, passing in front of a wall with new graffiti saying, “Fuck Trump.”

The police and other forces pursued demonstrators around the capital the rest of the evening, with military helicopters even swooping low overhead in what were called shows of force. Mr. Barr and General Milley at different points roamed the streets.

By Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump boasted of success. “D.C. had no problems last night,” he wrote on Twitter. “Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!).”

By Tuesday afternoon, the crowds were back and even bigger.

Protesters Hail Charges Against Police but Seek Broader Change,"This live briefing has ended. Click here for the latest updates.

Minnesota officials charged three more former police officers on Wednesday in the death of George Floyd and added an upgraded charge against the former officer who pressed his knee to Mr. Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes.

From coast to coast, protesters had a consistent reaction to the announcement: It’s great news, they said — and it’s not nearly enough. There need to be convictions. There needs to be systemic change.

“I think it’s going to be a really long fight, not just in Minnesota but in cities around the country,” said Izzy Smith, an educator from the South Side of Minneapolis who was among those demonstrating at the site where Mr. Floyd was arrested last month.

“This is a marathon, not a sprint,” she added, “so it’s keeping the foot on the gas, but keep it steady.”

Nearby, Marquise Bowie said of the charges: “That’s good. It ain’t going to bring the man back, though. It’s a start.”

Some protesters expressed disappointment that the officer who pressed on Mr. Floyd’s neck had been charged with second-degree murder rather than first-degree, or that action against the other officers was not taken sooner.

“It’s about damn time,” said Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights lawyer and protest organizer in Minneapolis. If not for the outrage that had rocked the country, she said, “these officers never would’ve been charged.”

At a protest on the North Side of Chicago, Jonathan Mejias said he was gratified by the news — to a point.

“It’s just one piece,” he said. “The world needs to know that it doesn’t end with resolving this one case. There are too many more out there.”

Byron Spencer, handing out water and burgers to protesters outside Los Angeles City Hall, said he was both “elated and defeated” by word of the new charges. He said he had seen countless surges of outrage over police brutality against black men, only to have it happen again.

“I’m 55, I’m black and I’m male — I’ve seen the cycle,” he said. “It’s almost like PTSD constantly having this conversation with my son.”

Cierra Sesay reacted to the charges at a demonstration in the shadow of the State Capitol in Denver. “It’s amazing, it’s another box we can check,” she said. “But it goes up so much higher. It’s about the system.”

In San Francisco, Tevita Tomasi — who is of Polynesian descent and described himself as “dark and tall and big” — said he regularly faced racial profiling, evidence of the bigger forces that must be overcome.

On Wednesday, he distributed bottled water at what he said was his first demonstration, but one that would not be his last. What would stop him from protesting?

“They would have to shoot me.”

The Minneapolis Police Department late Wednesday released 235 pages of personnel records for the four former officers charged in George Floyd’s killing on May 25, all of whom were fired after video of his death emerged the next day.

Three of the officers, Thomas Lane, 37, J. Alexander Kueng, 26, and Tou Thao, 34, were charged on Wednesday with aiding and abetting second-degree murder, court records show. Mr. Kueng was in custody on Wednesday. The authorities said they were in the process of arresting Mr. Lane and Mr. Thao.

The fourth officer, Derek Chauvin, 44, who was arrested last week, now faces an increased charge of second-degree murder.

Many of the pages of the personnel files were heavily redacted, but they revealed details of the officers’ lives before joining the department and during their time on the force.

Mr. Chauvin appears to have been reprimanded and possibly suspended after a woman complained in 2007 that he needlessly removed her from her car, searched her and put her into the back of a squad car for driving 10 miles an hour over the speed limit.

Mr. Chauvin was the subject of at least 17 misconduct complaints over two decades, but the woman’s complaint is the only one detailed in 79 pages of his heavily redacted personnel file. The file shows that the complaint was upheld and that Mr. Chauvin was issued a letter of reprimand.

“Officer did not have to remove complainant from car, Could’ve conducted interview outside the vehicle,” read the investigators’ finding.

In one part of the records, the discipline imposed is listed as “letter of reprimand,” but Mr. Chauvin was also issued a “notice of suspension” in May 2008, just after the investigation into the complaint ended, that lists the same internal affairs case number.

Investigators wrote that there was no audio of the incident and that the dash cam “had been turned off during course of stop.”

The records say Mr. Chauvin admitted to leaving a microphone in the squad car during the traffic stop and “did not check” the dash cam at the start of his shift.

In applying to the Minneapolis Police Department, Mr. Chauvin said he had served as a member of the U.S. Army, working for a time as a member of the military police. He also said he had worked as a security guard and as a cook for McDonald’s and another restaurant in the mid-1990s. The records said he was hired by the department in January 2001 as a part-time community service officer.

Mr. Kueng had been an officer with the department for less than six months. He joined the force as a cadet in February 2019 and became an officer on Dec. 10, 2019, his personnel records show. He had previously worked as a community service officer with the department while he earned his bachelor’s degree in sociology at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.

He also worked as a security guard at a Macy’s and stocked shelves at a Target, and graduated from Minneapolis’s Patrick Henry High School in 2012.

Otherwise, most of his personnel file was blacked out, including basic details like whether he had a driver’s license, whether he lived in Minneapolis, whether he had any convictions for a long list of crimes and whether he is a U.S. citizen.

His file shows that he was terminated on May 26, the day after Mr. Floyd’s death, at 4:45 p.m. It says he was fired for substandard performance, misconduct and violations of the city’s use-of-force policy, including failure to stop another officer from applying inappropriate force.

Mr. Lane did not graduate from high school, his files shows, but he went on to get his G.E.D., then an associate degree from Century College, and a bachelor’s degree from the University of Minnesota in criminology.

He was accepted to the police academy in January 2019 but started working in the criminal justice system in 2017 as a probation officer. Mr. Lane previously worked a series of different jobs, from restaurant server to Home Depot sales associate. He volunteered at Ka Joog tutoring, working with Somali youth in Cedar Riverside.

Mr. Thao held jobs at McDonald’s, at a grocery store as a stocker and as a security guard before being hired in 2008 as a community service officer in Minneapolis. But he worked there less than two years before being laid off in late 2009 because of budget cuts. Almost two years later, in 2011, he was recalled, then hired as a police officer in 2012.

Mr. Thao graduated in 2004 from Fridley High School and attended North Hennepin Community College, where he studied for an associate degree in law enforcement but never graduated, according to his file.

transcript

It’s a Monday evening in Minneapolis. Police respond to a call about a man who allegedly used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. Seventeen minutes later, the man they are there to investigate lies motionless on the ground, and is pronounced dead shortly after. The man was 46-year-old George Floyd, a bouncer originally from Houston who had lost his job at a restaurant when the coronavirus pandemic hit. Crowd: “No justice, no peace.” Floyd’s death triggered major protests in Minneapolis, and sparked rage across the country. One of the officers involved, Derek Chauvin, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder. The other three officers have been charged with aiding and abetting murder. The Times analyzed bystander videos, security camera footage and police scanner audio, spoke to witnesses and experts, and reviewed documents released by the authorities to build as comprehensive a picture as possible and better understand how George Floyd died in police custody. The events of May 25 begin here. Floyd is sitting in the driver’s seat of this blue S.U.V. Across the street is a convenience store called Cup Foods. Footage from this restaurant security camera helps us understand what happens next. Note that the timestamp on the camera is 24 minutes fast. At 7:57 p.m., two employees from Cup Foods confront Floyd and his companions about an alleged counterfeit bill he just used in their store to buy cigarettes. They demand the cigarettes back but walk away empty-handed. Four minutes later, they call the police. According to the 911 transcript, an employee says that Floyd used fake bills to buy cigarettes, and that he is “awfully drunk” and “not in control of himself.” Soon, the first police vehicle arrives on the scene. Officers Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng step out of the car and approach the blue S.U.V. Seconds later, Lane pulls his gun. We don’t know exactly why. He orders Floyd to put his hands on the wheel. Lane reholsters the gun, and after about 90 seconds of back and forth, yanks Floyd out of the S.U.V. A man is filming the confrontation from a car parked behind them. The officers cuff Floyd’s hands behind his back. And Kueng walks him to the restaurant wall. “All right, what’s your name?” From the 911 transcript and the footage, we now know three important facts: First, that the police believed they were responding to a man who was drunk and out of control. But second, even though the police were expecting this situation, we can see that Floyd has not acted violently. And third, that he seems to already be in distress. Six minutes into the arrest, the two officers move Floyd back to their vehicle. As the officers approach their car, we can see Floyd fall to the ground. According to the criminal complaints filed against the officers, Floyd says he is claustrophobic and refuses to enter the police car. During the struggle, Floyd appears to turn his head to address the officers multiple times. According to the complaints, he tells them he can’t breathe. Nine minutes into the arrest, the third and final police car arrives on the scene. It’s carrying officers Tou Thao and Derek Chauvin. Both have previous records of complaints brought against them. Thao was once sued for throwing a man to the ground and hitting him. Chauvin has been involved in three police shootings, one of them fatal. Chauvin becomes involved in the struggle to get Floyd into the car. Security camera footage from Cup Foods shows Kueng struggling with Floyd in the backseat while Thao watches. Chauvin pulls him through the back seat and onto the street. We don’t know why. Floyd is now lying on the pavement, face down. That’s when two witnesses begin filming, almost simultaneously. The footage from the first witness shows us that all four officers are now gathered around Floyd. It’s the first moment when we can clearly see that Floyd is face down on the ground, with three officers applying pressure to his neck, torso and legs. At 8:20 p.m., we hear Floyd’s voice for the first time. The video stops when Lane appears to tell the person filming to walk away. “Get off to the sidewalk, please. One side or the other, please.” The officers radio a Code 2, a call for non-emergency medical assistance, reporting an injury to Floyd’s mouth. In the background, we can hear Floyd struggling. The call is quickly upgraded to a Code 3, a call for emergency medical assistance. By now another bystander, 17-year-old Darnella Frazier, is filming from a different angle. Her footage shows that despite calls for medical help, Chauvin keeps Floyd pinned down for another seven minutes. We can’t see whether Kueng and Lane are still applying pressure. Floyd: [gasping] Officer: “What do you want?” Bystander: “I’ve been —” Floyd: [gasping] In the two videos, Floyd can be heard telling officers that he can’t breathe at least 16 times in less than five minutes. Bystander: “You having fun?” But Chauvin never takes his knee off of Floyd, even as his eyes close and he appears to go unconscious. Bystander: “Bro.” According to medical and policing experts, these four police officers are committing a series of actions that violate policies, and in this case, turn fatal. They’ve kept Floyd lying face down, applying pressure for at least five minutes. This combined action is likely compressing his chest and making it impossible to breathe. Chauvin is pushing his knee into Floyd’s neck, a move banned by most police departments. Minneapolis Police Department policy states an officer can only do this if someone is, quote, “actively resisting.” And even though the officers call for medical assistance, they take no action to treat Floyd on their own while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. Officer: “Get back on the sidewalk.” According to the complaints against the officers, Lane asks him twice if they should roll Floyd onto his side. Chauvin says no. Twenty minutes into the arrest, an ambulance arrives on the scene. Bystander: “Get off of his neck!” Bystander: “He’s still on him?” The E.M.T.s check Floyd’s pulse. Bystander: “Are you serious?” Chauvin keeps his knee on Floyd’s neck for almost another whole minute, even though Floyd appears completely unresponsive. He only gets off once the E.M.T.s tell him to. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for over eight minutes, according to our review of the video evidence. Floyd is loaded into the ambulance. The ambulance leaves the scene, possibly because a crowd is forming. But the E.M.T.s call for additional medical help from the fire department. But when the engine arrives, the officers give them, quote, “no clear info on Floyd or his whereabouts,” according to a fire department incident report. This delays their ability to help the paramedics. Meanwhile, Floyd is going into cardiac arrest. It takes the engine five minutes to reach Floyd in the ambulance. He’s pronounced dead at a nearby hospital around 9:25 p.m. Preliminary autopsies conducted by the state and Floyd’s family both ruled his death a homicide. The widely circulated arrest videos don’t paint the entire picture of what happened to George Floyd. Crowd: “Floyd! Floyd!” Additional video and audio from the body cameras of the key officers would reveal more about why the struggle began and how it escalated. The city quickly fired all four officers. And Chauvin has been charged with second degree murder. Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao were charged with aiding and abetting murder. But outrage over George Floyd’s death has only spread further and further across the United States.

A longtime friend of George Floyd who was in the passenger seat of Mr. Floyd’s car when he was arrested said on Wednesday night that Mr. Floyd tried to defuse the tensions with the police and did not resist.

“He was, from the beginning, trying in his humblest form to show he was not resisting in no form or way,” said Maurice Lester Hall, 42, who was taken into custody in Houston on Monday and interrogated overnight by Minnesota state investigators, according to his lawyer.

“I could hear him pleading, ‘Please, officer, what’s all this for?’” Mr. Hall said in an interview with Erica L. Green of The New York Times on Wednesday night.

Mr. Hall recounted Mr. Floyd’s last moments.

“He was just crying out at that time for anyone to help because he was dying,” Mr. Hall said. “I’m going to always remember seeing the fear in Floyd’s face, because he’s such a king. That’s what sticks with me: seeing a grown man cry, before seeing a grown man die.”

Mr. Hall is a key witness in the state’s investigation into the four officers who apprehended Mr. Floyd.

Mr. Hall left Minnesota for Houston two days after Mr. Floyd died. After his arrest, which he was told was for outstanding warrants, he was questioned for hours only about Mr. Floyd’s death by a Minnesota state investigator, and then he was transferred to the county jail in Houston.

“I knew what was happening, that they were coming, it was inevitable,” Mr. Hall said in the interview. “I’m a key witness to the cops murdering George Floyd, and they want to know my side. Whatever I’ve been through, it’s all over with now, it’s not about me.”

George Floyd had the coronavirus in early April, nearly two months before he died, according to a full autopsy released by the Hennepin County medical examiner on Wednesday.

Dr. Andrew M. Baker, the county’s top medical examiner, said that the Minnesota Department of Health had swabbed Mr. Floyd’s nose after his death, and that he had tested positive for the virus, but that it was likely a lasting positive result from his previous infection.

There is no indication that the virus played any role in his death, and Dr. Baker said Mr. Floyd was likely asymptomatic at the time of his death.

Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner who was among two doctors who conducted a private autopsy for Mr. Floyd’s family last week, said county officials did not tell him that Mr. Floyd had tested positive for Covid-19.

“The funeral director wasn’t told, and we weren’t told, and now a lot of people are running around trying to get tested,” Dr. Baden said. “If you do the autopsy and it’s positive for the coronavirus, it’s usual to tell everyone who is going to be in touch with the body. There would have been more care.”

The four police officers who arrested Mr. Floyd should also get tested, as should some of the witnesses, Dr. Baden said. “I’m not angry,” he said. “But there would have been more care.”

The Hennepin County medical examiner released the full autopsy for George Floyd on Wednesday, June 3, 2020. (PDF, 20 pages, 0.27 MB)

Dr. Baden said the full autopsy included information he did not have access to, such as the toxicology results showing Mr. Floyd had fentanyl in his system. He added that when he conducted the autopsy, part of the heart was not provided — the part that showed coronary artery disease.

Lawrence Kobilinsky, a forensics expert at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said he was struck by the difference between the county’s official autopsy and the results of Dr. Baden’s private autopsy. The county’s report does not refer to any hemorrhaging near the carotid, as the private autopsy did.

Mr. Kobilinsky said defense lawyers could make a point of the amount of fentanyl in Mr. Floyd’s body. Although the amount required to be lethal varies from person to person, fentanyl can stop a person’s heart and breathing, he said. “It’s high enough where a defense attorney would argue that this kind of predisposes him to heart failure, when you are on a drug like this,” he said.

Dr. Baden acknowledged that the amount of fentanyl in Mr. Floyd’s body was “considerable,” which would be particularly important if he had never used the drug before.

“He has enough that could be a cause of death if he had never had immunity or tolerance to the drug,” Dr. Baden said. But there was nothing in the full autopsy that made him change his medical opinion. “Restraint is what caused the death,” he said.

Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, in his harshest criticism of the president since he resigned in protest in December 2018 over Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from eastern Syria, offered a withering criticism on Wednesday of the president’s leadership.

“Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people — does not even pretend to try,” Mr. Mattis said in a statement. “Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership.”

The statement came hours after the current Defense Secretary, Mark T. Esper, said he did not think the current state of unrest in U.S. cities warranted the deployment of active-duty troops to confront protesters. Mr. Esper’s comments directly contradicted President Trump, who has repeatedly raised the possibility of the Insurrection Act to do exactly that.

In a Pentagon news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Esper said ordering active-duty troops to police American cities should be a “last resort and only in the most urgent and dire of situations.” He said that, for now, this was not warranted.

transcript

The option to use active-duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort, and only in the most urgent and dire of situations. We are not in one of those situations now. I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act. Well, I did know that we were going to the church. I was not aware of a photo-op — was happening. Of course, the president drags a large press pool along with him. Look, I do everything I can to try stay apolitical, and to try and stay out of situations that may appear political. National Guard forces did not fire rubber bullets or tear gas into the crowd as reported. Second, guardsmen were instructed to wear helmets and personal protective equipment for their own protection, not to serve as some form of intimidation. Third, military leaders, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were wearing field uniforms because that is appropriate uniform when working in a command center and meeting with troops in the streets. Fourth, it wasn’t until yesterday afternoon that we determined it was a National Guard helicopter that hovered low over a city block in D.C. Within an hour or so of learning of this, I directed the secretary of the Army to conduct an inquiry to determine what happened and why. And to report back to me.

About 1,600 airborne troops and military police have been ordered to be positioned outside the capital, officials said on Tuesday night.

Attorney General William P. Barr has temporarily extended the power to make arrests and enforce federal criminal laws to officers from the Bureau of Prisons, who were asked this week to help clamp down on the demonstrations. All of the Justice Department law enforcement agencies, including the F.B.I. and the Drug Enforcement Administration, have been deployed to quell violence and looting.

To date, the troops that have assisted with protest response around the country have been National Guard forces under state control, and not active-duty military forces, which are prohibited from carrying out domestic law enforcement under most circumstances. On Wednesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida offered to send 500 Florida National Guard troops to Washington.

Officials said Mr. Trump had discussed invoking the Insurrection Act to permit use of active-duty troops but had been dissuaded by Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Mr. Barr.

Behind the concrete and metal barriers near the shuttered Gay 90’s nightclub, National Guard soldiers stood watching.

A peaceful protest on Wednesday outside the First Police Precinct in Minneapolis swelled to more than 500 people, and then dwindled to about 50 as the minutes ticked down to the 10 p.m. curfew.

Just after the curfew began, Nekima Levy Armstrong, a protest organizer and civil rights lawyer, addressed law enforcement.

“We have asked you to find your hearts, to find your humanity, to stop abusing people who are simply exercising their First Amendment constitutional right to freedom of speech,” she said.

Protesters handed out markers so people could write emergency phone numbers on their arms in case they were arrested. Others put on helmets, goggles and makeshift masks in case of tear gas.

Instead, Ms. Levy Armstrong kept talking, for almost another hour, about the arrests of the other three officers who arrested Mr. Floyd.

“Now we need to keep fighting and make sure that there is a conviction. Right?” she asked, as the crowd cheered. “So that means that we’ve got to keep the pressure on.”

Just before 11 p.m., she said the rally was over. As people got ready to leave, loudspeakers played “Get Up Stand Up” by Bob Marley.

The National Guard soldiers just stood watching.

Every Wednesday for the last two and a half years, Black Lives Matter has held a demonstration against police abuses in downtown Los Angeles, often drawing just a couple dozen people.

But on Wednesday there were many thousands gathered in front of the Hall of Justice, underscoring how the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis has catalyzed the work that local activists have been carrying out for years. Family members of young men who had been killed by the police in recent years told their stories.

“I can’t sleep at night,” said Fouzia Almarou, whose son Kenneth Ross Jr. was fatally shot by the police in Gardena in 2018. A man recounted how his brother Anthony Weber was killed in South Los Angeles after a Super Bowl party in 2018. Another woman carried a velvet box containing the ashes of her son, killed by law enforcement.

“We have been waiting for these days to come, for these people to stream into these streets,” said Valerie Rivera, whose son Eric was killed by the police in 2017.

“You keep hearing people say it’s horrible a black man was killed, but we have to stop the destruction,” said Bryon Spencer, 55, who has been out protesting all week. “It should be flipped. It’s horrible that there’s been this destruction, but we’ve got to stop the killing of black men.”

A multiethnic crowd including doctors in scrubs and students wearing black gathered in the Mission District, filling the streets next to Dolores Park.

William Achukwu, at 6 foot 6 inches, towered over his fellow San Franciscans.

“Our Declaration of Independence says life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” Mr. Achukwu said. “We are only dealing with the life part here,” he said of the protest. “This is a first step. But liberty is what a lot of people are marching for.”

Mr. Achukwu said his experiences as a black man in San Francisco, where he works for a technology company, had taught him that even in such a liberal city he is treated with fear.

People clutch their bags when he jogs through his neighborhood. His tenant brought a friend to the house and she thought he was there to clean. A police officer in Silicon Valley stopped him in his red Mustang convertible for drifting across lanes as he turned. The officer said, “Turn off your hip-hop when you’re talking to me.” He was listening to “My Way” by Frank Sinatra.

A number of years ago, he traveled to Tokyo and was walking through the streets late at night when he was approached enthusiastically by a child. “A little girl walked right up to me with no fear,” he said. “That’s never happened to me at home. Why?”

As the sun started to descend over Washington on Wednesday, a crowd of more than 1,000 protesters gathered peacefully. Sandwiches were distributed. An aging white Volvo had cookies in its trunk.

The security perimeter around the White House had grown. No longer were soldiers and police officers behind a chain link fence, as on the previous day. Instead the officers and troops had surged forward by half a block, forming a human line of riot shields, helmets and camouflage.

National Guard units, solidly ahead of the police near the White House, had seemingly become the public face of the security presence. They blocked the streets with 2.5-ton Army transport trucks.

Rai Jackson, a 39-year-old Methodist preacher joining the protest for the first time, said he wanted to see the situation before leading prayer next Sunday.

“My heart is broken,” Mr. Jackson said. “But at the same time it gives me hope.”

He added that he felt for troops lined up in front of him.

“I imagine that some of them would probably want to kneel with us,” he said. “My heart goes out to everybody who has to be in the middle of this, trying to go home and talk to their family about what side they’re on.”

“My heart breaks for them.”

A police officer in the Bay Area shot and killed a kneeling man after mistaking a hammer in the man’s pocket for a gun, the authorities said on Wednesday.

The shooting, which took place in Vallejo, Calif., early Tuesday, further incensed residents who have been protesting the death of George Floyd.

The man, Sean Monterrosa, who was Hispanic, was trying to flee a Walgreens that was being looted early Tuesday, said the city’s police chief, Shawny Williams.

Mr. Monterrosa, 22, a San Francisco resident, ran toward a car that had earlier rammed into a police cruiser and injured a different officer, Chief Williams said.

Mr. Monterrosa appeared to be running toward the car “but suddenly stopped, taking a kneeling position and placing his hands above his waist, revealing what appeared to be the butt of a handgun,” the chief said. “Investigations later revealed that the weapon was a long, 15-inch hammer.”

Chief Williams said the officer, whom he did not name, believed that Mr. Monterrosa posed a danger.

“Due to this perceived threat, one officer fired his weapon five times from within the police vehicle through the windshield” he said. Mr. Monterrosa was hit once and died.

The Solano County District Attorney’s Office and the Vallejo Police Department are conducting criminal investigations into the use of deadly force by the officer.

Los Angeles officials estimated that there have been at least 3,000 arrests in the nation’s second-largest city during the protests over the killing of George Floyd that began more than a week ago.

Most of the people arrested were cited for disobeying a curfew and released, a police spokesman said on Wednesday night.

The Los Angeles County district attorney, Jackie Lacey, said on Wednesday that 61 people had been charged with more serious crimes amid the protests, including looting, assaulting a police officer, robbery, burglary, possession of a destructive device, identity theft and receiving stolen property.

“I support the peaceful organized protests that already have brought needed attention to racial inequality throughout our society, including in the criminal justice system,” Ms. Lacey said. “I also have a constitutional and ethical duty to protect the public and prosecute people who loot and vandalize our community.”

On Tuesday, police officials gave an accounting of the arrests during a contentious meeting of the city’s police commission on a video conference. The commission, whose members are appointed by the mayor, issued a directive that requires police officers in the department to intervene when they see an officer using excessive force.

transcript

I filed an amended complaint. It charges, it charges former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin with murder in the second degree for the death of George Floyd. I believe the evidence available to us now supports the stronger charge of second-degree murder. Second, today arrest warrants were issued for former Minneapolis police officers J.A. Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao. Finally, I’d like to announce that today, Hennepin County Attorney Michael Freeman and I filed a complaint. It charges Police Officer Kueng, Lane and Thao with aiding and abetting murder in the second degree, a felony offense. I strongly believe that these developments are in the interest of justice for Mr. Floyd, his family, our community and our state.

Minnesota’s attorney general announced new charges on Wednesday against three former Minneapolis police officers who took part in the arrest of George Floyd, and an upgraded murder count for the fired officer at the center of the case.

The three officers, Thomas Lane, 37, J. Alexander Kueng, 26, and Tou Thao, 34, were charged with aiding and abetting murder, court records show. Mr. Kueng was in custody on Wednesday, county jail records showed. The authorities said they were in the process of arresting Mr. Lane and Mr. Thao.

The fourth officer, Derek Chauvin, 44, who was arrested last week, now faces an increased charge of second-degree murder.

“The very fact we have filed these charges means we have believed in them,” said the attorney general, Keith Ellison. “But what I do not believe is that one successful prosecution can rectify the hurt and loss that so many people feel.”

Mr. Chauvin kept his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, including for 2 minutes 53 seconds after Mr. Floyd fell unresponsive, according to the initial charging document released by prosecutors.

The other officers did not stop Mr. Chauvin, and Mr. Lane and Mr. Kueng helped hold Mr. Floyd to the ground for at least part of the time, while Mr. Thao stood nearby, according to video reconstruction of the arrest by The New York Times. Mr. Lane asked at one point whether they should turn Mr. Floyd onto his side, prosecutors said, but Mr. Chauvin said, “No, staying put where we got him.”

All four officers were fired from the Minneapolis Police Department after video of the fatal encounter emerged. But prosecutors faced growing calls for charges against them as anger and anguish over Mr. Floyd’s death sent demonstrators into the streets in cities and towns across the country.

Mr. Ellison asked the public for patience and cautioned that history showed the challenges of prosecuting police officers.

“Trying this case will not be an easy thing,” he said. “Winning a conviction will be hard.”

Mr. Chauvin was initially charged with third-degree murder, a charge that Mr. Floyd’s family criticized as too lenient. He was also charged with second-degree manslaughter. Mr. Ellison announced an addition of a second-degree murder charge on Wednesday.

In Minnesota, second-degree murder requires prosecutors to prove either that Mr. Chauvin intended to kill Mr. Floyd or that he did so while committing another felony. A court filing indicated that prosecutors planned to take the latter approach. Third-degree murder does not require an intent to kill, according to the Minnesota statute, only that the perpetrator caused someone’s death in a dangerous act “without regard for human life.”

Under Minnesota law, second-degree murder comes with a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison, and accomplices can be eligible for the same penalties as the primary defendant.

But if they are convicted, it is likely that the officers could get far less than that, under standard sentencing guidelines that suggest the equivalent of 12 years in prison for the typical second-degree murder case, said Richard Frase, a professor of criminal law at the University of Minnesota.

Dozens of U.S. cities remained under curfew Wednesday night, but some began relaxing their restrictions amid signs of a reduction in the widespread violence, vandalism and civil unrest that broke out across the country after the death of George Floyd on May 25 in Minneapolis.

Protests continued during the day and were largely peaceful, reinforcing hopes that the most serious convulsions had passed, especially after three more officers were charged in the death of Mr. Floyd. But each day since the turmoil began, serious trouble has not emerged until nighttime, leaving local and state officials again bracing for renewed disturbances as evening approached.

“The largest group of protesters that we have seen to this point have been doing a little bit of self-policing,” Peter Newsham, the police chief of Washington, D.C., said.

Washington moved back its curfew from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. In the afternoon, several hundred protesters lay face down on the pavement, as Mr. Floyd had, in eerie silence outside the Capitol.

Los Angeles County and the city of Los Angeles pushed back their curfews from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., and neighboring Santa Monica moved its curfew from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.

“We saw mass amounts of people protesting peacefully” last night, the county’s sheriff, Alex Villanueva said. “As a result, hopefully we can start altering the curfew.”

The mayor of Chicago, Lori Lightfoot, maintained a 9 p.m. curfew but reopened street access to the downtown area and allowed businesses there to reopen. The regional commuter rail system resumed service after being shut down for two days. And New York City, where there was extensive looting on Monday night, remained under an 8 p.m. curfew, a day after thousands of peaceful protesters defied it.

And Seattle’s mayor, Jenny A. Durkan, said on Twitter that the city’s police chief “believes we can balance public safety and ensure peaceful protests can continue without a curfew.”

“For those peacefully demonstrating tonight, please know you can continue to demonstrate,” Ms. Durkan added. “We want you to continue making your voice heard.”

Tammy Duckworth Is Battle Tested. Could She Help Joe Biden in His Biggest Mission?,"Dan Milberg is a retired Army helicopter pilot who voted for Donald J. Trump in 2016, and does not wish to vote for him again. But before he can consider pulling the lever for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., he needs to know who his running mate will be.

“It might be someone too progressive,” said Mr. Milberg, who lives in Robertsville, Mo.

The one person who would put him at ease, Mr. Milberg said, is the pilot whose seemingly lifeless body he lifted from a helicopter in 2004, her legs blown off by a rocket-­propelled grenade not far from Baghdad: Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois.

It is not so much the event that indelibly marked both of their lives and earned Ms. Duckworth a purple heart that draws him to her, Mr. Milberg said. Rather, he continued, she “is moderate enough that I think she can be appealing.”

Ms. Duckworth is among more than one dozen women who have been considered by the Biden campaign to join his ticket, and she is among a smaller group asked to submit documents for vetting. But she is rarely talked up by Washington’s consultant class.

She is not one of the Democratic senators who ran for the top job this cycle and then became part of the vice-presidential search. She is not from a battleground state; vice-presidential candidates often are. She is not among the running-mate contenders who are black; many leading Democrats feel Mr. Biden should choose a black woman, in part because of the growing public attention to and support for fighting systemic racism. Her politics are in some ways abstruse; she largely votes with her party but she is not particularly identified with any progressive cause, other than an often bipartisan distaste for protracted foreign entanglements.

But presidential candidates generally try to find a running mate who can both complement and highlight their own political qualities, and in that sense, some experts say, Ms. Duckworth fits the bill.

“Let’s say Biden makes this all about restoring decency in America — you are looking at people you think can help solidify that,” said Joel Benenson, a chief strategist for President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaigns.

“Tammy Duckworth has some policy chops,” he said. “She is obviously someone who has been prominent enough to speak at the last three Democratic conventions. She served in the House, she won a Senate seat and she brings credentials around armed services and veterans. She is center left, and you know I think that is where Biden is.”

Ms. Duckworth, who has two daughters, was the first senator to give birth while in office and the first to bring her newborn to the floor for a vote. Her mother is Thai of Chinese descent, and her father was a white veteran who fell on such hard times that Ms. Duckworth once helped support the family while growing up by selling flowers on the side of the road in Honolulu.

Her background and experience could prove a boon in places around the country that resemble Southern Illinois, firmly Trump territory but where she too has prevailed.

“I can push back against Trump in a way others can’t,” Ms. Duckworth said in a telephone interview from her car last week as she waited to attend a Juneteenth demonstration in Grant Park in Chicago.

“I can say, ‘Listen, that American flag is the same flag that would drape my father’s coffin, my coffin, my husband’s coffin and my brother’s.’ It has draped them for generations,” she said. “No one respects that flag more than I have. But I will respect the right to protest it, too.”

Two people with knowledge of the vetting process say that Ms. Duckworth’s early interviews with the Biden campaign were impressive enough to make her a contender.

[Follow along with The Times’s coverage of Joe Biden’s pick for Vice President.]

Ms. Duckworth, 52, was born Ladda Duckworth in Bangkok. Her father, who served two tours in Vietnam, moved the family around Asia as a program director for the United Nations and for the private sector. “I got to see America in many ways through the eyes of other nations,” she said. (She is fluent in Thai and Indonesian.)

He moved the family to Hawaii after losing his job, when Ms. Duckworth was in her last year of high school. The family was forced to live in a low-rent hotel in Waikiki with the financial help of a 90-year-old woman who volunteered at the local American Legion, making do with food stamps, school lunches and her odd jobs. “I learned about the kindness of people,” she said.

After graduating from the University of Hawaii, she headed to Washington to pursue a master of arts in international affairs at George Washington University, largely because she wanted to join the foreign service. While there, she joined the Army Reserve Officer Training Corps in part for the class credits.

“I didn’t crave to join the military,” she said. “But I just absolutely fell in love with the Army. Even during basic training, I, many times, locked myself in the latrines to cry my eyes out. But because it was so hard in the Army, it didn’t matter that I was a little Asian girl. It was all about, Can you shoot straight? Can you show leadership abilities?” She moved to Illinois and joined the Illinois National Guard in 1996.

Her colleagues in the military described Ms. Duckworth as deliberate and serious when in uniform, but jovial and even silly during downtime. “You’d be lying under the helicopter out in the sand,” Mr. Milberg said, “any subject could pop up and we would be making jokes and carrying on.”

In 2004, Randy Sikowski was an operations officer in the Illinois National Guard charged with finding commissioned officers for a mission to Iraq, and Ms. Duckworth was the first to raise her hand. The unit was stationed in Balad, known as “Mortaritaville” because of the constant incoming fire.

The day of the event that would change Ms. Duckworth’s life forever was “a pretty generic one,” Mr. Milberg said. They buzzed around moving people and supplies, stopped at a base in Baghdad to pick up some Christmas presents, then had a milkshake before making one last-minute pickup.

Ms. Duckworth had been doing the flying all day so Mr. Milberg requested to take the last flight, enjoying his gentle dives between the palm trees. Suddenly, about 15 minutes from their destination, three large noises and a pop echoed through the helicopter, which started shaking violently.

Mr. Milberg managed to land the aircraft on a small strip of open woods. Only then did he look over.

A grenade had punctured the floor of the cockpit near his partner.

“I saw Tammy leaning against the instrument panel. Her head was resting on it, facing me. Her face was grayish colored,” he recalled. “I pretty much thought the worst.”

He and others dragged her to safety through a large field.

“We were running through this stuff trying to carry her,” he said. “We would fall, get back up, walk two steps, fall.”

Mr. Sikowski did not see the woman he recruited for that mission again until the following year, when he went to see Ms. Duckworth at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. “I will never forget coming around the corner,” he said, choking back tears. “Tammy was in a wheelchair. I still remember what she said to me: ‘I don’t know how you made it there after I left.’ She was worried about me.”

That summer, Kevin Conlon, an activist who raises money for Democrats, got a call. “A person says, ‘This is Captain Tammy Duckworth. I am calling from Walter Reed Hospital. I was in Iraq, I got shot down, but I want to run for Congress. Can you help me?’” (She discharged herself from Walter Reed early in order to begin campaigning.)

Ms. Duckworth was already on the radar screens of Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, who had seen her testify at a hearing on military health care just a few months after her injury, and Rahm Emanuel, at the time a congressman in charge of the Democratic Party’s recruitment efforts for the 2006 election.

Mr. Emanuel was also making a big effort to get veterans to run.

“She is very methodical,” he said “We started to get to know each other before I actually recruited her.”

Ms. Duckworth narrowly lost that first bid in 2006 for an open seat in the Chicago suburbs to Representative Peter Roskam, a Republican. Weeks later, she was named director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. In 2009, she moved to the post of assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

In 2012, the Tea Party stalwart Joe Walsh, a first-term congressman, saw his House district redrawn to be more Democratic. Ms. Duckworth made another run, and she easily won.

Mr. Walsh still gripes about that 2012 race, describing it as one that Ms. Duckworth was “handpicked” to win. The Democrats, he said, “set her up with a wonderful congressional district that was impossible for me to win.”

Representative Cheri Bustos, another Illinois Democrat, said Ms. Duckworth has not had it easy. She recalled seeing her at a lunch event struggling with her tray and her lingering injuries. “It occurred to me to ask her, ‘Tammy, are you ever in pain?’ And she looked at me with a smile and said, ‘Yeah.’ That’s Tammy. She never complains.”

Four years after her first House win, just a few months after having her first child, she easily defeated Senator Mark S. Kirk, a Republican, in a race for the seat once held by Mr. Obama.

In the Senate, Ms. Duckworth is best known for working on veterans and military issues, like a bill to help reduce veteran suicide and to help returning veterans find jobs in the private sector.

Her dramatic military story endears her to audiences, but her hardscrabble upbringing and life as a working mom are what help her connect. “Once they let a soldier through the door at the Corn Growers Association, then I get to talk to them about everything else,” she said.

But she does not shrug away her brush with death.

“Not a day goes by that I don’t wake up and think of Dan carrying me through the field,” she said. “I wake up every day thinking I am never going to make Dan regret saving my life.”"
"On L.G.B.T.Q. Rights, a Gulf Between Trump and Many Republican Voters","When President George W. Bush needed to shore up support with social conservatives during his re-election run in 2004, he turned to a familiar political tactic: demonizing L.G.B.T.Q. rights. On the campaign trail and from the White House, the Republican leader began championing a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, praising unions between a man and woman as “critical to the well-being of families.”

Sixteen years later, when another issue of L.G.B.T.Q. rights popped up in the midst of another presidential campaign, the Republican incumbent responded with little more than a shrug.

“They ruled and we live with their decision,” President Trump told reporters after the Supreme Court issued a decision on Monday protecting the rights of L.G.B.T.Q. workers. “That’s what it’s all about. We live with the decision of the Supreme Court.”

For decades, most Republican leaders have opposed L.G.B.T.Q. civil and marriage rights, views that remain embedded in the party’s platform and its activist base. Last weekend, party activists in Virginia punished Representative Denver Riggleman, a first-term Republican, for officiating a same-sex marriage ceremony; they chose a self-described “biblical conservative” as their G.O.P. nominee for November. And the Trump administration continues to limit civil rights protections for transgender people and bar most of them from military service.

Yet today, widespread battles over L.G.B.T.Q. rights are less frequent among parts of the Republican Party — not just among some corporate leaders and political donors who dislike openly bigoted fights, but also among many of the rank-and-file Republicans who say in polling that they support at least some rights and protections for L.G.B.T.Q. people.

Last year, according to Pew, roughly three in five Americans said they supported same-sex marriage — up from half that share in 2004. Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 44 percent supported same-sex marriage last year, up from 19 percent. Wide majorities of the country also support extending workplace protections to L.G.B.T.Q. Americans, according to surveys taken before the Supreme Court’s ruling.

The consensus was so broad that last year, even among white Republican men over age 50 holding favorable views of Mr. Trump, 52 percent said that workplace protections and other nondiscrimination laws should apply to L.G.B.T.Q. people, according to a Public Religion Research Institute poll.

“On L.G.B.T. rights, everyone has moved on this issue,” Robert Jones, the founder of PRRI, said in an interview, referring to voters across the political spectrum. “Whether you’re talking about marriage equality, nondiscrimination protection — everybody has moved. Seniors have moved, white evangelicals have moved, base Republicans have moved.”

In interviews this week, several Republican voters in battleground states reacted to the Supreme Court ruling by expressing support broadly for civil rights for L.G.B.T.Q. people. Some were gently critical of Mr. Trump on points, while others said the most unexpected thing about the decision was that two Republican-nominated members of the court, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, joined the court’s four more liberal justices on the majority opinion, which Justice Gorsuch wrote.

“As conservatives, they usually go by the rule of law, so I was surprised,” said Wayne Bradley, 43, a Republican from Detroit. “But I’m comfortable with the decision they made. Everyone deserves respect and with all the other things that are going on in the world, maybe that played a part in their decision. Everybody deserves protection.”

Margie Dougherty, 61, a Republican and Trump backer from Bayside in suburban Milwaukee, said she believed the president was not taking the right approach with his restrictions on transgender people serving in the military.

“If a person can perform the duties of a job or role they are hired and trained for, then they should be allowed to do the job,” she said.

For many transgender and nonbinary Americans, however, changes in public opinion can be cold comfort given that prejudice and hate crimes remain a harsh reality in their lives. In interviews, some expressed concern that the new Supreme Court ruling could take the focus away from work that still needs to be done.

“The big picture is that employment is only one of many places where gay trans people are discriminated against,” said Patrick Cognato, an English major at Binghamton University who is nonbinary. “Things like health care, housing and education are really important, too, and have a serious effect on people’s everyday lives. People can’t wait for these to be addressed because it affects them every day.”

Last year, in a separate PRRI survey, 62 percent of Americans said that in recent years they had become more supportive of transgender rights, not less. Even a slim majority of white evangelicals — a Republican bastion — said they had grown more supportive.

But it was only five years ago that transgender Americans became a political target of Republicans trying to regulate the use of public bathrooms. Some political observers believe that the Republican focus on the issue backfired — particularly when a Democrat, Roy Cooper, won the governor’s race in North Carolina after the state’s “bathroom bill” became a flash point in the campaign. That legislation required transgender people in government and public buildings to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender on their birth certificate.

The law drew nationwide outrage, prompting companies to cancel planned expansions and move events out of the state, costing North Carolina jobs and tax revenue. Last year, the law was partially repealed by a federal judge.

Whatever the change in attitudes, however, transgender Americans remain heavily targeted for hate crimes, violence and discrimination. Black transgender people suffer disproportionate levels of police violence, and the American Medical Association said last fall that killings of transgender people, especially women of color, amounted to an epidemic.

If some Republicans have grown more accepting of L.G.B.T.Q. rights, Mr. Trump, his administration and the party leadership appear out of step with those parts of the base.

While Mr. Trump said in 2016, while running for president, that transgender people should be allowed to use whatever bathroom they feel most comfortable with, he rescinded protections for transgender students in 2017 that had allowed them to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity. In addition to the military ban, his administration moved last week to erase protections for transgender patients against discrimination by doctors, hospitals and health insurance companies.

“I cannot think of another administration that has gone out of its way to discriminate against transgender people specifically,” said Gabriel Arkles, a senior staff lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union working on L.G.B.T.Q. rights. “There are other administrations that were terrible for transgender people — the Reagan administration’s management of the H.I.V. epidemic, Clinton’s welfare and prison reform — but these weren’t situations where they were specifically naming transgender people in their policies.”

On other issues, Mr. Trump called same-sex marriage “settled law” shortly after taking office, but he also promised to “seriously consider” a Supreme Court justice who would once again outlaw the constitutional right. Congressional Republicans and Mr. Trump continue to resist the Equality Act, Democratic-sponsored legislation that would extend anti-discrimination rules for L.G.B.T.Q. Americans. And the executive committee of the Republican National Committee decided this month to carry over the 2016 party platform, which calls for a constitutional amendment overturning the 2015 Supreme Court decision that struck down laws defining marriage between one man and one woman.

With the president’s re-election prospects looking precarious at the moment, both Mr. Trump and some party leaders appear wary of antagonizing the loyal voters and activists in the most conservative parts of his base. Yet even some leaders on the right say that opposition to L.G.B.T.Q. protections doesn’t carry the same political potency that it once did in some of the most conservative quarters of the party.

“Religious freedom and the protection of unborn lift ranks far higher in the hierarchy of the concerns from faith-based voters,” said Ralph Reed, the chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, which works to drive evangelical voters to the polls.

On the campaign trail, most Republican elected officials now generally avoid broadcasting their opposition to same-sex marriage, except in select primary campaigns in deeply conservative districts. Meanwhile, a record number of L.G.B.T.Q. candidates won seats in the 2018 midterms, with 161 openly lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people elected, according to the Victory Fund, a nonpartisan political action committee devoted to electing L.G.B.T.Q. candidates. Most were Democrats.

Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster, said that what was once a hot-button issue for voters on the right had turned into something of a nonstarter.

“There was a period of concern over where things were moving on gay marriage: that a church that refused to marry a gay couple could be sued,” Mr. Goeas said in an interview. “The fact of the matter is, nothing’s really pushed it to that extent, everything’s sort of settled down into normalcy, and I don’t sense that it’s a big issue today.”

Even as national attitudes have evolved on questions around gender and sexuality, analysts said that the Republican Party under Mr. Trump has hardly let go of cultural issues altogether. It has simply shifted toward talking more about immigration and race, including in his attacks on protesters, immigrants and black celebrities.

“The new culture war is not abortion or same-sex marriage, the new culture war is about preserving a white, Christian America,” said Dr. Jones, the PRRI pollster. A 2019 poll from his organization found that, even as many Americans’ views on race had moved to the left in recent years, 69 percent of Republicans said they believed that discrimination against white people was just as much of a problem as discrimination against racial minorities.

“That’s what Trump’s really leading with,” Dr. Jones added. “The ‘Make America Great Again’ thing — the way that was heard by most white evangelical Protestants, white working-class folks, was saying: ‘I’m going to preserve the composition of the country.’”

"With the Federal Health Megaphone Silent, States Struggle With a Shifting Pandemic","WASHINGTON — The federal government’s leadership in the coronavirus crisis has so faded that state and local health officials have been left to figure out on their own how to handle rising infections and to navigate conflicting signals from the White House.

About 800 Americans a day are still dying of Covid-19, a pace that, if sustained over the next few months, would yield more than 200,000 dead by the end of September. Arizona, Florida, Nevada, Oregon and Texas all reported their largest one-day increases in new cases on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, Oklahoma recorded 259 new cases, a single-day record for the second day in a row, and just three days before President Trump is scheduled to hold an indoor campaign rally in Tulsa in defiance of his own administration’s guidelines for “phased reopening.”

Yet despite Mr. Trump’s assurances Wednesday night during a Sean Hannity interview that the virus is “fading away,” the Trump campaign is requiring rally-goers to sign a statement waiving their right to sue the campaign if they get sick.

That is hardly the only confused signal from Washington. While the president refuses to wear a mask, Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams has spent this week imploring Americans to do so. Meantime, Vice President Mike Pence insisted in an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal this week that panic over a second wave was “overblown.”

To public health experts, it is little mystery why Americans are confused. As the White House sends mixed messages, Washington’s public health bully pulpit has largely fallen silent.

“As states are moving to reopen the economy, as people are increasing their social activities, it becomes even more important that the public understand the critical value in following public health guidance — wearing masks, social distancing, washing hands, staying home if you’re sick,” said Dr. Richard Besser, a former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose regular briefings during the H1N1 pandemic of 2009 have been cited as a model of good crisis communications.

But, he added, “without that daily reinforcement, you have what is happening around the country — people not believing the pandemic is real, cases rising in some places and the possibility that some communities’ health care systems will get overwhelmed.”

In the early months of the pandemic, Mr. Trump made himself the center of daily coronavirus briefings, but when he ceded the lectern, health officials like Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, had a powerful platform to give guidance to the public.

But Mr. Trump gave up the daily appearances well over a month ago, after the ridicule that followed his suggestion that his health advisers look into injecting patients with disinfectants and using ultraviolet light inside their bodies. He took Dr. Fauci and another respected voice, Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the administration’s coronavirus response coordinator, offstage with him.

States have been left to make do. In North Carolina, as Gov. Roy Cooper privately appealed over the weekend to Mr. Pence for the federal government to set up 100 test sites, health officials sought guidance from academics on what to tell the public.

In Florida, a huge upswing in coronavirus cases has been greeted with a shrug from Gov. Ron DeSantis, who attributes it to “widespread testing of asymptomatic people.” With little guidance from the state or federal officials, the owners of some restaurants, bars and stores have shut down voluntarily until their entire staffs can get tested.

“It’s pretty nerve-racking to make decisions as business owners, and to not know if it’s dangerous or safe,” said Alsace Walentine, the owner of Tombolo Books in St. Petersburg, Fla., which is allowing customers inside by appointment only. “So we’re just going on our gut and on the information we can get every day.”

In Texas, the conflicting messages were on full display this week, when mayors from the state’s largest cities wrote a joint letter to Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, asking for the authority to require residents to wear masks in public. The governor’s statewide policies do not require that, although he encourages it.

“It is important for the messaging on the state, federal and local level to be as consistent as possible,” Mayor Sylvester Turner of Houston told reporters at a news conference on Wednesday, a black mask covering his face.

Left unsaid was that Mr. Trump has refused, by and large, to wear a face mask in public. When asked about what guidance, if any, he had received from the White House and the C.D.C. as cases in his city and state ticked upward, Mr. Turner, a Democrat, paused for 10 seconds.

“You did get that answer?” he asked wryly. “It wasn’t too nuanced, was it?”

A Texas supermarket chain, H-E-B, found itself torn between angry customers and hamstrung local officials when it gave up on enforcing mask requirements. Thousands signed an online petition in protest, but a company spokeswoman said that “without any guidance or rules from the local government like we had a couple of weeks ago, there is nothing to enforce.”

In Bexar County, Texas, which includes San Antonio, officials circumvented the governor’s order on Wednesday and issued a mask requirement inside businesses. H-E-B indicated it would, too, in areas with requirements.

In Washington, Mr. Trump’s coronavirus task force is going through a slow death. The group remains intact but meets only twice a week, often for just an hour, and without the public component. It is being gradually overtaken, in attention and resources, by Operation Warp Speed, the crash effort to develop a vaccine and have 100 million doses ready by the end of the year.

Dr. Fauci rarely speaks with Mr. Trump these days; he told National Public Radio this week that they had not talked in two weeks, when they met on vaccine development. At Wednesday’s task force meeting, Dr. Fauci called on the group to do a better job of informing the public on differences between a wave, a spike and a rise in cases because of testing.

“We’ve got to figure out a way to better communicate the difference between those things,” he said, according to a senior official present.

Dr. Birx, who runs the task force day to day, briefs the president on the pandemic less frequently than before, senior administration officials said. 

The man introduced to the nation months ago as the “testing czar,” Adm. Brett P. Giroir, has returned to his old job as assistant secretary of health to focus on a wide range of public health matters including childhood vaccination, the opioid epidemic and AIDS.

That has left the country with no singular public voices updating citizens, businesses and state and local governments on best practices. Where once there were voices, now there are just echoes — a promising study in Britain about a steroid that may save the lives of the sickest patients, new evidence of the benefits of staying outdoors. But there is no clarion federal guidance.

Past pandemics, and simulations conducted by the federal government to prepare for new ones, all teach the same lesson: Having clear, consistent and regular communication with the public is essential to managing any infectious disease outbreak. The C.D.C. has a 462-page manual for crisis communications, which it uses to train state and local health officials. 

“It’s a great guide, and it’s just been tossed out the window,” said Joshua M. Sharfstein, an expert in public health communications at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, who uses the manual in his classes.

In many states, governors have instituted their own regular coronavirus updates. Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon, a Democrat, had a news conference last week to announce a pause in reopening for seven days because of the spike in infections. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York became a darling of national Democrats with his own daily televised appearances. With the number of cases declining there, Mr. Cuomo announced on Wednesday that he would end the briefings on Friday.

“We did what we had to do, my friends, and we did it together, and we did it every day, and now we’re going to move on to other things,” the governor said.

In North Carolina, where the caseload has shot up to nearly 50,000 after the state’s stay-at-home order expired at the end of May, health officials conduct two or three briefings as week, often with Governor Cooper, a Democrat, in attendance. Privately, they have lamented the lack of clear, regularly updated guidance on communications from the C.D.C. on how to talk to the public about the coronavirus threat, according to a senior state official who did not want to be quoted criticizing the Trump administration.

Dr. Mandy Cohen, North Carolina’s health secretary, has been consulting with her counterparts from other states, as well as academics and Dr. Tom Frieden, a former C.D.C. director whose health advocacy group, Resolve to Save Lives, published a “playbook” on Tuesday to help states with their contact-tracing efforts.

In past public health crises, when the White House quit updating the public, the C.D.C. continued on its own. Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the agency, said in an email on Wednesday that the “C.D.C. has done a few recent briefings and is planning to do more in the future.” He said the agency had “produced vast amounts of information on Covid-19 for intended use by state and local health officials when communicating to the public.”

But written guidance to state officials is no substitute for a live human being talking directly to members of the public on a regular basis, health experts say. Direct communications instill public trust in government health officials — even when those officials make mistakes — because they can engage in a running conversation with the public, explaining that as the science changes, their recommendations may change as well, public health experts say.

“The American public is remarkably forgiving of mistakes when you’re upfront: ‘Here’s why I’m making this judgment now, and things are changing,’” said Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, a professor of bioethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania.

Some public health scientists and academics are talking about filling the void left by Washington and holding their own coronavirus briefings.

“I have thought about that,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, “but part of me feels like at the end of the day, this is why we have a government; they have access to data that we don’t and they can talk about policies and I can’t.”

The president’s own actions are further complicating matters.

For Mr. Trump, one member of the task force reported, the coronavirus is in the rearview mirror. Every announcement is supposed to focus on reopening and recovery. When he next appears to discuss the issue, aides say, it will most likely be to announce progress on a vaccine — even if no one can yet say which vaccine will win the race, or whether Chinese manufacturers will get there first.

"In Historic Vote, House Approves Statehood for the District of Columbia","WASHINGTON — The House of Representatives voted nearly along party lines on Friday to grant statehood to Washington, D.C., the first time a chamber of Congress has approved establishing the nation’s capital as a state.

The legislation, which is unlikely to advance in the Republican-led Senate, would establish a 51st state — Washington, Douglass Commonwealth, named in honor of Frederick Douglass — and allow it two senators and a voting representative in the House. The National Mall, the White House, Capitol Hill and some other federal property would remain under congressional jurisdiction, with the rest of the land becoming the new state.

The vote was 232 to 180, with every Republican and one Democrat voting “no.”

Republicans have long opposed the move to give congressional representation to the District of Columbia, where more than three-quarters of voters are registered Democrats, but the long-suffering movement for statehood, led by Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton, the capital’s lone nonvoting delegate, has been pressing for a vote on the matter for years.

When Democrats assumed the House majority last year, Ms. Norton secured a promise from leaders to bring up the bill for the first time in more than a quarter-century.

Anger over the Trump administration’s handling of racial justice protests — particularly the use of federal officers in the city and the violent removal of protesters from Lafayette Square outside the White House — further galvanized advocates of statehood and cast a national spotlight on how much control the federal government retains over more than 700,000 residents in the District of Columbia.

“Over the last few months, the nation, and even the world, has witnessed the discriminatory and outrageous treatment of D.C. residents by the federal government,” Ms. Norton said on Friday on the House floor, where she was unable to cast a vote for the bill she championed. “The federal occupation of D.C. occurred solely because the president thought he could get away with it here. He was wrong.”

The bill, which passed along party lines, is not expected to become law. The White House issued a veto threat against it on Wednesday, declaring the measure unconstitutional.

Republicans in the Senate, where the legislation would have to meet a bipartisan 60-vote threshold to advance, have rejected the idea, arguing that if representation for its citizens was the sole issue, the District of Columbia should simply be absorbed into Maryland, another heavily Democratic state.

“Retrocession wouldn’t give the Democrats their real aim: two Democratic senators in perpetuity to rubber-stamp the swamp’s agenda, so you won’t hear them talk about it,” Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, said on Thursday in a lengthy diatribe on the floor.

He declared that Wyoming, a state with a smaller population, was a “well-rounded, working-class state” superior to Washington, which would amount to “an appendage of the federal government” full of lobbyists and civil servants. Wyoming is more than 80 percent white, while the majority of the District of Columbia is composed of people of color.

The arguments against statehood on the House floor barely shifted since the full chamber last debated the merits of granting statehood to Washington more than a quarter of a century ago. Opponents questioned the constitutional merits, arguing that the founding fathers intentionally did not establish the nation’s capital as a state. Others questioned whether the District of Columbia was geographically and economically viable to be a state.

“Our nation’s founders made it clear that D.C. is not meant to be a state,” said Representative Jody B. Hice, Republican of Georgia. “They thought about it, they debated it, and they rejected it.”

Representative Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota was the sole Democrat to join Republicans in opposing the measure on Friday.

Top Democrats, several wearing masks with a symbol of the statehood movement, took to the floor to argue passionately for its passage, denouncing the disenfranchisement of Washington residents. Applause broke out on the floor as soon as the bill reached the necessary 218 threshold to pass.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi, at her weekly news conference in the Capitol, dismissed as shortsighted the Republican arguments that the new state would simply give Democrats a political advantage. Alaska and Hawaii, she pointed out, had entered the union as overwhelmingly Democratic and Republican states and then flipped politically.

“What the state is, that can change over time,” Ms. Pelosi said. “But the fact is, people in the District of Columbia pay taxes, fight wars, risk their lives for our democracy — and yet in this place, they have no vote in the House and Senate.”

The District of Columbia, where license plates read “Taxation without representation,” has long been burdened by a lack of federal representation.

The capital first earned three electoral votes and the right to vote for president in 1961 with the passage of the 23rd Amendment. The right to elect a nonvoting delegate came a decade later, but lawmakers could not agree on whether to give that delegate the right to vote, and the statehood legislation never survived a floor vote.

The disparity has gained renewed national attention during the coronavirus pandemic and the protests over racial injustice. In the $2.2 trillion stimulus law enacted in March, the District of Columbia received a small fraction of the funds doled out to states to help dull the economic effect of the virus because it was treated as a territory, despite customarily being granted funding as if it were a state.

And when the administration flooded the streets of Washington with National Guard forces from elsewhere and troops in riot gear during protests over the death of George Floyd in police custody, Ms. Bowser had few options this month because of how much control Congress maintains over the District of Columbia’s finances and laws.

“Denying D.C. statehood to over 700,000 residents, the majority of them black and brown, is systemic racism,” said Stasha Rhodes, campaign director of the pro-statehood group 51 for 51. “D.C. statehood is one of the most urgent civil rights and racial justice issues of our time — and we know we are on the right side of history.”

Ms. Bowser, a fifth-generation Washingtonian, told reporters at a news conference on Thursday that she was “born here without a vote, but I swear I will not die here without a vote.”

The House vote, she said, would lay the groundwork for another administration to make statehood law. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has said he would support the move.

"Russia Secretly Offered Afghan Militants Bounties to Kill U.S. Troops, Intelligence Says","WASHINGTON — American intelligence officials have concluded that a Russian military intelligence unit secretly offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants for killing coalition forces in Afghanistan — including targeting American troops — amid the peace talks to end the long-running war there, according to officials briefed on the matter.

The United States concluded months ago that the Russian unit, which has been linked to assassination attempts and other covert operations in Europe intended to destabilize the West or take revenge on turncoats, had covertly offered rewards for successful attacks last year.

Islamist militants, or armed criminal elements closely associated with them, are believed to have collected some bounty money, the officials said. Twenty Americans were killed in combat in Afghanistan in 2019, but it was not clear which killings were under suspicion.

The intelligence finding was briefed to President Trump, and the White House’s National Security Council discussed the problem at an interagency meeting in late March, the officials said. Officials developed a menu of potential options — starting with making a diplomatic complaint to Moscow and a demand that it stop, along with an escalating series of sanctions and other possible responses, but the White House has yet to authorize any step, the officials said.

An operation to incentivize the killing of American and other NATO troops would be a significant and provocative escalation of what American and Afghan officials have said is Russian support for the Taliban, and it would be the first time the Russian spy unit was known to have orchestrated attacks on Western troops.

Any involvement with the Taliban that resulted in the deaths of American troops would also be a huge escalation of Russia’s so-called hybrid war against the United States, a strategy of destabilizing adversaries through a combination of such tactics as cyberattacks, the spread of fake news and covert and deniable military operations.

The Kremlin had not been made aware of the accusations, said Dmitry Peskov, the press secretary for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. “If someone makes them, we’ll respond,” Mr. Peskov said.

Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, denied that the insurgents have “any such relations with any intelligence agency” and called the report an attempt to defame them.

“These kinds of deals with the Russian intelligence agency are baseless — our target killings and assassinations were ongoing in years before, and we did it on our own resources,” he said. “That changed after our deal with the Americans, and their lives are secure and we don’t attack them.”

Spokespeople at the National Security Council, the Pentagon, the State Department and the C.I.A. declined to comment.

The officials familiar with the intelligence did not explain the White House delay in deciding how to respond to the intelligence about Russia.

While some of his closest advisers, like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have counseled more hawkish policies toward Russia, Mr. Trump has adopted an accommodating stance toward Moscow.

At a summit in 2018 in Helsinki, Finland, Mr. Trump strongly suggested that he believed Mr. Putin’s denial that the Kremlin interfered in the 2016 presidential election, despite broad agreement within the American intelligence establishment that it did. Mr. Trump criticized a bill imposing sanctions on Russia when he signed it into law after Congress passed it by veto-proof majorities. And he has repeatedly made statements that undermined the NATO alliance as a bulwark against Russian aggression in Europe.

The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the delicate intelligence and internal deliberations. They said the intelligence had been treated as a closely held secret, but the administration expanded briefings about it this week — including sharing information about it with the British government, whose forces are among those said to have been targeted.

The intelligence assessment is said to be based at least in part on interrogations of captured Afghan militants and criminals. The officials did not describe the mechanics of the Russian operation, such as how targets were picked or how money changed hands. It is also not clear whether Russian operatives had deployed inside Afghanistan or met with their Taliban counterparts elsewhere.

The revelations came into focus inside the Trump administration at a delicate and distracted time. Although officials collected the intelligence earlier in the year, the interagency meeting at the White House took place as the coronavirus pandemic was becoming a crisis and parts of the country were shutting down.

Moreover, as Mr. Trump seeks re-election in November, he wants to strike a peace deal with the Taliban to end the Afghanistan war.

Both American and Afghan officials have previously accused Russia of providing small arms and other support to the Taliban that amounts to destabilizing activity, although Russian government officials have dismissed such claims as “idle gossip” and baseless.

“We share some interests with Russia in Afghanistan, and clearly they’re acting to undermine our interests as well,” Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., the commander of American forces in Afghanistan at the time, said in a 2018 interview with the BBC.

Though coalition troops suffered a spate of combat casualties last summer and early fall, only a few have since been killed. Four Americans were killed in combat in early 2020, but the Taliban have not attacked American positions since a February agreement.

American troops have also sharply reduced their movement outside military bases because of the coronavirus, reducing their exposure to attack.

While officials were said to be confident about the intelligence that Russian operatives offered and paid bounties to Afghan militants for killing Americans, they have greater uncertainty about how high in the Russian government the covert operation was authorized and what its aim may be.

Some officials have theorized that the Russians may be seeking revenge on NATO forces for a 2018 battle in Syria in which the American military killed several hundred pro-Syrian forces, including numerous Russian mercenaries, as they advanced on an American outpost. Officials have also suggested that the Russians may have been trying to derail peace talks to keep the United States bogged down in Afghanistan. But the motivation remains murky.

The officials briefed on the matter said the government had assessed the operation to be the handiwork of Unit 29155, an arm of Russia’s military intelligence agency, known widely as the G.R.U. The unit is linked to the March 2018 nerve agent poisoning in Salisbury, England, of Sergei Skripal, a former G.R.U. officer who had worked for British intelligence and then defected, and his daughter.

Western intelligence officials say the unit, which has operated for more than a decade, has been charged by the Kremlin with carrying out a campaign to destabilize the West through subversion, sabotage and assassination. In addition to the 2018 poisoning, the unit was behind an attempted coup in Montenegro in 2016 and the poisoning of an arms manufacturer in Bulgaria a year earlier.

American intelligence officials say the G.R.U. was at the center of Moscow’s covert efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. In the months before that election, American officials say, two G.R.U. cyberunits, known as 26165 and 74455, hacked into Democratic Party servers and then used WikiLeaks to publish embarrassing internal communications.

In part because those efforts were aimed at helping tilt the election in Mr. Trump’s favor, his handling of issues related to Russia and Mr. Putin has come under particular scrutiny. The special counsel investigation found that the Trump campaign welcomed Russia’s intervention and expected to benefit from it, but found insufficient evidence to establish that his associates had engaged in any criminal conspiracy with Moscow.

Operations involving Unit 29155 tend to be much more violent than those involving the cyberunits. Its officers are often decorated military veterans with years of service, in some cases dating to the Soviet Union’s failed war in Afghanistan in the 1980s. Never before has the unit been accused of orchestrating attacks on Western soldiers, but officials briefed on its operations say it has been active in Afghanistan for many years.

Though Russia declared the Taliban a terrorist organization in 2003, relations between them have been warming in recent years. Taliban officials have traveled to Moscow for peace talks with other prominent Afghans, including the former president, Hamid Karzai. The talks have excluded representatives from the current Afghan government as well as anyone from the United States, and at times they have seemed to work at crosscurrents with American efforts to bring an end to the conflict.

The disclosure comes at a time when Mr. Trump has said he would invite Mr. Putin to an expanded meeting of the Group of 7 nations, but tensions between American and Russian militaries are running high.

In several recent episodes, in international territory and airspace from off the coast of Alaska to the Black and Mediterranean Seas, combat planes from each country have scrambled to intercept military aircraft from the other.

Many Students Will Be in Classrooms Only Part of the Week This Fall,"As school districts across the country began to reveal reopening plans this week, parents and students were forced to grapple with a difficult reality: It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue.

Students in Seattle are likely to go to school in person only once or twice a week, officials said. Half of Omaha’s students will attend Monday and Tuesday, and the other half Thursday and Friday, rotating Wednesdays. And Fairfax County, Va., outside Washington, said students would spend at least two days a week in class, with the rest online. 

The governors of Connecticut and New Jersey announced guidance that they said would allow students to return to school, but left the details up to districts, with Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey acknowledging on Friday that some schools would likely need to adopt a hybrid model and restrict daily attendance.

Many of the nation’s largest districts have yet to announce plans, although Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York suggested on Friday that all of the city’s 1.1 million students are unlikely to return full-time during the pandemic. “One day there’s going to be a vaccine,” he said, “and I think that’s the day when you’re going to see things go back 100 percent — to every kid in the classroom — as normal.”

Reopening decisions are likely to vary greatly based on the size and density of districts, as well as region. In the South and West, where political leaders have been more eager to reopen their economies despite a recent upswing in coronavirus cases, school systems may be more likely to return to a full-time schedule, albeit with distance restrictions, new sanitation procedures and mask recommendations. 

But for districts that hope to closely follow guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it would be nearly impossible to maintain sanitation and social distancing with normal school attendance. Class sizes in many schools would need to be cut by more than half. And while health experts generally recommend face coverings for both staff and students, some educators and parents say that is not realistic, especially for the youngest children.

Those complications are likely to prompt many districts — where administrators must decide how to implement the broad guidelines from federal and state health officials — to adopt a hybrid model in which students will spend some time in the classroom but a significant portion of the week at home.

Although that reality has been apparent to many educators for weeks, it is just beginning to confront parents. Some are finding out this week that their scramble to balance their own jobs with their children’s education and daily care will continue for many months, if not all of next school year.

“Everyone, including myself, wants to go back every day,” said Naomi Peña, a mother of three New York City public school students. “I’ve come to terms with the fact that that’s wishful thinking.”

Ms. Peña is hopeful that her children will be able to report to school every other day for the fall semester. “These kids need some sense of normalcy back,” she said, adding, “Every single parent I know, their whole routine they have cherished and worked so hard to preserve is completely out the window, and in the trash can.”

The enormous strain caused by remote learning and limited child-care options has been particularly hard on working mothers, said Julie Kashen, the director for women’s economic justice at the Century Foundation, a public policy research group. “We’ve worked so hard to have choices for women in the work force, and it doesn’t feel like we have real choices right now,” she said.

Experts on working families are concerned that employers who were flexible in the spring may lose their patience come fall, even if schools do not fully reopen. “Families have used up any slack we’ve created in the system,” said Brigid Schulte, who runs the Better Life Lab at New America, a think tank.

Most parents, teachers and school leaders acknowledge that remote learning did not work as well as it should have during the spring semester, and that it will need to improve rapidly for the coming year. The average American student is expected to return to school significantly behind academically, with low-income, black and Hispanic students experiencing the greatest learning losses.

Many schools are providing professional development to teachers this summer and also reconsidering how they use technology. Still, no matter how much online learning improves, keeping school buildings shuttered will have a profound impact on children, especially the most vulnerable.

Those students have endured economic strife, parental unemployment and the burden of caring for younger siblings while being isolated from their own friends. In cities like New York, some are struggling with the trauma of seeing their family members, teachers and principals die of the virus. Schools offer a support system that is impossible to replicate online.

As they make reopening plans, many districts are taking into account the special needs of some students. In Seattle, where the schools announced this week that their goal was to provide at least two days per week of in-person instruction to elementary students and one day to middle and high school students, officials said children with disabilities, those learning English and those living in poverty would be given priority for additional in-school support.

Educators crafting reopening plans face a daunting set of challenges this summer, from how to procure enough masks and cleaning supplies, to how to reduce class sizes and redesign lesson plans to adhere to social distancing guidelines.

The latest on how the pandemic is reshaping education.

Instead of clustering around tables for group projects, teenagers will likely receive more individual assignments, with the students seated at desks facing forward. Younger children won’t be able to pile onto a soft rug for story time; instead, they will be required to sit in clearly marked spaces, six feet apart.

Many districts are surveying parents to better understand their comfort level with reopening school buildings. They are finding a significant minority — up to a third of parents in some large districts — do not want to send their children into classrooms, according to Mike Magee, chief executive of Chiefs for Change, a coalition of district and state education leaders.

Most districts are expected to give parents the option of keeping their children home. Schools in Nashville and Marietta, Ga., said this week that families would be given a choice between in-person schooling and full-time online instruction.

But the hybrid approach, with only limited classroom time, could become the norm in states that have experienced heavy coronavirus caseloads and have chosen to take a slower approach to reopening the economy. Those states, mostly controlled by Democrats, also tend to have powerful teachers’ unions, which have repeatedly raised a red flag about the health risks of reopening schools — even as they have pushed for limitations on the expectations placed on teachers working from home.

The American Federation of Teachers, a national union, has estimated that in order to safely and effectively reopen, the nation’s schools will need an additional $116 billion to cover costs such as reducing class sizes, increasing cleaning staff, and hiring counselors and educators to help students recover from the emotional and academic impact of the pandemic.

Despite the challenges, some education and health experts have called for fully reopening schools before the development of a Covid-19 vaccine, given the central role that American schools play in both the lives of children and the ability of parents to work outside the home.

The experts point to hopeful evidence from child care centers that have remained open to serve the children of essential workers: Widespread outbreaks of the virus there appear to have been rare or even nonexistent. Research suggests that children are much less likely than adults to die from the virus or to suffer a severe health consequence; children may also be less likely than adults to transmit the illness.

But the science on the virus has shifted rapidly in recent months, and much is still unknown. In addition, the pandemic has become politicized in many parts of the country, leaving school leaders wondering whether they can effectively enforce mask wearing and other risk-mitigating behaviors among students and staff.

That is just one of many concerns for Scott Muri, the superintendent of the Ector County schools in Odessa, Texas. His days are filled with considerations of both logistics and teaching strategies.

For students to return to school, he will have to reduce the number of children on buses at any given time. He is also weighing whether to reassign teachers so that only the most skilled at online instruction are creating video lessons, while others are focused more on small-group tutoring and counseling, which could be provided either online or in person.

Dr. Muri has yet to announce a reopening plan, but expects a hybrid model.

“I will not welcome back any child or staff member if I do not feel it’s the safest environment we could possibly create,” he said. “Until we get past the dangerous period, right now, everything is on the table for consideration.”
