# Fake News Generator

For this project, we wanted to see how easy it would be to generate convincing fake news by training GPT-2 models. We trained these models using articles from The New York Times on the topics of Black Lives Matter, COVID-19, and the 2020 U.S. election. You can find our trained models [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13xBv1TngYsshuoaZ2vwv1VmCwclc46zx?usp=sharing). This repository also provides a user interface for generating more articles.

## Download Pre-Requisites

In the root folder, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
We use Python version 3.7.x to run this project.

## Run User Interface for Pre-Generated Samples

To generate random samples that we already created, go into fast-ui and run:
```
python -m http.server
```

## Run User Interface for Generating New Samples

If you would like to generate articles in every topic, you can download all_models.zip. Downloading all_models.zip can a long time, so if you would only like to explore one topic, you can download one of blm_models.zip, covid_models.zip, or election_models.zip. All of these zip files are can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13xBv1TngYsshuoaZ2vwv1VmCwclc46zx?usp=sharing)). Once you have downloaded one of these zip files, decompress the zip, rename the folder to "models", and place the folder under src. In src, run:
```
export FLASK_APP=generate_sample.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
Finally, navigate to http://localhost:5000/test to interact with the user interface.
