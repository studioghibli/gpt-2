A trucker shot and killed a white police officer while police were investigating protests in Dallas.

A Texas State Highway Patrol trooper was killed and three others were injured at a gas station in the city of Hennepin County, according to authorities.

Thousands gathered at a protest rally in Houston, Texas

The man, identified only by the police as Derek Johnson, was driving drunk in downtown Houston when he got into a disagreement with authorities, authorities said. The man then pulled out a gun and fired. The driver fled after an investigation, police said, and the two victims died at a hospital. Both men later died of shock.

Trump administration has taken steps to bolster police departments

article:
On March 23, a new bill became law in the House, calling for the creation of an emergency room and mental health unit for law enforcement officers. The administration has also been able to deploy its security forces to state and local police departments around the country. In Los Angeles County, officials took advantage of the fact that police departments have historically provided only a small percentage of the public with support to keep their law enforcement divisions safe during political campaigns. In Texas, an estimated 40 percent of police officers work under the state or local law enforcement umbrella and more than double the nationwide average. Some departments have even become home to law enforcement agencies that do not have the same level of security, like the police department at the University of Texas at Austin. In New York, however, police unions in three cities, including Stuyvesant, are under pressure to keep police in place, or to lay off employees. In Washington, the police union in Manhattan said at a news conference on March 1 that the city had received 20 requests for a contract to serve as the police union's headquarters. Last month, the union issued an announcement that included a pledge that the Police Department would become a national organization that would hold the mayor's chair position, an effort initially opposed by several of the cities already in charge of the police.

In the past three days alone, at least five officers have been killed in encounters with armed civilians outside the George Washington Bridge during protests across the nation, according to federal data. In New Jersey, two officers were seriously injured after a series of protests demanding justice for the unarmed black men killed in the killing of George Floyd in 2009. In Atlanta, one officer was killed and two police employees were wounded when a man with a knife attempted to enter an apartment block in a predominantly black neighborhood.

The unrest over the death of George Floyd, who was found dead, galvanized the nation in the weeks immediately following his death and became the catalyst for the national movement for civil rights that drew Americans together to demand justice for African Americans. But the killing of Mr. Floyd and the protests surrounding him raised more questions than answers.

It was not immediately clear who, or what, was involved in the killing of Mr. Floyd, in spite of calls from some black officials that the killing was the work of white people. But the movement became a powerful symbol of the struggles to bring justice for Black Americans who have been disenfranchised in a culture of oppression. The police and national governments have been silent. The president, after he was arrested on several charges with three other black officers, declared a state of emergency in three states as protests over Mr. Floyd intensified; there was no immediate statement from Mr. Trump.

The latest in a series of high-profile firings of Black employees and activists by the Trump White House

article:
Mr. Trump has dismissed his critics — notably his former National Security Adviser Michael T. Flynn — as traitors to his presidency. On Thursday, he fired Mr. Flynn, who had worked with Mr. Trump on national security matters, after he refused to give Mr. Trump a security clearance. And in some cases, the firings, which could land him in prison, threaten to tear down his presidency.

As protests have spread around the nation against the police killings and racism that have plagued American cities and towns in recent days, so, too, has the unrest over Mr. Trump.

On Monday, the mayor of Los Angeles, Angel Arruda, resigned after an investigation revealed that he had sought to take over from John A. McGraw, the mayor of Los Angeles, who was tapped as the city's new police chief and chief of police for the first time after Mr. Trump's firing.

Mr. McGraw, 61, spent nearly a year as Trump campaign manager before assuming the job of police chief in May. Within two weeks, Mr. Trump fired Mr. McGraw, who had served as a campaign adviser during the 2016 campaign. The same month, in a speech to a rally in Philadelphia, Mr. Trump said that he wanted to be able to work with the city to bring about change.

One of Mr. McGraw's closest aides, Robert Kelner, was fired last week after a complaint that a police officer had defroated his desk and touched Mr. Trump. A federal grand jury had subpoenaed Mr. Kelner, a veteran federal investigator, to testify in the case.

The New York Times Opens Pandora's Box With Its Op-Ed … That Transforms Racism

article:
While our country still faces great racial tensions, the Times opened its new edition with its new headline, "The New York Times: Racial Violence in the United States Is Not a Civil War. It Is A War On Trump, a War Against Black People, A War Over Trump City, and a War On Black Lives." The Times, in its new edition, emphasized many of our nation's racist pasts, including the legacy of slavery.

The Times — unlike any other newspaper in the country — is not the only major news organization to do so — and, unlike the Times, it is a new nonprofit.

The most recent edition, which was a public relations stunt that took place just once in 2016, focused on the ongoing violence in the wake of the murder of Eric Garner, a black man who died in April of 2014. The Times was also criticized by the NAACP, which argued that it did not represent blacks.

The Times opened its latest edition at 7:20 a.m. on Friday, Dec. 27, on a news show broadcast by The Times Network. It was broadcast live on the air for a week.

During that same hour, on the night of Dec. 27, the Times aired a video on the program, titled, "What We Think We Know About Hate: A Matter of Police Brutality," where Michael Floyd, Robert Byrd Jr., George Floyd, George Floyd, Nellie Anthony Williams and the Rev. Rodney King were the featured speakers.

The video — called, perhaps wrongly, Racialized Terror: Black Women in America and Others in Racialized Terrorism

And finally, on Jan. 6, the Times unveiled its latest edition. The new edition was live on its radio program at 7:30 p.m.

The newspaper has taken steps to make the new edition more progressive.

From the Times' office at George Mason University and its offices on the grounds during the national anthem, it created a new section dedicated to addressing issues of racism at its university. It also created several other new projects, including a new section dedicated to addressing issues of discrimination on college campuses.

The New York Times is launching an investigation into allegations that it promoted white nationalist views as fact

article:
Here are the main points.

1.

The Times is under fire for promoting a far-right video called, in part, an ad commissioned by a company that distributes racist and sexist messages on its site as well as on social media.

At about 20 minutes — more than it normally has for a daily New York Times column — the ad appears to claim to show a video about American history being depicted as racist — a charge that, according to the Times, was quickly dropped. It has since gone viral and been widely read.

2.

The Times is under fire for airing footage in which the leader of the Black Panthers, who used the name Martin Luther King Jr., calls for police brutality.

The ad is widely viewed as evidence of bias in the way the Times is run, a charge it denies.

3.

“Our reporters are not only being fired, their jobs are being terminated,’ it is claimed, blaming news organizations for not being transparent or providing an accurate analysis of the work done on the piece. “These [transcripts] were written in order not to look like news and to get away from the issue’s bigger picture,” the company wrote in a letter to employees on Tuesday.

4.

The Times has been accused of lying in other pieces of news reporting.

It is also accused of distancing itself from a series of articles on racial justice in a recent piece by Thomas Glynn — that was published two weeks ago. The former reporter was also accused of defaming fellow journalist Jonathan Capehart, whom the Times had accused of reporting on protests.

The Times says it is “actively’ investigating all relevant allegations related to my coverage of the protests in Minneapolis,” which was recently called out by the Times in a report issued early this month on its handling of the protests.

The Times has a history of criticizing journalists and also of failing to keep up with their own work. The news organization in 2011 fired its director after the Times reported on its racism and sexism.

The Times is also at fault for failing to publish a video of a white supremacist, whose voice was recorded by a news reporter.

5.

The Times apologized to the public.

The Times reported Wednesday on the use of a live-stream video posted to YouTube by the Black Lives Matter movement that was used as part of an investigation into the violent video calling for the assassination of President-elect Donald Trump.

“We had the wrong decision in going to the wrong place at the wrong time,” Thomas Frank, managing editor of The New York Times. “In fact we have more trouble communicating with them about the right decision than they do at telling them about our mistakes.”

The video was removed by an anonymous author on Monday after the Times criticized it. The author of the video, Michael Barbaro, tweeted that the Times had not given its authors credit, describing it as “a political statement being pushed by [an] extremist “anarchist” group in which the author was referring to Black Lives Matter as “tortured” or “radical leftist”” — in reference to “allowing [a] black person to murder white people’s black relatives.”

The Times is now under fire for appearing in a video that was edited out of the video itself. The video was set to be aired by an online news channel on Tuesday — and was edited out of the Times' video.

The latest in a series of protests against police brutality is set to draw a record crowd.

article:
On Friday, a demonstration will take place in Denver. The Denver Police Department is asking drivers to slow down to avoid an intersection in the city's West Side neighborhood and to take control over their vehicles as protesters in Portland, Ore., demonstrate against the police.

Activists who live near the protest site reported seeing several armed police officers from across the country.

The protests began in Houston on Thursday to protest police brutality, but by Saturday night they were more violent.

In the same neighborhood where Saturday night was the start of the first of three demonstrations in the area, people gathered in a row of tents for hours to vent and express anger about police brutality. At 10 p.m. local time on Saturday, people could be seen clapping and holding signs that said, "Police brutality."

Police across the country are calling on their citizens to walk away from the protests in protest of police racism. Activists say they are protesting against the injustice inflicted upon blacks and other minorities. Some Americans don't believe demonstrators have done enough for racism against whites.

Police in cities around the country are trying to bring people who have been protesting against police racism to the intersection before it has even begun.

In Seattle, a crowd who had been holding signs with the word BLACK OUTED was brought out of a tent on Saturday afternoon by one of those officers to protest black lives and the lack of policing in communities of color. The police responded, but their presence did little to calm the crowd as the protesters made their way peacefully from the site of a police station to other housing projects.

On Saturday, officers from the Department of Homeland Security arrived at the site, using pepper spray and tear gas, and they arrested several demonstrators in the area. A second protester was arrested in another protest site. The department said the third protester had been arrested on suspicion of possession of an unregistered substance. But it is unclear how many people were outside the site of what authorities said were other arrests.

There were more than 100 protesters gathered on Sunday night, including about 20 kids. The protest site is now crowded with the crowd. Many people started to stand up and shout at authorities to calm down peacefully, but police continued to use excessive force during the night.

The protest ended peacefully, but an unprovoked tear gas canister from a police officer was seen throwing a canister of tear gas into the crowd. Several people were injured.

Demonstrators who left the site said that the officers told them to stay out of the area but that they had a constitutional right to protest. Some members of the protest team told the police that they were trying to stay away from the protests. But the officers said they were not aware that the protesters had peacefully gone into the protest site. Those officers then chased or threatened the protesters and threw them down.

In Houston, the police tried to detain two people in a parking lot of a homeless encampment. A few people took refuge on the streets of Houston. They kept their hands bound behind their backs and refused to go away until officers who were with them came and asked them to get up and start marching toward them. The officers then pulled a stun gun on them.

When they arrived at the site, a handful of people tried to march with them but were stopped for a moment. The officers who were with them pulled the stun gun out and started to move away. Police officers continued to pursue and try and get people out of the scene.

About 20 people were arrested during the night, including two teenagers and one adult. Police said two people had been arrested. The ages of the students, who were students at George Washington University, were not immediately known, The Post has reported.

Rockefeller Center Shooting Is Not a Reason to Dismantle Police

article:
No one at the White House has called it a matter of national importance. But when people are trying to justify their own culpability by criticizing a police killing, the idea often strikes new, disturbing ways into the American psyche that police institutions are at the very core of society. We all have different feelings on the matter. The police do not exist to protect us from our fellow citizens, their rights, our rights to self-defense and the protection of the American Constitution. They are an institution of great concern for the American people. In my view, people can have different views, and the White House should be trying to have a more nuanced conversation about the question of how it is that the public is trying to protect itself from being threatened by police officers.

The president and his top aides were furious over the video, and had repeatedly called for the federal government to take action to protect the citizens of New York. President Bush has said that the federal government should do so. But after a series of videos circulated by the liberal and far right, including one featuring New York City police officers fatally shooting protesters, protesters began to publicly protest the president and the police, with many calling the president himself a racist.

One person from Trump campaign adviser Kellyanne Conway expressed shock at the outcry against the police, including the president himself, as well as the video, saying he had been told he was a target of a racially motivated riot.

The president, who has never been accused of racism, has been criticized for saying he would not pardon George Floyd “’s son from the previous presidency and that he did not want to be a part of “a systemic racism that would make me look bad for my kids.” His son, Floyd, was a college football star in the 1950s who was a student-athlete in the 1960s, and while he was a high school senior, Floyd was arrested and tried for the murder of an African-American woman in 1963. Floyd’s family sued the United States in 1980, but that case was thrown out.

In interviews with The New York Times and Washington Post, those calling for a federal investigation of the George Floyd killing said it should have been left to a police department to decide whether to hold him at gunpoint, given that the police already used excessive force without a warrant in the case, and would have been better off with less intervention — but then said there was much more work to be done.

Those remarks came as the president and his aides were trying to figure out the details of what happened on Wednesday. But one of their top officials said the White House would be seeking a more detailed account of what took place at Trump Tower, in the shadow of the White House compound, and could include the names of people who had interacted with the president to get a sense of what was going on.

Michael McFaul, the White House spokesman, expressed frustration on Monday that the White House would be using a photograph of the president and the Police Department to blame his death.

“They use the photo, because in America, it’s supposed to be the public,” McFaul said on CNN. “We use it in our daily briefing. But as the president himself said, that is not how it works.

“The fact that someone is going to go there and say ‘Oh no, they shot a video of a protest,” McFaul said. “And the fact that we’ll be on camera doing all of the same things that a protester would have done, which is,” he added.

After the video of the shooting was shown to protesters, McFaul said he felt the video was showing the wrong side of the president and the police.

“That was not a reason to punish the president directly. That’s a fact.”

In March, a group of Somali-Americans gathered outside the White House to protest police killings of unarmed black men

article:
While the president did not mention the protests by name, some activists said in a statement that the crowds in question were peaceful and that they were demonstrating against the militarized police in Minneapolis, with a large number of African-Americans. Some supporters denounced the president for using the words “radical Islam” to describe the movement.

For the past year, the president has called for an end to the use by police in Minneapolis of tear gas rounds, tear gas cans, stun guns and other weapons to disperse crowds, and in his recent call for a moratorium on the use of firebombs on police officers.

Some protesters have accused the president of pandering to racial anxiety, or pandering to the frustrations and fears of African-American Americans.

In recent months, a group of protesters at a recent memorial honoring Trayvon Martin has been confronted by police officials in Minneapolis and other cities. In Los Angeles, the scene quickly got out of hand, with a car blocking the driver on a sidewalk with its hood sagged off, causing a standoff involving officers.

In New York, protesters were confronted by the police after chanting in Brooklyn that “black lives matter,” and “black lives matter too.” At the intersection of Broadway and Central Highways, the officers chased and tackled the group. One of the officers, Nicholas C. Johnson, told the crowd after the encounter with the group that “he was not ready to go in,” The incident at Central Highways prompted city officials to ban street lamps and ban the use of force on demonstrators.

In Minnesota, a Minneapolis police officer was pulled over by protesters on Saturday after he was seen repeatedly firing a flashbang into the air, killing one bystander and injuring another bystander. The officer has now been placed on administrative leave.

“The officer’s actions in Minneapolis are in violation of the law,” Mayor Thomas Johnson of Minneapolis said in a statement. “This officer has violated his duty to protect the public, and the public’s right to peacefully assemble.”

At least a dozen officers, including Minneapolis Police Department spokesman Sgt. Brian Bowers, who has held some posts at the department, have been fired after being caught in a police chokehold.

According to federal and local police records, Mr. Johnson was accused of failing to yield to a police officer during a verbal confrontation in which he was filmed hitting him several times, hitting his wrist, knee and neck.

A few hours after the incident, during a traffic stop, the officer told the police that he fired the flashbang at him and that the suspect did not have a weapon. The officer then took out a stun gun that he had put on his hip and a gun and fired two shots. At least two officers fired the stun guns at the suspect for the second time in eight minutes, Mr. Johnson said.

In another episode, Mr. Johnson told a Minneapolis detective in April that he had an outstanding warrant and was looking to use it against the suspect, whom investigators named “one of those “a”s from my neighborhood in Minneapolis who was in the wrong with his life and his family.” The detective, George P. Martin Jr., testified in court that Mr. Johnson claimed that the suspect did not have a firearm and that his family “were’t being mistreated by the police.”

The officers who were involved in the encounter were fired. The Minneapolis Police Department is still investigating.

The Minneapolis Police Department has made no comment on the video.

In a statement, Chief W.H. Palmer said he had received an email on December 12 from the officer who fired Mr. Johnson: “The video of “a flashbang being thrown at a Minneapolis cop has been removed.”

Texas Demands Removal of Confederate Monument From Public Space

article:
“I wanted to see a statue of the Confederacy, but that's not part of the history of the history of this country. We shouldn’t honor this history. We shouldn’t honor this history with an epithet like that.”

The mayor of Fort Worth, Greg Abbott, said in a statement Monday that “we need to know this history. The statue isn’t something we should celebrate in the South. There are many different ways to honor our heritage.” But as the president of the National Museum of African-American History and Culture said Monday when a Confederate flag was flown at the Museum of African-American History and Culture’s Capitol Hill offices, the museum is wrong.

“The museum should never have painted that flag on the Capitol Hill building grounds,” Mr. Abbott said. “It made sense, but that’s not how it should be,” he added. “Our history is about what we call a legacy —”

Mr. Abbott said that the Confederate flag was “a symbol of our slavery under a president who would have banned it,” adding that even then, the statues in his city, especially those in his own city, “had to be removed because they should never have been there.”

The flag used by Confederate troops during the civil war has been used as a symbol of racism for generations, and it will soon be the symbol of a major national reckoning at a time when some of the country’s most prominent black leaders are struggling to understand the significance of the symbol and its significance to their communities.

Many in the Confederate movement are also fighting at the state and national level for broader support for the group, which has been fighting to bring the word into the world outside the official ban. Confederate troops were known to wear head coverings on their uniforms in the Confederate states of North Carolina and South Carolina.

At a recent state and national gathering hosted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, Confederate officials said that Confederate heritage should be represented in the country’s first state statute. That law would require monuments, such as the one commemorating Robert E. Lee, to commemorate the Confederacy, while acknowledging the nation’s heritage, the law states.

A monument commemorating the battle for independence in the South, a symbol of the Confederacy, was unveiled early Tuesday morning by the Confederacy’ headquarters in Alexandria and set into a park at 8 a.m.

“Now that the Confederacy and all of the white men who had the Confederacy’s flag and arms in them, we have a place to honor their struggle, we can all have a voice to tell our stories,” said a woman who was at the gathering. “When we speak, we have to tell the history that they fought for.”

Members of The National Guard had to break up a rally on Capitol Hill that was being attended by many white people.

The University of California at Berkeley is facing mounting criticism for a controversial decision to remove a Confederate battle flag from its building

article:
The university said Thursday it would remove a Confederate flag from its main campus after a group of students and faculty — including two female professors — protested that the display, called a "national disgrace" on campus.

The move angered the university, which hosted a student conference for women on a theme aimed at ending racial discrimination and removing the insignia of the Confederate battle flag. Other students also denounced the decision not to remove the flag.

The university on Monday said the city of Lafayette, La., could rescind its decision to remove the symbols of the United States flag and Confederate ranks, as well as the battle emblem that commemorates Confederate forces.

"The university regrets that its decision to remove the flag is not in line with current trends and culture, based on the findings of our research and recent events, that have led to the incontrovertible fact that the city would be in grave financial distress, resulting in significant state and local and federal support," the university president said in a statement.

But the student activists urged the university to take a more in-depth look at alternatives, saying the university had failed students by not recognizing the historical significance of the flag and how symbols that symbolize racial divisions — such as the battle flag — became synonymous with slavery.

Students have also pointed out that in many cases, flag symbols are considered more appropriate today than the Confederate battle flags as they were in the late 1800s and early 1900s under the banner of protecting racial equality. This was not always the case.

On Tuesday night, students gathered for a public demonstration that began with a protest in the city's Union Square — with hundreds demonstrating against the removal of the Confederate battle flags.

The planned public demonstration was the second largest in the city on Wednesday. The crowd — largely composed of students and activists on behalf of the school — also included many from the city of Oakland and the area around UC Berkeley.

On Wednesday morning, Berkeley Mayor Gavin Newsom announced a plan that would remove the three Confederate symbols associated with the city that were used to symbolize slavery, including a statue of Robert E. Lee.

The University of Colorado System's System Diversity Program is Being Revived

article:
We are grateful to the entire Colorado Department of Education and the Office of Hispanic Affairs for providing funds to the Program to further further education opportunities for the community. This will be the beginning of a long and successful process toward the creation of a truly racially and economically inclusive and equitable college system.

In 2015, the Colorado Board of Education and the Colorado Board of Public Education (CBPSE) created the National Center for the Education of Native Americans in the State of Colorado. Its mandate is to develop an academic and pedagogical environment which recognizes the cultural diversity of the state, and, where appropriate, offers opportunities.

The program is expected to be completed in 2018 and begin offering 2019 degrees as the number of degrees offered increases. A 2018 degree program to ensure that colleges and universities are prepared for the diversity crisis is planned.

In a news conference held in conjunction with the University of Colorado System's annual spring meetings, the Board of Education and the Board of Pupil Education and Scholars are announcing a change to its program standards, which the Board of Pupil Education and Scholars described as being to change the curriculum for the 2020 and 2020-2021 academic year, respectively.

The changes come in the wake of intense pressure from the Colorado Legislature and the White House to overhaul curriculum standards for the 2017-18 academic year and to increase funding for a 2020-2021 curriculum. But the changes must come at a cost, in part, because of a large population of students, who are much more interested in history, law and American history than in the arts.

The change on the 2018 edition of standards came at the end of an annual two-day committee meeting that has been running for nearly four weeks.

Among the changes proposed are the establishment of a national master-in-residence program, which is set for 2019-2021 and that will allow students to pursue graduate studies on their own in the fall. And it is expected that a new degree program will be put in place by 2020-21.

The changes represent a further step toward establishing the program and increasing funding for it.

Representatives from the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning advocacy group, called for the 2020-21 curriculum standards to be revised as a way of determining if it should be taught again or not, and for the 2020-2021 curriculum standard to be developed and adopted as a way of defining and delivering an overall education curriculum.

The changes also require the creation of a new department for higher education that would be led by a former secretary and a former teacher.

In August, the Colorado Capitol announced that an education overhaul was under way, which has led many students to ask: Is this the beginning of a new era?

The new curriculum standards would be the culmination of years of hard-fought political battles between moderate Democrats, who campaigned on ending the War on Drugs through legislation crafted by Gov. Brian Schweitzer, and the progressive, progressive and progressive groups, who have been working on similar legislation in the state, including one designed to curb the use of Tasers. There has been no shortage of debate over the future of the drug epidemic in Colorado.

“No other state has the resources to meet the demands of a rapidly changing demographic of young people and the continuing challenge of curbing drug use and other violent behavior on college campuses and at community college campuses,” said David Keene, director of the Center for Education and Research.

The education curriculum standards are aimed at reducing the number and level of students at institutions that are not required to hold bachelor´s degrees. They are intended to be part of a broad effort to reduce the use of legal marijuana and other prohibited drugs in schools.

A former White House intern and activist is facing felony charges after she posted a racist message on social media

article:
White House spokesman Brian Fallon said in an interview on Wednesday that the President is unaware of the post, which was sent to a Twitter account called 'Black Lives Matter.' [New York Times, 9/29/15; Daily Beast, 10/16/16]

Vice President Joe Biden’s wife said Monday that President Trump “wanted to make sure that people understood that racism is not only an individual act, but an ongoing problem.” “That was absolutely not our intention,” she said. “And yet we made the call on Sunday because he made some changes on Sunday, that they should be more detailed. It’s not a black man, it’s a white woman, it’s a white man, and we made that call on Sunday. So what was we supposed to do about that?”

The remarks came the same day that President Trump said to Twitter followers, “When is the last time you saw black people and women walk down the street wearing this “Make America Great Again’” mask?” He added that the President “gave us a lot of time to be focused on it, “but there’s a better way.”

Black women and young people across the country are being asked to stand up for their bodies in protests and to stand for civil rights, including in the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in April, when more than 3,000 people died in violence after police officers in riot gear opened fire on peaceful protesters.

Mr. Trump’s comments came amid a growing wave of support from protesters who say that the police are using excessive force against them as white lives have been taken away from a black man and women.

[The White House]’s stance and stance is inconsistent with the way we treat other people — that racism, sexism, homophobia and some other types of oppression are unacceptable under the law. And I think it’s not the way you treat other people that you should be proud of. In a very real sense, I think, he’s done a great job and a great service on behalf of all people of color who’re facing systemic inequality. And I think that’s a different way of looking at things. But I think that what Donald Trump was saying was accurate.”

Mr. Biden also said on Fox News Wednesday that Mr. Trump’s tweet about the death of Michael Brown “was not a criticism of racism.” “But for people to be saying things that they don’t quite understand, I’m not a racist person,” he said.

The vice president said that Mr. Trump “has not been perfect — and in fact, he’s quite good at it — but he has done a number of things that are different. So I think he’s trying to say an important thing.”

A group of about 200 demonstrators held a sit-in outside the White House on Tuesday

article:
Trump has been criticized for using Twitter in the months leading up to the riots for a variety of reasons, including that he has the authority to ban all Muslims entering the United States, which includes blocking their entry by law enforcement. Those concerns have also been expressed by the black community, which has also voiced concerns.


On Tuesday, President Trump tweeted a photo of the photo he taken of himself in blackface, as if he had a deep connection to the Black Lives Matter movement.


The National Guard’s presence on campus during the riot took on an even greater significance as Black Lives Matter, known for its confrontations with police and a sense of protest, came under attack during the protests last week.


On Wednesday, protesters held a sit-in outside the White House, with officers saying during the protest that President Trump “should be marching” and that “it’s very clear we’re marching against the police’s violence,” prompting riot police to move in.


At around 3 p.m., about 50 people gathered in front of the White House where they held signs with the message:’Keep an eye out for our President.” They chanted ‘Unite the South.’”


Protesters have come together for the last month and a half, according to a senior administration official.

But even as the demonstrations have continued in the past, there are signs that these protests are becoming increasingly isolated from the real-time world and their political repercussions are felt, said the administration official.

The White House is not a place to be used for political conversations, he said, but a place for conversations with leaders who have shown they are willing to address serious social and political problems.


“We saw a large number of those in our media group in their capacity as participants —” the official said. “But it’s different seeing those in the media as participants and seeing them as participants.”


Trump’s comments have come as a reaction to the white supremacist group that has set up camp just outside the White House and used the site to rally to his political message.

In a tweet, he said, “Ralliance for white victims! Racism, division and fear! Black lives are being denied! “The only difference is we do not care.”


On Tuesday morning, the White House police chief took to Twitter to condemn “racist, anti-Semitic, and hateful statements” leveled against protesters who were holding a sit-in outside the main Black Lives Matter demonstration in the city. It sparked a wave of fury amid an angry response from the President himself.

In a series of tweets, Trump wrote: “You have never been so sick and tired of being called a terrorist.”
