How Republicans Are Celebrating Biden's Legacy

article:
You can't have Biden without Biden. It's what you can't have in a president.

At a rally in Brooklyn Wednesday night, Biden told attendees he was "just ready to be President" when he was questioned by the audience about his legacy. "I want to be President of the United States, and I'm ready to be President of the United States," Biden said of his own. Biden, one of the most famous and popular presidents in American history, retired in 1992 after serving five terms as Vice President. He announced his retirement in a speech in his hometown of Beaufort, Florida, on Tuesday.

As his wife, Jill Biden, campaigned on Tuesday for a second term, Biden said he has a "long legacy" of serving as president with his family.

Biden spoke of his family and said he'd like to give it a chance.

"I want to say that I am honored to be president of the United States. I think I'm going to be president of the United States for a long time. I want to say that I am honored to be president of the United States for a long time — and I think that when I get it, I'm ready to be President, too — and I'm ready to be President of the United States again," Biden said.

Biden said he has "a long legacy" of working with the Obama administration as a negotiator, leader and counselor to the president.

"I am a partner and not an ambassador for the president. I work with both sides of the aisle to get things done," Biden said. "I worked with the president on a number of issues — he passed a number of executive orders. I worked with the president on a number of issues. I worked with the president on a number of issues. I work with both sides of the aisle to get things done — I'm ready to be President and I'm ready to be the next president. And I'm ready to be that next president of the United States. And I'm ready to be that next president of the United States, too," Biden said.

He said his family "has a long legacy" of serving in the White House.

"I know that people are going to say to me, 'Are you ready to be President?' But I am not ready to be President. I am not ready to be President. I am not ready to be President. And I am not ready to be the next President.

Why Trump and Biden Will Not Visit Russia in the Years to Come

article:
This is a classic quote by Robert A. McFarlane, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Barack Obama.

"You can never know what you can expect as someone who has gone through his presidency and who has seen the power of the people, the greatness of the people, and how they see the world," McFarlane said in an interview last week. "It's not always about how that presidency ends, but how you bring people together and make the world a better place to live."

The two leading Republicans on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said Wednesday that they are not interested in meeting with Trump or Biden on their own.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex., told Politico on Wednesday that he doesn't believe Kushner will be a factor in Trump or Biden's trip to Moscow.

"It's not just going to be a little bit of a trip — it's going to be a big trip — but it's going to be a trip of a different sort," the Texas Republican said. "If anything that changes the course of things, that's what we're going to be going after."

Trump and Biden had scheduled a short-lived visit to Moscow last month that was cut short in response to the Russian government's interference in the 2016 election and the Trump administration's role in orchestrating it.

But Kushner and his team didn't attend the Nov. 19 meeting — or any other in recent years at the White House.

Instead, they held a short-lived meeting in Washington, D.C., with a Kremlin-connected lawyer, the lawyer told the Washington Post on Tuesday.

The meeting in the White House was canceled when the State Department's ethics-observer, who was overseeing the trip and asked not to be identified, received a subpoena from the Department of Justice to investigate Kushner's conduct.

The Justice Department declined to comment at the time, but then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said a request for an interview had been made in advance.

"There was no effort to interfere in the election, and no campaign to interfere in the election," she said.

In a statement, the White House spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said that the White House had "nothing to add to this report."

"In fact, the press release has failed to provide any information to the media," she said. "There are no reports that would indicate that a White House representative did.

Rudy Giuliani Denies He Did Anything Wrong in New ‘Borat’ Movie

article:
‘I’m Not Afraid ‘So Long As You’ Will Keep Running ‘For Our President ‘It’s Your Vote, It’s Your Vote’ and You’ll Never Vote ‘The Last ‘Dynasty’ Movie ‘I’m Not Afraid’ So Long As you’ll Keep Running‘For Our President‘You’ll Never Vote’

This was a fairly typical Trump tweetstorm, which he used to attack his own aides and campaign aides in the media for their efforts to cover up evidence of his election-related crimes. The line of attack included a tweet that seemed meant to mock the way Clinton and Trump were portrayed on television.

Trump’s campaign released a statement today:

Donald J. Trump Jr., Donald Trump Jr.'s attorney, has been fired and will not be representing him in connection with the Russian interference in the 2016 election. As a result of the media's efforts to cover up allegations of wrongdoing, the Trump campaign has resigned and will not be representing Mr. Trump Jr. in connection with the Russia controversy, said John Dowd, the campaign's legal counsel, who also provided a statement in response to the news about the firing.

In a statement issued today, Dowd said "The timing of a press conference by Mr. Trump Jr. and Mr. Don Jr. is not in accord with the record of his election campaign, and Mr. Trump Jr.'s failure to disclose that evidence of any wrongdoing has been a major disqualification for him from the presidency.

"He is being misrepresented in this statement by his lawyer, who is a close advisor to the campaign of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was in charge of her own campaign and is now acting as the chief of staff to Ms. Clinton."

And in the same statement, Dowd said that "Mr. Don Jr. is not the party to the allegations of wrongdoing, nor to the way that it was dealt with in the first place. These are serious allegations. The Trump campaign and its staff have been working diligently to remove Mr. Don Jr. from office, and we will do everything in our power to ensure that this matter is brought to the attention of our duly elected officials."

This was an attempt to put Trump in a very different light, with a barrage of negative press coverage of him as he spoke out against the Russia investigation and questioned the press.

Trump Holds Small Lead in Conservative Kansas, Poll Shows

article:
But in a special election matchup, voters in the state are divided. Democrats would win the state and Republicans would be in a similar position.

The HuffPost Pollster/Marist poll surveyed 1,002 likely voters in Kansas, including 1,006 registered Republicans and 1,008 likely Democratic voters.

A similar survey conducted in the mid-Atlantic states of Virginia and North Carolina has the GOP out-maneuvering the Democratic challenger in the battleground nation of North Carolina.

In each of those states, which Democrats have carried in recent years, Democrats have won 59 percent of registered voters, compared with 54 percent for Republican candidates.

The survey, which also included 823 likely Iowa and 721 likely New Hampshire Democrats, is the first of its kind in the nation, and the first poll to be conducted since Iowa and New Hampshire last month. The poll polled 1,014 likely voters across the country and found Republicans beating Democrats by 60 percent to 30 percent.

In Iowa, Democratic candidate Ed Rendell (R), who has been in the race for months, has led by two points in the past week despite having lost a single seat by six points.

In North Carolina, Democratic candidates have won by six points, and in North Dakota, Democrats have won by seven points with just over a month to go.

A third poll in New Hampshire has the Republican Party holding strong in several key battleground states this week, including Colorado, Iowa, Nevada and Pennsylvania.

In Nevada, Republican candidate Joni Ernst (R) is on track to win the state, while GOP challenger Scott Brown (R) has been downgraded from an automatic Republican target to a potentially contested Republican target.

In Pennsylvania, Republican candidate Katie McGinty (D) is now in the lead following the defeat of Democratic challenger Ken Cuccinelli II, and a third poll earlier this week had the Republican candidate trailing by four points.

In Maryland, Republican candidate Catherine Cortez Masto (R) is holding a lead that could be even bigger than her previous two-point lead. The poll, conducted Dec. 24 to 26, had Cortez Masto at 42 percent and Masto at 27 percent.

In Florida, Republican Ben Ray Luján (D) would lose the state to Republican challenger Ed Gillespie (R) by more than two points, and Republican candidate Steve King (R) would lead by three.

The poll also found the Republican ticket holds strong support.

The Election May Hinge on Pennsylvania. Can the Polls Get the State Right?

article:
After the last election, there have been multiple reports of the outcome of the gubernatorial race – and the lack of confidence in the electoral process. A new paper by the Pennsylvania Office of Elections found that the majority of Pennsylvania's voters are not willing to consider any outcome of the race.

The Pennsylvania Legislature and the state's House of Representatives have repeatedly refused to consider any election results that could affect their own party. Governor Patrick Corbett has repeatedly refused to consider any election results that could affect his own party. He has even refused to hold a hearing on a proposed state budget.

Pennsylvania's new law will likely have a major impact on the state's political landscape. The new law would prevent Pennsylvania from being a party that decides who needs to be in office in advance of the November presidential election. This law is a big deal in a state that is the only state in the country that doesn't have a party.

The PA Election Integrity Project has documented three separate scandals involving Pennsylvania's electoral process over the last year. The first was the corruption scandal that erupted last summer when a group of state officials, including a lieutenant governor and several county commissioners, voted to drop out of the race. The second is the ongoing investigation of a corruption scandal by a state committee that was led by John O'Keefe, a former Pennsylvania state senator who later ran for president and lost.

The third scandal is that the Pennsylvania Legislature has not even considered the possibility of any new election results for the next two months. It is unclear if the legislature will seriously consider a new election outcome after the November election. Pennsylvania is already under a federal court order to resolve issues related to the election.

There have also been reports that some of the state's Democratic and Republican parties are calling for a recount of election results. Democrats have been seeking recounts of the votes that have already been counted. Republicans have been demanding recounts of the votes that have already been counted. The two sides have met this week at the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, where they have met in an effort to ensure that more Pennsylvania votes are counted.

Pennsylvania's new law would mean that the state would need to count its electoral votes in more than two months. The Pennsylvania Legislature is the only state that hasn't decided to count its votes, meaning the state would have to vote in its 2016 elections or face an extraordinary challenge from the Democrats.

The legislature also needs to make sure that the Pennsylvania law is enforced.

Supreme Court Bars Curbside Voting in Alabama

article:
A conservative group has asked the Supreme Court to rule on whether or not it can allow an Alabama court to block a state law that protects gay marriage.

On Thursday, the Supreme Court's 5-4 majority decided whether to hear the case of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging the Alabama law, which allows gay couples to have the right to marry in any state. The case is being considered in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit — one from Alabama and one from Texas — cite a state law that was passed in the early 1990s that prevents a judge from allowing same-sex couples to have the same vote in the state when the state constitution allows a constitutional amendment.

The plaintiffs, who are based in Texas but are seeking a temporary injunction to block the state law, say they are trying to make the situation in the state more difficult for their clients.

Under the current law, if a state legislator approves the marriage of the couple who live in the state and who are a natural-born citizen, the voter-approved marriage would automatically be recognized as valid and could take effect within a decade.

The plaintiffs have asked the court to rule on whether or not the state law is constitutional, according to the lawsuit. The order issued by the 5-4 majority on Thursday allows the plaintiffs to file a brief.

They said the justices should be more certain the state constitution does not allow them to use the power they have to block a marriage law in other states.

"The justices should be more certain that the Constitution does not allow federal officials to intervene in the state through state statutes passed under the guise of protecting the interests of the state or the interests of the federal government," the plaintiffs' lawyer, Joseph D. McInerney, said in a brief to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

The plaintiffs have called on the court to rule on the state constitutionality of the marriage law. They also want the justices to rule on a constitutional amendment that would overturn the constitutionality of the marriage law in the state by declaring that it violates the Constitution, they said.

The plaintiffs also say that since the Supreme Court denied a request from the plaintiffs to see the case before it is heard, they have filed two lawsuits on behalf of the plaintiffs.

An attorney for the plaintiffs said he would be sending a letter to the court on Friday.

Trump Issues Order Giving Him More Leeway to Hire and Fire Federal Workers

article:
At the end of 2012, Republicans were able to win a majority in the House that would have allowed them to override a veto by President Obama on an immigration law that would have sent tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants to the U.S. mainland.

This week, Senate Republicans in Arizona announced that they would vote to override a Senate-passed Republican measure that would have allowed them to fire federal workers if they couldn't provide enough money to pay for services they didn't provide.

After a month of wrangling in the Senate, the GOP-controlled House won a measure in December that would have given the president until January 2017 to sign a law that would have given the president the authority to fire federal workers if they provided no more money to pay for things like food, medical care and other basic services, or if they didn't provide any money at all.

If the president didn't sign the law by that date, the Republican-dominated Senate would remain in place.

On January 19, an Arizona Republican and his wife, Kelly, filed a lawsuit against Trump, claiming that the president had ordered the Trump Organization to pay for the legal costs of hiring and firing federal workers when he had already issued a new deportation order — even though the administration was already working on a contingency plan to do so.

The suit says that Trump and his White House lawyers, in fact, were ordering the administration to pay for legal fees for the suit while there was still time to file lawsuits.

The judge overseeing the case said on Monday that the court would hear the suit and that federal courts that have jurisdiction to hear the claim must hear the request from the Trump Organization within 90 days.

The suit also asks the court to order the Trump Organization to pay legal fees for the legal costs of the suit, including costs caused by the administration's legal team, and for costs that would have been incurred by the Trump Organization if the lawsuit had gone forward if the costs were not paid.

The suit also asks the court to order the Trump Organization to pay attorneys' fees, as well as attorneys' costs incurred by the Trump Organization during the previous legal proceedings.

If the litigation is tried before an administrative law judge, the government could not be forced to pay the costs of the case. The cost would only be made available to the government if it could prove the government had improperly employed legal counsel, according to the suit.

Trump told The Associated Press on Monday that he planned to fight the lawsuit.

Parents Are Worried About Schools. Are the Candidates?

article:
In a recent poll, just 18 percent of respondents said they could not see why they are worried about the state of schools, which has seen a record yearlong record of a large number of low-performing schools and rising graduation rates.

The poll also found that nearly a third of respondents told the New York Times they were worried about the state's schools in 2014.

When asked what they thought about the school-to-prison pipeline, 43 percent said they were worried, compared with 42 percent for federal officials who said the pipeline was a burden that needed to be addressed. Thirty-seven percent said they believed the government wasn't doing enough to address the problem of the high rate of teacher attrition, while 29 percent said the government wasn't doing enough to address the issue of the continuing financial challenges teachers face.

The results suggest that while the rhetoric over the past week has been largely focused on school choice, with Democrats accusing Republicans of wanting to "tear down the great schools," the Democratic Party wants to stop the federal government from privatizing every aspect of education.

In a report released this week, the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern Virginia released a report on state and local school choice in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage.

The organization has been critical of the state's public schools, calling for changes that would allow the state to choose when to open schools to parents, parents who are not part of the majority of public school students, and parents who are more likely than not to be parents who are not registered to vote.

It also said the current system of school choice "is not a good fit for the children of America, for our children, our children."

It said the report's findings were especially alarming given the recent decision by Chief Justice William Rehnquist to strike down part of the current system of school choice, which was designed to address the large number of people who are not registered to vote.

The report also noted that the number of schools open to students under age 18 has been declining for several years, and that an increased number of teachers and administrators have been hired in recent years.

It called for a review of all state and local government initiatives to ensure that the state isn't creating a system in which every school is equal, not with one student at a time, but across time, and that the state does not have a system in which everyone who goes to school is treated equally.

Debate Preview: There Will Be Muting

article:
As the election approached, a new president was coming to power. In the past week, a number of experts and pundits have floated the idea that a Trump presidency, with the president-elect's signature campaign promise to nominate a Supreme Court justice and a Supreme Court appointed by the president to fill the vacancy, could be problematic, and potentially disastrous. A president is likely to be able to appoint justices, and they will fill the vacancy through a combination of party nominating conventions and presidential elections.

But a Trump presidency, and the presidency of a woman running for a Senate seat, would not be the only choice. As The Washington Post reports, more than a dozen other members of Congress have filed a complaint with the Obama administration, asking federal judges to overturn a federal judge's ruling to prevent the president from opening a federal gun buyback program in 2015.

And in an interview with the Washington Post's Dana Bash, former Obama administration official John F. Kelly, a longtime Clinton ally and the secretary of Homeland Security under President Obama, said that the Senate would be "a nightmare for the president."

"The Senate has a serious problem with the president," Kelly said.

There is one other possible choice for Trump in the 2018 election. The White House could nominate another Supreme Court nominee, who could be a woman elected to the bench, to fill the vacancy.

Or, if a president is elected, the president could choose a woman appointed by the Supreme Court. If so, she would be a "very good choice" to fill the vacancy.

At a time when the conservative-leaning Republican Party is gearing up to field a candidate in a Trump-related primary, the possibility of a Supreme Court vacancy is highly unlikely. The last Supreme Court nominee, John Roberts, served as a Republican chief justice since 1979.

The Supreme Court has often been a source of concern for Republicans, and one of the most significant political controversies of the Obama years involved the decision of Justice Antonin Scalia, who served as a conservative justice whose death in a high-profile 1973 Supreme Court case — in which he wrote a dissent — caused some to question whether the court had anything to do with the president's foreign policy.

The last Supreme Court justice to serve as a Supreme Court justice was Justice Samuel Alito Jr., who served as a liberal on the court during the Reagan administration and served in the Supreme Court from 1986 to 1993.

How the Internet Viewed the Presidential Debate

article:
Some of the Republican candidates were speaking from their own homes, making their own comments on how the media would be able to identify them.

On Thursday, Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., was asked if the Republican Party would be able to identify him in the final eight weeks of the campaign. He said he doesn't know.

He said: "If you look at the political world, if we see somebody who's running a very conservative party, the problem is that it's not possible to identify everybody. And that gives us a clue — one that we can begin to see. And there are a lot of different things that go on."

At a Tuesday night rally in Virginia, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was asked about his own running mate, former Gov. Gary Johnson. Sanders said he didn't know.

"I would not tell you who my running mate is, but you know who Gary Johnson is," he said. "You know what I mean? That's a really big question. I've never been involved in any kind of serious campaign. I don't want to be a personal person, and I don't want to be a political person."

And after announcing that he was running for president in 2016, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, was asked if the media would be able to identify him in the final eight weeks of the campaign. He said that was a question he had not been asked before.

"Well, that's a really big question, isn't it? I mean, look at the Republican Party today, and the Democratic Party, and even the party of Lincoln," he said. "I mean you have to look at everything and try to identify people in the last eight weeks. And then you have to look at things like what they might do as they go. So as you start to identify potential candidates, they will look at what they have done. And it's not really possible to know what they might do in the final eight weeks of the campaign."

That may give some candidates a window at what they will do as they head into the final weeks of the campaign.

Even if Trump were to clinch the Republican nomination, it is not clear that his supporters will see him as a viable political force in the final two weeks of the election.

Democrats have made it clear that they want to see Trump as the front-runner from the start.

4 Key Biden Moments at the Final Debate

article:
Biden is the Republican nominee, and that may be why he got such a surprising victory in Florida.

As a young man, Biden became a staunch Republican who often talked about his support for the president and his opposition to the Iran nuclear deal. But he was also a staunch Democrat, and he was the best-educated Republican in the state, even though he voted for Romney.

At the Republican National Convention, Biden took a strong stand against the Iran deal, saying the agreement was a "bad deal" that would do no good for the American people.

He made clear that he wanted to see the deal go away, but he didn't want to change the rules.

Biden also opposed both the Iran deal and the so-called "sequester," which would require congressional approval of the Iran nuclear deal before any kind of deal can be struck.

In an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday, Biden said the deal "is not a good deal by any stretch of the imagination."

But he did not call for any other changes to the deal, only for it to go away.

The Democratic nominee said he was proud that the Supreme Court would rule in the 2016 election that the Obama administration had the authority to freeze the nuclear deal.

"I think the Supreme Court would be pretty proud of us if we won every election in America, and if we won all 50 states, and I mean, that's very pretty impressive, to be in that position of being the party of this country and the party of this country, and we had a majority of states that voted for us," Biden told Cooper.

When asked about his position on the Iran deal, Biden said "there's got to be some changes, and I think the president is very clear about what he wants to do with the Iran nuclear deal, and to that end he went off the record on the Iran deal, saying that we have to stop it."

The Republican nominee said he did not vote for the Iran deal because he did not want to alter the rules. He also said he did not want to change the rules about who is allowed to have nuclear weapons, as Romney did.

The president's decision to make Biden a senator, and his decision not to be a member of the Senate Republican leadership, on his campaign trail is probably a sign he could do some significant work.

4 Key Trump Moments at the Final Debate

article:
A look back at the final presidential debate.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump gave the final Republican debate in a series of interviews before heading off on his own campaign Sunday afternoon after he said he would not "cancel" his campaign.

The former New York mayor called his call to cancel the debate, which was supposed to come on Wednesday, "disappointing and frankly not a good strategy," and said it would have been better for his campaign if Trump didn't.

"I know what you're thinking — this is a very difficult thing to be a part of," he said. "But you know what? I think it's going to be really, really difficult. It's going to be really, really difficult for me to be part of this team."

Trump said he expected the debate to have "a little bit" of the kind of "drama and a little bit of an argument" that so many Republican candidates have had during their campaigns.

Trump, who has not endorsed the Republican nominee for president, said Sunday morning that he would not cancel the debate, saying he had been told to do so by his campaign.

"We will continue to fight together. We will continue to fight. We will be a nation of laws and we will be an American nation," he said. "We will be great again."

Trump, who is running for the White House, said Sunday night that he did not know if he would cancel the debate. He said he thought he would.

Trump said on Saturday, after a meeting with his campaign chairman, John Podesta, that he had told him to "keep in mind, if I don't win on Sunday, if it takes one of us, the way we're going to be able to stay together, that's fine."

But on Sunday, after the Democratic nominee conceded the race, Trump took to Twitter to say Trump did not know he would be the Democratic nominee.

That statement came after the third presidential debate, which Trump said the Democrats were winning.

Trump said he expected to win the vote from the voters in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Alabama, but did not say how many.

The third presidential debate — which concluded on Sunday night — will be the first of many debates held in the fall on the country's most important issues. Trump has said polls are "rigged" against him and said he expects to win the national popular vote by double digits.

Democrats Try to Shut Down Senate, Seeking to Stain Barrett Confirmation

article:
Senate Democrats are also trying to put the Senate's final vote on the filibuster down to two votes, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell Jr. said.

The Senate Minority Leader is urging senators to put the process down to only one vote — or 60 votes.

McConnell is the main deadline-setting vote, which is typically taken in July. The Senate is expected to pass the legislation before the October deadline.

Democratic leaders have said they want the Senate to pass the legislation before the November election. But they have also said they want to prevent the filibuster from affecting the Senate's election results.

"It is not the only part of the Senate that we have to consider," McConnell said on CNN Wednesday. "We have to look at other parts of the Senate. All the other parts of the Senate are also important. But it is not the only part of the Senate that we have to consider."

President Trump on Wednesday called Trump's action "an extremely important step" but didn't cite any specific examples.

On Wednesday, the White House warned senators that the Senate was not in a position to close the deal, though some Republicans said they could still be persuaded to support it.

In a statement, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the action a reminder that the Senate had not agreed to the deal and the House had not agreed to open up the deal, which gives the president more time to sign a bill before the election.

The White House said that the Trump administration had not sought to block the Senate's vote on the deal.

The Senate has been working on the Senate-passed legislation for two years, and it has been a major legislative accomplishment so far.

In response to a letter from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell Jr. sent Wednesday, Trump wrote, "We have been working on legislation that will make it easier and faster for Americans and other citizens abroad, including the United States, to have their voices heard in the Senate. We will begin work in earnest in the coming weeks to ensure that this process does not become a partisan process. To that end, our administration intends to work with our partners who have worked tirelessly to close the deal in the past to ensure that, for all Americans, this process is a fair process when it comes to our democracy.

Day After Debate, Biden and Trump Amplify Attacks, Seeking an Edge

article:
A number of Republicans are calling on Obama to resign or face impeachment if he were impeached or convicted of something.

The Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus, said he will be the first to publicly demand Biden resign and the next day the Republican Party would be calling for his impeachment on Day One of the campaign.

"I'm so outraged this week, I don't know what to do. People want to be president, and the next day, I think they're going to be furious," Priebus said.

In an interview on CNBC Friday night, Trump suggested Biden was not impeached after the investigation into his conduct into his campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, was confirmed.

"I don't think Biden. If you look at the record of what happened before the 2016 election, he was very open and honest with the New York Times and the New York Post, and he's said the same thing many times," Trump said. "But even if he were to resign, he'd have the right to do just as he did with the FBI investigation into his campaign. And that's what he's doing as the president of the United States, is he's making the very same statements that he used to in 2016, and I'm not going to call that what he said, and I'm not going to call it what he said in 2016."

The Trump campaign responded by claiming Biden never said he was asking permission to fire Manafort.

"Mr. Biden, I am in no way saying that he never said that he was asking permission to fire a special counsel for this investigation. But that is not what Mr. Biden said," a spokesman said. "It was clear to Mr. Biden that he was asking for permission to fire a special counsel. Mr. Biden did not say he was asking for permission to fire a special counsel for the FBI, nor did he say he was referring to an investigation into his campaign or any other matter. Mr. Biden also did not say the same thing publicly. He said he was asking for permission to fire a special counsel."

During a press conference Friday, Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., said his dad knew about Manafort and did not know of any specific investigation into him.

Huge turnout in New York on first day of early voting.

article:
More than 80 percent of the total cast in New York is male and a significant proportion of Hispanics, who are voting in large numbers, are female.

A similar trend was observed in other states in 2012. In many states, turnout among the poor has reached levels that were not present on Election Day when Obama won in the White House.

In a separate survey conducted just before the election, more than 50 percent of registered voters said they were not sure how to vote in New York.

The federal government also said it expects to count more than 1 million provisional ballots in the first half of the week.

Those figures, if accurate, would take into account all of the ballots counted in the United States.

The Electoral College and the popular vote count are based on the counting of votes in states with a large number of registered voters. The Electoral College is the most widely used federal election process.

The Electoral College, known as the balloting process, is designed to determine the percentage of votes counted and which states will be counted in the year.

The Electoral College does not count ballots cast by registered voters. It does not count ballots cast at a polling place for election purposes.

The Electoral College also is not designed to determine who the president will be. It is the official election process of the United States.

In the first-day of polls, polling places in dozens of swing states showed much of the nation casting ballots, including some in New York and Philadelphia.

But turnout in each of those states was about as strong as it was a year ago when Obama won the 2016 election, according to data released Wednesday by Election Day Inc., which tracks U.S. election data.

Of those who cast ballots, nearly half voted at home, with more than a quarter in New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania — and more than four in Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Idaho, Nebraska and Washington, D.C.

In most states, the turnout was down from the previous year as turnout among registered voters soared. In New Hampshire, about 20,000 did not vote by ballot box on Election Day, compared with about 16,000 for the previous year.

The Democratic National Committee said it had received about 1 million more votes than expected from registered voters, and had about 1.4 million more than anticipated from voters of all registered races.

The Democratic National Committee said the number of registered voters in New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin had surged by about 1 million.

Far-Right Groups Are Behind Most U.S. Terrorist Attacks, Report Finds

article:
In the wake of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the right-wing organizations behind those attacks focused their attention on a particular group of people — the Muslims who are most critical of the administration — and took the opportunity to attack Americans, calling it "radical Islamic terrorism."

But according to a report released this week by the State Department, the "Muslim Brotherhood is the most dangerous group of people who support and participate in the U.S. government" while the president and his administration are at it, and they are, in fact, responsible for the attacks of September 11.

The report found that the Muslim Brotherhood, which calls itself "Muslim Brotherhood of America," has led the attack on Americans in the past. It has also been the one that has targeted Americans, and the report points out that the Muslim Brotherhood is leading the attacks against Americans.

In other words, the U.S. government is directly responsible for the attacks of Sept. 11, according to the report, and the government is responsible not only with those attacks but also with attacks on American citizens.

In the case of the Muslim Brotherhood, the report found that in just the first six months of the year, the attack against American citizens had taken place mostly at the local level. That included the attack on the U.S. Embassy in Cairo in October, in which six Americans were killed and another killed in a car bombing and an attack on a U.S. diplomatic convoy in Yemen in December.

In addition to taking credit for the attacks on Americans, the Muslim Brotherhood claimed the attacks were largely retaliation for the U.S. administration's decision to pull out of the Paris, France, climate accord, which the group said would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.

The report said that the Muslim Brotherhood, which has led the attacks in North Korea, has been responsible for "a series of counterinsurgency operations against American military and civilian installations throughout the world — including that in Somalia and Syria."

The report also found that the Muslim Brotherhood has been involved in the attacks on U.S. Navy ships in the Middle East, including an attack on the USS Cole and an attack on a U.S. Marine base in Yemen, and it was the most senior Muslim Brotherhood figure in the U.S.

At Dueling Rallies, Campaigns Present Starkly Different Visions on Virus

article:
In addition to the recent news about the virus and virus-powered vehicles that were being used to fight off the virus, there are a number of other developments that have made the campaign a little more complex.

In part, this is because the campaign has been set up in a similar manner to the one that's been used in the past. In order to run an actual campaign with a virus-resistant vehicle, it would have to be done with a virus-resistant version of the vehicle itself.

But this time around, the campaign has been set up on a different model using a virus-resistant vehicle. That means that even though the campaign is set up on a virus-resistant version of a virus-resistant vehicle, they have not come up with a way to run it.

The first thing they've done is set up a database of the viral genes in vehicles that they would need to run on the virus-resistant vehicle by using a virus-resistant virus. They then send them to the campaign to see if there's a virus-resistant virus on the vehicle, and they do.

So if they see no virus, they have a virus-resistant virus, but if their virus-resistant virus is on the vehicle, they send it to a virus-resistant virus. So you know, with this campaign, the virus-resistant vehicle is a little bit less powerful and so they're going to be more cautious.

The campaign also has a process where campaigns are required to use all of the virus-resistant virus-resistant virus-resistant vehicle capabilities they have on the virus-resistant version of the vehicle. Then any virus-resistant virus-resistant virus-resistant virus can be run on the virus-resistant version, and that's the process.

And that's what they're going to do: they're setting up a database and they also have their own virus-resistant virus database.

The second thing that they've done is set up a campaign with a virus-resistant virus that has not been run on the virus-resistant virus. They want to have a virus-resistant vaccine that they would use on the virus-resistant version. So they send that virus-resistant vaccine to the campaign.

The campaign also has the option for each campaign to have at least one virus-resistant virus-resistant vehicle. That includes virus-resistant vehicle-specific vaccine that they would use to run the campaign.
